3930001 jason marriage is like a car i know every part every nook and cranny of this car like the back of my hand i can tell when its running well and i can tell when something needs tuned i never let it go for long and ill spend hours making it right even if i hear a rattle ill take apart the door or whatever part of the car to fix it marriage is no different you need to learn to be so in tune with your wife that even when you make a mistake and fall short you know exactly what you need to do to fix it having a nice shiny car on the outside might appear good and feel nice but if everything under the hood is breaking down what are you really left with youll probably just go look for a new car but the issue isnt the car its you your wifes inner and outer beauty are a direct reflection of your leadership and willingness to serve and honor your wife

3930006 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
3930007 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
3930008 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
3930009 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3930010 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3930011 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3930012 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
3930013 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
3930014 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl

3930034 entonces la uni n astron mica internacional uai organiz el proceso de recalificaci n
3930035 cuando ellos hicieron el recuento vieron que buena parte de los que no participaron en la votaci n eran compatriotas y supuestamente favorables a sus tesis
3930036 por ello ahora lo est n cuestionando cuando en realidad los que votaron eran miembros de una comisi n especializada en nomenclatura planetaria
3930037 la mayor a de la gente relacionada con la astrono m a que no forma parte del movimiento patri tico de eeuu apoya la decisi n de la uai

3930066 as the 19th century came to a close the american electorate changed more and more rapidly
3930067 a military force serving the interests of the democratic party
3930068 revive the dead and hateful race and sectional animosities in any part of our common country
3930069 means confusion distraction of business and the reopening of wounds now happily healed
3930070 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less
3930071 with the election of harry truman democrats began the fight to bring down the final barriers of race
3930072 democrats began to bring down the final barriers of race
3930073 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science
3930074 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3930075 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3930076 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3930077 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3930078 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
3930079 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
3930080 who will be the next president of the united states
3930081 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3930082 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
3930083 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
3930084 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
3930085 going after your opponent for being of the world seemed a bit jarring a bit odd
3930086 their campaign really seems pretty out of touch with what the american people want to see and hear during the olympics
3930087 theyre using a gigantic stage to make their national case against obama
3930088 it doesnt seem to be causing any uproar they may have guessed right
3930089 focused on ensuring that voters have the best information possible to make an informed decision on election day
3930090 i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3930091 unlike barack obama harley owners appreciate open roads and open markets
3930092 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
3930093 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
3930094 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
3930095 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
3930096 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
3930097 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
3930098 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3930099 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3930100 propensity to vote is in part based on enthusiasm but its more typically assessed using voting history and intention among other factors obviously for election outcomes all that matters is whether people vote not whether they do so enthusiastically a challenge for obama is to convert highly energized supporters there is currently an enthusiasm gap favoring obama into registered voters and then into actual voters
3930101 when youre talking about campaign funds they cant be used for personal use you cant use campaign funds to buy yachts or go out to barbados
3930102 friends can give gifts to people up to a certain limit beyond that its income to the recipient
3930103 whether its an in kind contribution if they were paying her for something that was not campaign work probably not
3930104 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its commitment to georgias territorial integrity that commitment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their commitment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense commitment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3930105 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3930106 sen john mccain said that he is open to choosing a pro choice running mate and named former pennsylvania governor tom ridge as someone who merits
3930107 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3930108 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3930109 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3930110 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3930111 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3930112 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3930113 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3930114 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3930115 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3930116 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3930117 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3930118 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3930119 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3930120 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3930121 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3930122 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3930123 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3930124 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3930125 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3930126 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3930127 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3930128 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3930129 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3930130 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3930131 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3930132 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3930133 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3930134 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3930135 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3930136 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3930137 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3930138 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3930139 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3930140 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3930141 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3930142 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3930143 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3930144 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3930145 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3930146 just so you all know we did set a record
3930147 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3930148 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3930149 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3930150 doesnt look like all those presidents on the dollar bills
3930151 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
3930152 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
3930153 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3930154 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3930155 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3930156 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3930157 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3930158 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3930159 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3930160 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3930161 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3930162 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3930163 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3930164 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3930165 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3930166 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3930167 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3930168 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3930169 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3930170 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3930171 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3930172 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3930173 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3930174 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3930175 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3930176 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3930177 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3930178 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3930179 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3930180 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3930181 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3930182 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3930183 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3930184 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3930185 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3930186 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3930187 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3930188 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3930189 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3930190 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3930191 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3930192 support the arizona republicans positions calling for the building of 45 new nuclear power plants and allowing oil drilling off of the nations coasts
3930193 that shows how out of touch he is with michigan voters
3930194 hes pandering to san francisco liberals and environmentalists who would just as soon we not have cars
3930195 believes that adding 45 nuclear reactors in the united states will help reduce dependence on foreign oil
3930196 my message here today is that we should take our lead from the french i never thought id say that
3930197 the economic cost of a cap and trade bill would hit michigan especially hard the increase in energy costs would compound the loss of manufacturing jobs in the state and reduce the disposable income of michigan residents
3930198 michigan would lose 37 400 to 56 260 jobs in 2020 and 91 490 to 121 786 jobs in 2030
3930199 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3930200 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3930201 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3930202 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3930203 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3930204 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3930205 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3930206 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3930207 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3930208 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3930209 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3930210 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3930211 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3930212 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3930213 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3930214 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3930215 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3930216 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3930217 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3930218 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3930219 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3930220 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3930221 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3930222 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3930223 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3930224 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3930225 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3930226 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3930227 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3930228 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3930229 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3930230 im not a hypocrite i dont see things as right left i see things as right wrong so just because the people at fox like the sean hannitys of the world dont want to accept that theres climate problems theres enough information out there that im concerned
3930231 so al gore says were going to put a set of commercials together where two enemies get together on one cause and say lets support this so theyre going to get donald trump and rosie odonnell to do one and me and my arch enemy to do one
3930232 i gave them two dates because i was doing the movie and i was doing my family vacation and then i had to get the sound track ready for the movie get my album ready the 35 hits do a ford truck commercial and start rehearsing for the tour
3930233 just one of those unfortunate things it could still happen
3930234 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3930235 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3930236 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3930237 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3930238 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3930239 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3930240 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3930241 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3930242 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3930243 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3930244 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3930245 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3930246 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
3930247 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
3930248 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
3930249 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
3930250 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
3930251 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
3930252 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
3930253 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
3930254 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
3930255 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3930256 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3930257 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3930258 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3930259 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3930260 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3930261 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3930262 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3930263 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3930264 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3930265 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3930266 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3930267 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3930268 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3930269 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3930270 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3930271 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3930272 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3930273 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3930274 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3930275 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3930276 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3930277 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3930278 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3930279 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3930280 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3930281 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
3930282 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
3930283 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3930284 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3930285 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3930286 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3930287 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3930288 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3930289 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3930290 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3930291 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3930292 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3930293 creo que podemos elaborar un programa de licitaci n bueno que no s lo beneficie a los que m s dinero tienen sino a los que proponen el mejor proyecto tanto en materia de cobertura como de desarrollo
3930294 el tema central para que esta estrategia tenga xito ser el que estas redes peque as ubicadas en localidades remotas puedan conectarse con otras redes adem s de que posean una adecuada capacidad de transporte
3930295 cada quien desde su punto de vista ha actuado en conciencia y responsabilidad personal yo respeto todos los punto de vista
3930296 la apertura y transparencia en la informaci n relativa a la topolog a de las redes son factores indispensables las respuestas a los requerimientos de informaci n y documentaci n a las empresas de telecomunicaciones muestran que tal apertura es inexistente o parcial
3930297 ven a telcel y te damos el doble de tiempo por 8 meses
3930298 no hubo nuevas inversiones para este a o por los juegos ol mpicos el hecho de que no vaya la selecci n mexicana le resta mucho atractivo las televisoras dejaron de vender mucho
3930299 no hay como el futbol y las campa as pol ticas aunque esto ltimo ya no lo tienen con la reforma fue un golpe las olimpiadas dejan utilidad pero no son tan rentables
3930300 con lo cual sigue apoyando a sus clientes a trav s de productos y servicios soportados por tecnolog as de vanguardia y de clase mundial
3930301 nuestros insumos y los costos de operaci n tales como energ a el ctrica combustibles insumos para la construcci n cobre y mano de obra han incrementado sensiblemente sus precios
3930302 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3930303 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3930304 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3930305 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
3930306 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
3930307 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
3930308 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
3930309 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
3930310 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
3930311 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
3930312 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
3930313 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
3930314 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
3930315 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation

3930321 despu s de las ca das lorenzo ha cambiado de alguna manera su estilo de pilotaje con el fin de mejorar su confianza en la electr nica de la moto
3930322 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3930323 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3930324 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3930325 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3930326 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3930327 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3930328 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3930329 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3930330 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3930331 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3930332 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3930333 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3930334 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
3930335 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling
3930336 meanwhile the demand for takeaway pizzas and mcdonalds has risen as people find the cheapest way to eat
3930337 environmentalist did not make gas go to over 4 gallon
3930338 i dont want to have to change my life even it it benefits society as a whole
3930339 humans are an infinitessimally small part of the global eco system
3930340 its the downturn that has made greenery look unappetising but it may yet prove to do more than anything to save the planet
3930341 it runs on biodiesel and im gonna put solar on it someday
3930342 recently mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
3930343 mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
3930344 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself

3930360 creo que tenemos el mejor equipo ol mpico de la historia y nos va a dar grandes satisfacciones en el atletismo no hay milagros y solo hay que mirar el ranking queremos como m nimo igualar las cuatro medallas del 92 y superar los 10 finalistas del 2004 en atenas creo que podemos estar entre 12 y 14 finalistas ocho primeros clasificados
3930361 es verdad que todav a no salto bien los obst culos pero lo importante no es saltar bien sino llegar primera a la meta solo he corrido dos veces esta prueba pero ya es la que m s me gusta es como si la hubiera hecho toda la vida si hace falta correr por debajo de los 9 minutos lo puedo hacer

3930387 unfortunately some special interests have declared war on the initiative process using tactics ranging from restrictive laws to outright thuggery
3930388 representative government will remain the enduring feature of american democracy but the initiative process is a valuable safety valve attempts to arbitrarily curb the initiative or to intimidate people from exercising their right to participate must be resisted its a civil liberties issue that should unite people of good will on both the right and left
3930389 i believe in the initiative and referendum which should be used not to destroy representative government but to correct it whenever it becomes misrepresentative
3930390 put front and center empowering the american people in direct democracy format so they can move in when their so called representatives cave in to the interests of big business campaign finance reform has got to go hand in hand with direct democracy like initiative referendum recall
3930391 more direct democracy reflecting the preamble to our constitution which starts with we the people and not we the corporations
3930392 played vital roles in facilitating enabling or abetting the employers fraud
3930393 culture of corruption that continues to impede efforts to fight that corruption
3930394 outer and visible signs of organized crime influence have been significantly reduced
3930395 will be able to police itself without court and government supervision
3930396 makes clear that massive job site corruption was taking place from the 1990s through 2006
3930397 it is too early to tell whether recent reforms will achieve the purpose of showing whether the union can police itself without supervision
3930398 the district council must demonstrate that the unions efforts to combat corruption have reduced the frequency and scope of corrupt practices to the extent that this court is convinced that the union and its constituent locals can adequately police themselves without further government involvement and court supervision
3930399 at the present time the district council has not made that showing
3930400 conditions within rural and regional australia remain generally better than 12 months ago and agricultural markets remain strong
3930401 war disrupts trade which is where the real money is made
3930402 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3930403 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
3930404 during the past year many of the top social networking sites have demonstrated rapid growth in their global user bases
3930405 facebooks recent ascension to become the top global social networking site has been spurred by its substantial growth across worldwide regions
3930406 i came back last year and played 28 games and scored 10 goals i made an impact and ill do the same again this year whether it means ill play less games or more well see
3930407 we face a tough market in the year ahead but we are well placed to withstand these conditions with a proven business model clear strategy and sound property skills
3930408 we are budgeting for a nominal increase in earnings per security in financial year 2009 but it is going to be tough and we are assuming that market conditions do not deteriorate further
3930409 looking through the current cycle we expect to achieve higher earnings per security growth from financial year 2010 onwards
3930410 we have seen a steep decline in confidence in the australian reit real estate investment trust sector in recent months and were disappointed to have been impacted
3930411 we are intent on restoring confidence through our focus on value creation for our security holders and our sound balance sheet puts us in a good position to do so
3930412 our residential business also performed well despite deteriorating buyer sentiment and our ability to once again grow profits through a tough residential cycle demonstrates the quality and diversity of our business
3930413 active asset management and low occupancy costs should enable us to deliver further operational upside despite the recent slowdown in consumer spending
3930414 we remain of the view that the medium term prospects for the australian residential market are favourable due to high immigration and significant supply constraints
3930415 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3930416 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbour occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3930417 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the us defence department
3930418 we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3930419 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3930420 we just reacted because we didnt have any other option any civilised country would act same way i may remind you september the 11th the reaction was similar american citizens were killed you know the reaction
3930421 russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3930422 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3930423 when we look at bank profitability we find that australian banks are around the top of the international range
3930424 on the surface this could indicate a lesser degree of competition than elsewhere
3930425 but when we look a bit deeper it seems that an important reason for the high profitability of australian banks is their unusually low bad debt experience
3930426 this has been the result of the very strong domestic economy
3930427 it is also worth noting that other australian industries have been very profitable over this period
3930428 history shows that it is new entrants that drive competitive behaviour
3930429 it is also important that this information be in a form that is easy to understand
3930430 our view of recent events is that they are cyclical in nature rather than a permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when market conditions settle securitisation will pick up again
3930431 comunicamos ao presidente evo morales que estamos dispostos a ir at o pal cio de governo da cidade de la paz ainda hoje
3930432 when we look at bank profitability we find that australian banks are around the top of the international range he said
3930433 on the surface this could indicate a lesser degree of competition than elsewhere
3930434 but when we look a bit deeper it seems that an important reason for the high profitability of australian banks is their unusually low bad debt experience
3930435 this has been the result of the very strong domestic economy he said iga didnt miss chance metcash

3930500 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3930501 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3930502 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3930503 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3930504 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3930505 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3930506 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3930507 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3930508 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3930509 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3930544 i really like living here and the staff are great they even change my light bulbs for me when they burn out as i cannot get up on a step ladder anymore i really appreciate them all
3930545 i can tell you that god is alive because i talked to him this morning
3930546 i must stress once again that the fabled theme of the languid adolescent girl has nothing whatsoever to do with sexual obsession except perhaps in the eye of the beholder
3930547 i paint angels all my feminine figures are angels apparitions people think it is eroticism which is perfectly absurd my painting is essentially and profoundly religious
3930548 there is something obsessive about him he wasnt right in the head
3930549 there is something disturbing here the position of her legs her sexual awakening fire is a symbol of passion and that man with no shirt we dont know what he was doing beforehand or afterwards
3930550 then i put it all together i recognized happy days in a catalogue all the details but the fire and the man didnt exist
3930551 in the late 1950s and early 1960s when alabama was last in everything education highway funding progress in civil rights the one thing people could take pride in was the success of the alabama football team
3930552 the georgian side could still maintain lower gas prices they could compensate for gas price by trading off some assets for example armenia had already paid gazprom with its transportation network
3930553 we treat each and every detainee in our custody with the same high level of quality professional care possible
3930554 we have a product oh ya and you can learn with it too
3930555 i am grateful to fran spielman of the chicago sun times and abc channel 7 news for making people aware of the suffering in the westside and southside of chicago
3930556 we know these are hard times with rising prices for food and gasoline but water bills need to be paid
3930557 we are very sympathetic to our customers situations and will work with them to resolve past due bills
3930558 it is draconian but you cant say its not fair because its owed people need to come in and work out payment arrangements before they get these shut off notices
3930559 ive got a problem with it but i also belong to the legislative body we cant possibly raise any more property taxes and were facing layoffs
3930560 we need folks to pay for water that they use but its a bad economy we need to be sensitive to how we collect if we have a good payment plan and it doesnt have to be the current one then we meet them half way
3930561 forget about google they are having probs so here is good old fashioned xls
3930562 mandate prison programs in the u s to lower crime rates
3930563 while these services will be a powerful force in our lives they are a potential privacy nightmare
3930564 these services are all being sold to consumers as only providing real benefit no one is talking about the fact they are about building and collecting more data not just about the content you like but where you go and where you are at the moment
3930565 this is a way for the user to take their location to the web for every site on the web to become geo aware and to respond to where users are
3930566 switchboard that anyone can build on top of and we are the bit that helps connect to other services out there
3930567 fire eagle is neutral and open and the main thing we do is give people control to choose how much information they want to share and change it at any time
3930568 we only store your current information and dont keep any historical logs that information will stay there until you over ride it or change it
3930569 fire eagles features are beyond our comfort level as far as the average internet users is concerned
3930570 part of the problem is that yahoo cant control what the companies they partner with do with the information
3930571 while this is an opt in service you have to be clear about the consequences of what you are opting in to
3930572 people are social beings and people lie they tell fibs they want to buy presents for their partners go for job interviews and have secret and illicit affairs
3930573 people live rich and varied lives and its not our job to flatten that out we are here to make the world respond to you
3930574 if we get millions of consumers using the service and have thousands of applications we think it will be good for yahoo
3930575 we want our services to be location aware as well and obviously the more consumers that are willing to use it the more we will be able to tailor our services to them and the better it is for us
3930576 advertisers have yet to catch up to the possibility this space offers and fire eagle makes it that more explicit for them so i think we will see more targeted adverts coming into being that can take advantage of a persons location
3930577 we want to give advice next time dont have things like this that challenge the people of islam
3930578 that which is enshrined in the federal constitution need not be discussed
3930579 if there is insufficient evidence to act then there will be no action by the government
3930580 but if there is hard evidence for action to be taken then its up to the kdn home ministry to decide
3930581 it is a jihad because this individual anwar should not be given the chance to destroy the countrys political stability and prosperity if we allow him to lead the country he would lead us to destruction
3930582 in our reply to an earlier warning letter from the same person we remarked that the home ministry had not defined the concept of religion in the application form for the renewal of printing permit nor is there a definition of religion found in the federal constitution
3930583 so we asked them to point out where we had gone wrong we are awaiting their reply
3930584 the article was an ethical analysis about the world after the sept 11 attacks on the world trade center towers
3930585 bolivia needs institutional mechanisms to channel conflicts but they cannot be developed overnight
3930586 the weakness of bolivias institutions which predates this government by a long shot makes it very difficult to absorb and reorient a process of social transformation like the one that they are trying to carry out in bolivia
3930587 it is very difficult to ask a historically excluded sector of society to sit down and engage in dialogue with another that it perceives as having exploited and excluded it for centuries
3930588 to the contrary of some triumphant interpretations the referendum is a clear defeat for the government which not only reinforces the de facto division of the country but gives the separatist subversion a halo of legality that it did not previously enjoy
3930589 the hand over of power to the neoliberals or civil war
3930590 the steps taken by neighbours in first place brazil and then argentina are important as far as possible they should resort to the regional architecture which has a strong legal tradition
3930591 bolivians are calling on their political class to sit down and negotiate agreements that is the referendums most eloquent message
3930592 the political actors who are facing off are playing around with the country on the edge of the abyss

3930597 were just glad we were able to get to them
3930598 they were only allowed to stay for two hours and had to return home

3930786 the u2charists are an attempt to reach the young adult crowd which has an ambiguous relationship with organized religion but u2charists have not begun anything novel here they are typical in their structure as far as liturgy goes entrance word eucharist communion and dismissal
3930787 it utilizes the cultural elements a certain population young adult culture uses to make sense of life incorporating them into their religious practices

3930795 barbara really doesnt know what is going on in courtneys life only what she overheard and acquired from opening an email that she shouldnt have in the first place she only knows what she assumes if she were questioned she should only note what she has observed at work i e calling in sick several times and being late for work

3930800 that the american republic and the catholic church are working together under the same divine guidance forming the various races of men and nationalities into a homogenous people and by their united action giving a bright promise of a broader and higher development of man than has been heretofore accomplished
3930801 in the union of catholic faith and american civilization a future for the church brighter than any past
3930802 the catholic church has preserved unity without encroachment on individual liberty and has preserved individual liberty without the loss of perfect unity

3930804 the catholic religion alone is able to give unity to a people occupying so vast an extent of territory embracing such a diversified population and of such a variety and even conflicting interests

3930813 i pray that the community spirit stays strong in all these communities and that the floods cant drown the love we feel for our neighbors in times of need
3930814 many waters cannot quench love neither can floods drown it
3930815 there is a kind of prayer that leaks out between the panels of the work
3930816 art cant be separated from the spiritual any creative activity is an act of prayer

3930824 im turning out an artifact that is inarguably jewish it was a debt i could repay to the jewish community that i could not accommodate by ritual observance

3930831 up to 80 of homes and buildings in the historic district of savannah are haunted
3930832 why are you troubled and why do doubts rise in your minds look at my hands and my feet it is myself touch me and see a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see i have
3930833 jesus shows a familiarity with ghosts in this passage he even notes the difference he is flesh and blood whereas a ghost is not

3930865 the most effective initiative though politically difficult would be a major expansion in quotas for skilled immigrants
3930866 perhaps 150 000 of those are loosely classified as skilled
3930867 a double or tripling of this number would markedly accelerate the absorption of unsold housing inventory for sale and hence help stabilize prices
3930868 while local economies may experience significant speculative price imbalances a national severe price distortion seems most unlikely in the united states given its size and diversity
3930869 i think the worst of this may well be over

3930878 apa artinya dia bilang aku tidak dapat mendengar percakapan orang dia bicara dibalik atau benar benar tak mengenali penyamaranku
3930879 biasanya kita suka bicara di sini apakah kau sudah bosan pada kata kataku
3930880 selamanya kau tak bisa mendengar ucapanku tentu aku takkan bicara padamu
3930881 nenek bisu engkau sangat baik aku sering mengajak kau ke sini dan mengutarakan isi hatiku kepadamu selamanya kau tidak merasa jemu selalu menunggu uraianku dengan sabar sebenarnya tidak pantas aku membikin repot padamu tapi engkau memang sangat baik padaku mirip benar ibu kandungku sendiri aku tidak punya ibu jika punya apakah kiranya aku berani bicara padanya seperti kubicarakan padamu ini
3930882 air mukanya tampak kurus isi hatinya bila tak terbeberkan bisa jadi akan mengakibatkan jatuh sakit biarkan kudengarkan apa yang akan diceritakan asalkan dia tetap tak mengenali samaranku tentu dia takkan malu
3930883 hendaklah kau menemani aku duduk sebentar di sini engkau tidak tahu betapa kesalnya hatiku
3930884 pagi tadi ayahku hampir hampir saja mati gantung diri apakah kau tahu dia dikerek tinggi tinggi di atas pohon entah oleh siapa pada tubuhnya ditempeli pula plakat yang menyatakan ayah sebagai manusia tak berperasaan nomor satu di dunia ini manusia yang paling doyan perempuan padahal selama hidup ayahku hanya memikirkan ibuku seorang saja entah apa dasarnya tuduhan pada ayahku bahwa dia paling doyan perempuan tentu orang menempel plakat itu secara ngawur telah salah tempel plakat yang mestinya ditempel pada badan ayah padahal seumpama salah tempel robeklah plakat itu dan buang saja habis perkara kan tidak perlu gantung diri segala
3930885 ketika dian pek kong berlari lari ke kian seng hong untuk mencari diriku kebetulan dia kepergok oleh gi ho suci dian pek kong dianggap melanggar peraturan berani sembarangan datang ke kian seng hong tanpa banyak bicara gi ho suci terus lolos pedang dan menyerangnya hampir hampir saja jiwa dian pek kong melayang sungguh berbahaya sekali
3930886 tak peduli apa yang dia katakan apakah benar atau tidak sama sekali aku tidak boleh menggeleng atau mengangguk sebab si nenek bisu tuli pasti takkan mendengar apa pun yang dia ucapkan
3930887 ketika dian pek kong sempat menerangkan maksud kedatangannya sementara itu gi ho suci sudah menyerangnya belasan kali untung tidak terjadi cedera apa apa
3930888 aku mencarinya di sekitar lembah ini akhirnya kutemukan dia di belakang gunung sana kulihat beliau tergantung tinggi tinggi di atas pohon
3930889 kulihat di leher ayah masih tetap tergantung secarik kain yang tertulis manusia tak berperasaan nomor satu di dunia ini segala kukatakan kepada ayah orang itu sungguh jahat berulang dia menggantung engkau salah tempel kain tertulis ini juga tidak dibetulkan
3930890 sambil menangis ayah berkata bukan digantung orang tapi aku sendiri yang menggantung diri
3930891 tapi ayah menjawab plakat ini ditujukan padaku mana boleh digantung pada orang lain
3930892 coba nenek bisu bukankah aneh sekali ucapan ayah itu maka aku lantas tanya beliau ayah kau bilang kain plakat ini tidak keliru pasang sudah tentu tidak jawab ayah aku aku berdosa terhadap ibumu maka aku ingin segera mati saja kau jangan urus diriku aku benar benar tidak ingin hidup lagi
3930893 karena ayah menangis dengan sangat sedih maka aku ikut ikutan menangis sebaliknya ayah lantas menghibur aku malah katanya anak manis jangan menangis jangan menangis kalau ayah mati nanti tentu kau akan sebatang kara di dunia ini dan siapa lagi yang akan menjaga dirimu
3930894 kata katanya itu membikin tangisku semakin keras kemudian ayah berkata pula baiklah aku tidak jadi mati saja cuma rasanya menjadi tidak enak terhadap mendiang ibumu aku coba bertanya sebenarnya apa dosa ayah terhadap ibu
3930895 ayah menghela napas lalu menjawab dengan sedih sebagaimana sudah kau ketahui tadinya ibumu adalah nikoh sekali melihat ibumu aku lantas tergila gila betapa pun aku harus memperistrikan dia tapi ibumu menyatakan keberatan karena dia sudah menjadi nikoh khawatir dicerca oleh sang buddha
3930896 kukatakan aku yang akan tanggung akibatnya kalau sang buddha marah biarlah aku yang dikutuk ibumu menjawab bahwa orang partikelir seperti diriku adalah pantas kawin dan punya anak tapi ibumu sudah menyucikan diri bila punya pikiran menyeleweng tentu akan dimarahi sang buddha
3930897 kupikir ucapannya cukup beralasan juga tapi aku sudah bertekad akan mengawini ibumu untuk menghindarkan derita ibumu bila dihukum masuk neraka kelak biarlah aku menjadi hwesio kalau mau marah biarlah sang buddha marah padaku seumpama masuk neraka juga kami suami istri akan masuk bersama
3930898 alis perempuan muda itu melototi aku sambil bertanya kutanya dengan baik kenapa berulang kau menggoda aku apakah kau sudah bosan hidup aku menjawab menggoda bagaimana memangnya hwesio bukan manusia makanya tidak boleh punya anak kalau kau tidak percaya akan kubuktikan padamu tak terduga perempuan itu tambah marah segera ia lolos pedang terus melompat turun dan menyerang diriku bukankah perbuatannya itu keterlaluan
3930899 kukatakan pada ayah ya nyonya cantik itu memang rada galak sudah jelas aku adalah anakmu ini kan tidak bohong kenapa dia lolos senjata menyerang padamu jawab ayah maka cepat aku berkelit menghindarkan serangannya kataku he kenapa kau menyerang orang tanpa sebab anak ini kalau bukan anakku memangnya anakmu ternyata ucapanku ini membikin perempuan itu tambah murka berulang ia menusuk dari ilmu pedangnya kulihat dia orang dari hoa san pay
3930900 bahwasanya perempuan itu orang hoa san pay maka lantas timbul perkiraanku tentulah nona gak itu siausumoay lenghou toako nona gak itu memang punya perangai berangasan akan tetapi segera aku tahu dugaanku keliru sebab usia nona gak sebaya dengan diriku waktu itu aku baru berumur tiga bulan tentunya nona gak juga masih bayi
3930901 ayah berkata pula setelah serangannya tak bisa mengenai diriku dia menyerang lebih gencar sudah tentu aku tidak gentar padanya aku cuma khawatir dia melukaimu ketika dia menusuk untuk kedelapan kalinya mendadak kutendang dia hingga terjungkal
3930902 aku bilang mungkin ibu mendengar caci maki perempuan itu dan menyangka engkau benar benar telah menggoda perempuan itu
3930903 aku lantas tanya ayah kemudian engkau menemukan ibu tidak ayah menjawab aku telah mencarinya ke mana mana tapi tak bisa menemukannya kupikir ibumu adalah nikoh tentu dia masuk kembali ke biara maka setiap biara selalu kudatangi ketika kutemui gurumu ting yat suthay beliau sangat tertarik akan kemungilanmu tatkala itu kau sedang sakit lagi maka beliau lantas minta aku menitipkan dirimu di biaranya agar kau tidak ikut menderita kubawa kian kemari
3930904 sejak kecil aku ditinggalkan ibu berkat suhu yang telah membesarkan aku akan tetapi sekarang suhu meninggal pula dicelakai orang orang yang mencelakainya adalah guru lenghou toako bukankah hal ini membikin aku menjadi serbasusah
3930905 maka dapat ditarik kesimpulan bisa jadi ibuku sudah membunuh diri lantaran menyesal pada kelakuan ayah o nenek bisu tentunya ibuku adalah wanita yang berjiwa sangat keras dia telah berkorban bagi ayah dengan menanggung noda karena mau dikawin oleh ayah tapi baru melahirkan aku lantas melihat ayah menggoda perempuan lain dan dicaci maki sebagai orang yang rendah dan tak tahu malu sudah tentu ibu tambah marah dan putus asa mempunyai suami begitu makanya beliau lantas ambil keputusan pendek dengan membunuh diri
3930906 kemudian aku tanya ayah siapakah perempuan hoa san pay yang bikin celaka orang lain itu ayah menjawab perempuan itu cukup terkenal juga ialah bininya gak put kun kutahu hal ini dari pedang yang dia tinggalkan di atas tanah itu pada pedang itu ada ukiran namanya karena tidak dapat menemukan ibumu saking gemasnya aku lantas pergi ke hoa san untuk mencari gak hujin maksudku hendak membunuhnya untuk melampiaskan dongkolku setiba di hoa san kulihat dia sedang memondong bayi perempuan yang kelihatan sangat mungil aku menjadi teringat pada dirimu sehingga tidak tega turun tangan maka kuampuni dia ketahuilah nenek bisu bayi perempuan itu adalah nona gak sumoay cilik lenghou toako mengingat lenghou toako sedemikian menyukai siausumoaynya sudah tentu dia adalah bayi yang sangat menarik
3930907 setelah ayah menjelaskan barulah aku tahu mengapa ayah begitu sedih melihat plakat yang bertuliskan manusia tak berperasaan nomor satu di dunia ini orang yang paling doyan perempuan
3930908 ayah berkata sudah tentu tidak aku pun tidak bercerita kepada siapa pun
3930909 kemudian aku berkata engkau keliru ayah justru sang buddha memberkati agar tidak membunuh diri makanya tali putus sendiri dan pisau hilang mendadak kalau tidak saat ini tentu aku tidak bisa berhadapan lagi dengan engkau ayah bilang betul juga ucapanku besar kemungkinan sang buddha ingin menghukumnya lebih lama menderita di dunia fana ini lalu aku berkata pula semula kukira kain plakat yang tergantung di leher dian pek kong itu kukira tertukar denganmu makanya aku sedemikian marah ayah menjawab mana bisa keliru dahulu dian pek kong pernah berlaku kurang ajar padamu bukankah itu tepat dengan tulisan plakatnya kusuruh dia menjadi perantara agar bocah lenghou tiong itu menikahimu tapi dia selalu ogah ogahan dan tak bisa melaksanakan tugasnya bukankah ini berarti tidak becus bekerja seperti tulisan plakat itu jadi apa yang tertulis di plakat baginya itu memang sangat cocok dan tepat aku berkata ayah aku akan marah bilamana kau suruh dian pek kong melakukan hal hal yang tidak layak itu hendaknya diketahui mula mula lenghou toako menyukai siausumoaynya kemudian dia suka kepada yim toasiocia dari mo kau meski dia juga sangat baik padaku tapi selamanya tidak pernah menaruh perhatian padaku
3930910 mendengar ucapan itu tiba tiba ayah menjadi gusar dia mencaci maki lenghou toako katanya bocah lenghou tiong itu memang buta melek ada biji mata tapi tak bisa melihat sungguh lebih goblok daripada dian pek kong
3930911 masih banyak kata kata kotor yang dia lontarkan ke lenghou toako sukar bagiku untuk menirukannya
3930912 coba nenek bisu kan tidak betul ucapan ayah itu mana boleh dia mencaci maki lenghou toako cara begitu
3930913 ayah berkata pula kalau sudah masuk agama mengapa tidak boleh kawin jika semua orang perempuan di dunia ini memeluk agama dan tidak kawin serta punya anak kan di dunia ini takkan ada manusia lagi buktinya ibumu adalah nikoh tidakkah dia kawin dengan hwesio semacam aku serta melahirkan engkau aku menjawab ayah jangan lagi kita bicara urusan ini bagiku akan lebih lebih suka tak dilahirkan saja oleh ibu
3930914 lalu aku menyatakan pada ayah bila dia menyatakan hal itu kepada lenghou toako maka selamanya aku takkan bicara lagi dengan ayah bahkan tak mau bertemu pula
3930915 o nenek kepergian ayah sekali ini entah bila baru akan datang menjenguk diriku lagi entah pula beliau akan membunuh diri lagi atau tidak sungguh aku menjadi khawatir syukur kemudian aku dengar ayah baik baik saja selesai itu tiba tiba kulihat beberapa orang ini menuju ke lembah sini secara mencurigakan mereka sembunyi di tengah semak semak rumput entah apa yang diperbuat mereka diam diam aku menguntit ke sini untuk mengintai tapi malah kutemukan engkau nenek bisu engkau tak mahir ilmu silat juga tidak dapat mendengar pembicaraan orang bila kau kepergok orang kan sangat berbahaya selanjutnya jangan coba coba lagi main sembunyi di semak rumput begitu memangnya kau kira sedang main sembunyi sembunyi seperti anak kecil
3930916 akhir akhir ini gi ho dan gi jing suci selalu menyuruh aku giat belajar pedang
3930917 menurut cerita cin koan sumoay dia pernah mendengar gi ho dan gi jing suci berunding dengan beberapa suci yang lain mereka menyatakan lenghou toako tentu tak mau menjadi ketua hing san pay untuk selamanya sedangkan gak put kun adalah musuh pembunuh guru dan susiok kita dengan sendirinya hing san pay kita tidak sudi dilebur ke dalam ngo gak pay sebab itulah mereka ingin aku menjadi ciangbunjin
3930918 i have one eye looking very closely at developments back home i speak to people i have family there but im not going to rush anything
3930919 ive been here a long time i have a family here and its not just a case of upping and leaving and going back theres a lot to take into account i know a lot of zimbabwean professionals who are in a similar situation
3930920 you can ask for a favor but only once a year
3930921 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
3930922 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3930923 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3930924 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3930925 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3930926 the storango virtual drive will be a managed service that in 18 months will significantly enhance our revenues and earnings
3930927 nirvanix is optimized for media and enormous files like music and streaming high definition video so we see it as a platform that is future proof
3930928 you dont find many in the gang intervention world who can be effective in the street effective in the courtroom effective at city hall and effective in the prisons
3930929 he could calm everyone down and make us work together
3930930 la contralor a general de la rep blica pedir informaci n a palacio de gobierno con el fin de revisar los gastos que se hicieron en la organizaci n de la ceremonia por el d a de la juventud celebraci n que se realiz ayer en el patio de la casa de pizarro con la participaci n de la cantante damaris y de la orquesta de cumbia grupo 5

3930932 but the states leaders have failed to act therefore it is with great reluctance and with a sense of firm conviction that today i seek the courts intervention to secure this funding
3930933 lets get the budget done and everything will fall into place
3930934 obviously the states in a precarious financial situation right now but we have a responsibility to continue to work with the legislature to provide the receiver the resources he needs
3930935 when hardworking taxpayers cant even get health care in california
3930936 then and from a distance i admired very much the way she handled a uniquely difficult situation with uncomplaining grace
3930937 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3930938 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3930939 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3930940 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3930941 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3930942 she loved talking to kids because they would ask more honest questions
3930943 adults would kind of stand back and stare and not know how to approach her
3930944 do unto others as i would have them do unto me
3930945 i didnt want to go in the life raft he made me go he had my gun
3930946 that i would get shot he had just shot four people
3930947 that would be a normal coast guard procedure and not a nefarious underhanded attempt by the coast guard to obtain criminal information
3930948 for 63 years i had no reason to believe i would ever find out what happened to my father
3930949 i virtually had no hope of ever knowing what happened to my dad
3930950 i wouldnt say ive processed it i think im still a little shell shocked by it all
3930951 i dont know that the military even looked for him
3930952 i guess they figured he was gone and thats about it
3930953 im just so proud of him and what he did for his country
3930954 anything i can do to see he gets the honors he deserves thats what im working for
3930955 typically a 30 to 60 day review period is prudent and normal
3930956 with all due respect to entergys self imposed deadline fema owes it to the people and the state of new york to do a thorough evaluation
3930957 he was promised a severance and he should get his severance
3930958 its a slap in the face to the supporters of the university
3930959 it sends the message that its more about money than winning souls
3930960 you tell the critics mr roberts has done nothing wrong
3930961 he has not misspent and lived lavishly off oru money
3930962 there is no more fire season as we know it the fire season is now all year round
3930963 california is suffering from the same thing everyone else is
3930964 without question americas fire situation has changed its not going to go back
3930965 we cant afford not to fight fires homes and lives are at stake
3930966 these fires are only going to become more frequent and more intense
3930967 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
3930968 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3930969 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3930970 this is like something you would see in new york or pennsylvania or california but not here
3930971 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3930972 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3930973 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3930974 he controlled what they ate what they did he controlled pretty much everything
3930975 i asked did you go to help and they looked at me like it was the strangest question dad pretty much did whatever he wanted to do
3930976 the victims of this type of abuse theyre made to believe theyre not worthy of anything that this is what they deserve
3930977 its amazing they were not allowed outside they were simply not allowed to go near the door it all goes back to the control thing
3930978 i think its just hitting her what she is going through
3930979 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3930980 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3930981 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3930982 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3930983 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3930984 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3930985 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3930986 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3930987 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3930988 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand
3930989 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3930990 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3930991 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3930992 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3930993 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3930994 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3930995 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
3930996 i have to be careful because sometimes hell do a fast movement or run
3930997 but the other members arent as scared as i am

3931000 growth had strained linden labs software and residents suffered frequent crashes likewise software ease of use was a serious problem new users found tools that controlled movement communication and content creation to be very complex finally like most other large open online communities second life had trouble with antisocial behavior and fraud all these factors posed barriers to mass market adoption and contributed to high churn about 90 of new users abandoned their second life avatars after only a brief trial
3931001 second life was not a game it lacked a story line with well defined goals instead second life was a world entirely created by its residents
3931002 with something radically new and disruptive you always see a struggle between faith and skepticism
3931003 at linden lab employees were expected to choose their own projects they never got direct orders from a supervisor sometimes you will fail and in those cases it is very important to fail fast and fail publicly that is how we learn and iterate
3931004 the web provides a template its open but companies like google verisign and paypal earn huge profits by providing services like search domain registration security certificates and payments
3931005 rosedale had described linden labs role in fulfilling its new mission as akin to that of a public utility providing dependable electric power or telephone dial tone service but what did the transition from laboratory to utility mean for the companys culture and its distinctive management practices would current employees continue to find their work challenging and rewarding were new employees with different skills and attitudes needed as a utility did it make sense to continue to allow the lindens to choose their own projects
3931006 i guess the idea of the lindens trying to build a stable public utility must seem funny we look more like a group that would build a really compelling dance club

3931010 i dont think were really looking at taking any action against mr small and i need to emphasise that mr small has actually done nothing wrong and the horse is a victim of unfortunate circumstances here

3931014 your ceo of someone like that may have a disciplinary issue with a staff member today and tonight you may have that same staff member here in council it is just unworkable
3931015 what we want them to do if they arent going to take that out completely is to change it to what you had to do previously when you wanted to do that have a worker become an alderman to get the local government ministers permission
3931016 i dont think its a particularly a bad thing but wed like to see what plans they have for picking up the overflow of traffic and we hope its not pushing it out to the peripheral of the city because that will discourage people from coming in
3931017 these problems have been emerging for the last six to 12 years we have a record of inaction by our predecessors
3931018 what weve done is taken every possible measure available to us in the last six months to try and turn this disaster around and it is a real problem
3931019 i believe the lower lakes are an absolute environmental priority for the nation in which case governments of all persuasions need to do whatever is physically possible to make sure that this asset is preserved as best as is possible
3931020 weve begun that process weve dedicated 3 1 billion to the purchase back of further water entitlements across the system thats what were engaged in
3931021 cabinet will then look at what further measures will be possible to reduce the pressure on the system

3931076 rwanda is seeking extradition of four suspected masterminds of the countrys 1994 genocide
3931077 including a medical doctor who are living and working in britain the justice minister told reuters on tuesday
3931078 all these fugitives are living a comfortable life in the united kingdom but are surely key planners of the 1994 genocide
3931079 the dilemma we have is that most of these fugitives have changed their identities which makes it difficult for us to track them
3931080 for the fear of being tracked down and wrongly judged in rwanda or arusha ictr one of the three mayors had changed his name and applied for asylum as a former teacher the other one applied for asylum as a burundian citizen
3931081 this was not because what they might have done but because of the fear of being arrested and accused of genocide as it has happened to many others
3931082 he became a concern to kigali when he became a member of a task force advising the u
3931083 fergal keane was waiting for dr bajinya in front of the entrance door of his work
3931084 he was just in the street very early in the morning without any contact or warning if i can say shock and surprise you know my husband had never meet fergal keane before and now he keane was accusing him of genocide in rwanda
3931085 everywhere all the time he did not do anything we fled like everyone else suffered like every rwandan we lost many lovers family members and friends we went through the asylum process once we got to the u k and on our rwandan names this fergal keane story is all made up
3931086 why does the rwanda government suddenly want my husband now in 2007 sic after 13 years of war in rwanda
3931087 we all had different names and for our childrens future as they grow up in this country u k why can we not all have the same name brown once the law in this country gives us the full rights to do so
3931088 far from london weve uncovered evidence tying dr bajinya to horrific crimes
3931089 and today in this neighborhood where dr bajinya lived survivors recall a fanatic who searched for tutsis at roadblocks
3931090 they claim tutsi civilians even a three month old baby were amongst those killed by militia men he directed
3931091 dieudonne is one of several eyewitnesses who told us bajinya instructed the militia to kill
3931092 from our photographs dieudonne identified dr bajinya as the man he saw giving orders for murder
3931093 bajinya told them look this is not how you kill a man youre just playing with him he might survive if you just leave him the way he is so they killed him off it is an image of bajinya that stays in my mind
3931094 janvier mabuye says he heard dr bajinya ordering the killers to finish off a taxi driver who had already been attacked with machetes
3931095 janvier mabuye is not from dr bajinyas neighborhood and he is not a genocide survivor
3931096 like many other young tutsis he left rwanda after the october 1990 invasion to join the rpf in uganda
3931097 the doctor says both sides were massacred in rwanda and refuses to accept tutsis were victims of genocide
3931098 you believe there was no genocide of tutsis in rwanda
3931099 including severe beatings and most importantly witnessed his father being shot in december 2001
3931100 the medical foundation is not at liberty to disclose details of any individuals case and cannot confirm whether the person you refer to is a client of the medical foundation
3931101 before the victory of the rpf he was in charge of hygiene at a camp set up by the rpf in gabiro rwanda where the corpses of hutus killed by the rpf were burnt
3931102 the three primitive one story barrack blocks one with its roof being repaired are basic shelters for the rpf men at the gabiro army camp
3931103 it all looks devastatingly innocent a complex that may be an affront to the classic rolling african skyline but no more than that
3931104 it is easy to come to the united states and hide
3931105 americans dont know that amidst them are people who did very bad things
3931106 is a strong endorser of the genocide intervention network gin
3931107 as a promotion he was given the post of ambassador to washington d
3931108 the director of praxis reverend vaughan jones said if the allegations were true it would represent a betrayal of his organizations trust
3931109 i had no suspicions and when i saw the allegations i was very shocked
3931110 if they are true then i would feel betrayed because we work with people who have come from difficult situations and need proper support we are aware that there are all kinds of allegations and counter allegations in the community and sorting out the victim from the perpetrator is extremely hard
3931111 dr bajinya was immediately suspended as a result of the allegations
3931112 praxis has never attempted to form a judgment in relation to guilt or innocence that is the responsibility of others and beyond our competency
3931113 and how is it possible that tony kavutse an asylum seeker and
3931114 as soon as these reports came out by the bbc true rwandan asylum seekers stay away from praxis for fear that they will be identified and accused of genocide
3931115 there is a woman rose ngabire a tutsi who was working at praxis in dr bajinyas department who we know is a rwanda government informant
3931116 for example the guardian and very occasionally the london sunday times have been seen to have reporters who are assets of the u
3931117 this bajinya frame up was 100 set up by kigali and fergal keane
3931118 the spies at the rwanda embassy in london informed keane that they want dr vincent and they arranged for keane to go to rwanda to interview witnesses and come back here to accuse dr bajinya who all this time did not know anything was happening
3931119 using bbc south east england where vivenie mugunga was living
3931120 fergal keane convinced his producer andrew head to fund his investigation into the allegations and accusations by a south east england resident the fake asylum seeker vivenie mugunga about an u
3931121 after that fergal keane went to praxis with the hidden camera then he traveled to rwanda funded by the bbc of course he had contact with kigali because he was set up by the rwandan embassy here and he met with officials in kigali in his investigation in rwanda he shows that he found out that dr bajinya has been issued an arrest warrant keane speaks to the prosecutor in kigali who shows him the file submitted by kigali to the u k and then keane gets an rpf agent janvier mabuye to be his eyewitness and claim on the video that dr bajinya committed genocide and then finally he goes back to london and accuses dr bajinya
3931122 but there is also a deliberate policy on the part of the rpf regime to export exfiltrate tutsis to the u s canada belgium and other countries and a deliberate policy to forcibly return hutus to rwanda who fled to countries other than the democratic republic of congo they are worried that hutu asylum seekers outnumber tutsis in belgium and other countries and that if nothing is done in the long run hutus will be able to have their voice heard
3931123 the whole idea is to build a strong tutsi diaspora that would support the tutsi clique in power in rwanda the same way the jews support israel
3931124 with a strong tutsi diaspora tutsi elites in power can use the tools of negationism revisionism and the genocide industry to silence hutus in rwanda and in the countries where they have sought asylum
3931125 in 1985 tutsi exiles in uganda formed the rwandan patriotic front rpf having failed to negotiate their return to the country the rpf invaded rwanda from uganda in october 1990 demanding representation and equality for all rwandans 87
3931126 in 1994 people took shelter at a mosque in kabuga near kigali after the rpf took control of the location they killed all the people who had taken shelter there then called reporters to see what the interahamwe had done to tutsis
3931127 a civil war in the border area ensued each incursion by the rpf was followed by reprisal massacres largely of tutsis by government forces a peace agreement was brokered in 1993 the arusha peace accords which inter alia provided for a power sharing arrangement involving all political forces and the rpf
3931128 the rwandan government is strongly committed to national reconciliation and there is no evidence of any state sponsored or societal discrimination on ethnic grounds that would amount to persecution
3931129 the applicants name appears on either of the two published lists maintained by the rwandan government of those wanted for genocide or where there is any evidence that the applicant was for example politically active employed in any official religious media or military capacity at the time of the genocide
3931130 the war crimes unit was formed in march 2004 with the specific remit of introducing screening processes in order to identify people involved in the commission of atrocities in connection with modern day conflict situations
3931131 i have no time to waste in replying to you in the future
3931132 but as a gentleman i just wanted to tell you i exist and your facts are not correct
3931133 within rwanda legislation prevents anyone from questioning the official historical record
3931134 an investigation by bbc news has revealed that a man wanted for genocide in rwanda is living and working in britain
3931135 vincent bajinya has been working as a doctor and has served on a refugee task force for the government
3931136 he is just an intellectual hutu who managed to have a british citizenship and a good employment
3931137 every person who is not rpf or who does not share the same opinion with the rpf is the enemy
3931138 rwanda is seeking extradition of four suspected masterminds of the countrys 1994 genocide
3931139 including a medical doctor who are living and working in britain the justice minister told reuters on tuesday
3931140 all these fugitives are living a comfortable life in the united kingdom but are surely key planners of the 1994 genocide
3931141 the dilemma we have is that most of these fugitives have changed their identities which makes it difficult for us to track them
3931142 for the fear of being tracked down and wrongly judged in rwanda or arusha ictr one of the three mayors had changed his name and applied for asylum as a former teacher the other one applied for asylum as a burundian citizen
3931143 this was not because what they might have done but because of the fear of being arrested and accused of genocide as it has happened to many others
3931144 he became a concern to kigali when he became a member of a task force advising the u
3931145 fergal keane was waiting for dr bajinya in front of the entrance door of his work
3931146 he was just in the street very early in the morning without any contact or warning if i can say shock and surprise you know my husband had never meet fergal keane before and now he keane was accusing him of genocide in rwanda
3931147 everywhere all the time he did not do anything we fled like everyone else suffered like every rwandan we lost many lovers family members and friends we went through the asylum process once we got to the u k and on our rwandan names this fergal keane story is all made up
3931148 why does the rwanda government suddenly want my husband now in 2007 sic after 13 years of war in rwanda
3931149 we all had different names and for our childrens future as they grow up in this country u k why can we not all have the same name brown once the law in this country gives us the full rights to do so
3931150 far from london weve uncovered evidence tying dr bajinya to horrific crimes
3931151 and today in this neighborhood where dr bajinya lived survivors recall a fanatic who searched for tutsis at roadblocks
3931152 they claim tutsi civilians even a three month old baby were amongst those killed by militia men he directed
3931153 dieudonne is one of several eyewitnesses who told us bajinya instructed the militia to kill
3931154 from our photographs dieudonne identified dr bajinya as the man he saw giving orders for murder
3931155 bajinya told them look this is not how you kill a man youre just playing with him he might survive if you just leave him the way he is so they killed him off it is an image of bajinya that stays in my mind

3931194 but as a gentleman i just wanted to tell you i exist and your facts are
3931195 long has our nation the united states of america kept the forces of chaos at bay
3931196 by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe
3931197 the governments of canada and rwanda to not communicate through the media
3931198 as far as we are concerned there is no demarche by the canadian government on that issue complaint to un over karake
3931199 canadian representatives have inquired from un officials as whether it is convenient to have general karake continuing to undertake his duties on a peacekeeping force
3931200 karenzi karake was in the meeting that i attended he came in and went out i did not speak to him it did not bother me that he was subject to an arrest warrant
3931201 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3931202 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3931203 my winning this election is the victory of our people we will continue to work hard and bring peace and unity to our land
3931204 any organization that seeks federal funding to perform public health economic or educational development is required to provide demographic analysis on populations within specific geographic areas

3931227 ive built a quiet confidence within myself where the most nerve racking part was this right here the press conference
3931228 and that more than anything was just because we didnt have that in the ahl
3931229 i could tell right away when he walked through my office door that there was chemistry and that we were speaking the same language
3931230 i feel that my experience in providence will help me
3931231 we didnt have the team that anybody wouldve picked to win the amount of games that we did
3931232 it didnt just take coaching xs and os it took the players buying into the system that we play and being accountable to each other thats kind of the last step in my development as a coach in refining the team chemistry part of it how to get the guys to want to play for each other
3931233 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3931234 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3931235 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3931236 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3931237 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3931238 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3931239 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3931240 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3931241 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3931242 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3931243 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3931244 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3931245 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3931246 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3931247 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3931248 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3931249 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3931250 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3931251 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3931252 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3931253 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3931254 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3931255 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3931256 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3931257 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3931258 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3931259 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3931260 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3931261 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3931262 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3931263 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3931264 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3931265 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3931266 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3931267 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3931268 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3931269 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3931270 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3931271 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3931272 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3931273 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3931274 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3931275 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3931276 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3931277 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3931278 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3931279 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3931280 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3931281 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3931282 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3931283 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3931284 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3931285 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3931286 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3931287 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3931288 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3931289 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3931290 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3931291 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3931292 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3931293 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3931294 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3931295 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3931296 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3931297 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3931298 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3931299 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3931300 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

3931304 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3931305 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3931306 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3931307 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3931308 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3931309 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3931310 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3931311 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3931312 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3931313 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3931314 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3931315 who are open to doing something on the production side
3931316 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3931317 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3931318 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3931319 the big question is are the neighborhoods still against it
3931320 the city and county agreed verbally and in writing not to light darden towe

3931362 an analysis of the changing geographic distribution of low income workers and their families measured by receipt of the federal earned income tax credit eitc in tax years 1999 and 2005 nationwide and in 58 major metropolitan areas across the country reveals that the number of tax filers nationwide living in areas with high rates of working poverty increased by 40 percent or 1 6 million filers between tax years 1999 and 2005 by 2005 12 3 percent of low income working families lived in high working poverty communities zip codes where more than 40 percent of taxpayers claimed the eitc up from 10 4 percent in 1999 of 58 large metropolitan areas studied 34 experienced increased rates of concentrated working poverty
3931363 what are some policies we can put in place to encourage people to get microcars and drive them downtown instead
3931364 for any utility or other public convenience from which a revenue is or may be derived
3931365 tds wants the court to believe that a fiber optic network offering telephone internet access and cable television is neither a utility nor a public convenience
3931366 incumbent providers across the united states file these frivolous lawsuits to prevent communities from breaking their monopoly
3931367 consider a community using revenue bonds to build a swimming pool the community must hire employees before it generates a dollar of revenue
3931368 these startup costs have never been considered current expenses and minnesota supreme court has said as much
3931369 if our ancestors accepted tds position and there were many companies making the same points 100 years ago electricity would still not have reached many rural areas leaving us much worse off as a country
3931370 we hope the court rapidly dismisses this frivolous lawsuit and allows the democratic process in monticello to continue

3931373 its a washington where decades of trade deals like nafta and china have been signed with plenty of protections for corporations and their profits but none for our environment or our workers whove seen factories shut their doors and millions of jobs disappear workers whose right to organize and unionize has been under assault for the last eight years so today im laying out a comprehensive agenda to reclaim our dream and restore our prosperity its an agenda that focuses on three broad economic challenges that the next president must address the current housing crisis the cost crisis facing the middle class and those struggling to join it and the need to create millions of good jobs right here in america jobs that cant be outsourced and wont disappear for our economy our safety and our workers we have to rebuild america im proposing a national infrastructure reinvestment bank that will invest 60 billion over ten years this investment will multiply into almost half a trillion dollars of additional infrastructure spending and generate nearly two million new jobs many of them in the construction industry thats been hard hit by this housing crisis the repairs will be determined not by politics but by what will maximize our safety and homeland security what will keep our environment clean and our economy strong and well fund this bank by ending this war in iraq its time to stop spending billions of dollars a week trying to put iraq back together and start spending the money on putting america back together instead its also time to look to the future and figure out how to make trade work for american workers i wont stand here and tell you that we can or should stop free trade we cant stop every job from going overseas but i also wont stand here and accept an america where we do nothing to help american workers who have lost jobs and opportunities because of these trade agreements and thats a position of mine that doesnt change based on who im talking to or the election im running in you know in the years after her husband signed nafta senator clinton would go around talking about how great it was and how many benefits it would bring now that shes running for president she says we need a time out on trade no one knows when this time out will end maybe after the election i dont know about a time out but i do know this when i am president i will not sign another trade agreement unless it has protections for our environment and protections for american workers and ill pass the patriot employer act that ive been fighting for ever since i ran for the senate we will end the tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas and we will give those breaks to companies who create good jobs with decent wages right here in america

3931376 weve seen this in the past before in motorolas razr line it was a very big seller but the first version of that phone had rf radio frequency problems they had to recall it fix it and put it back out there

3931379 well he was high on pcp that why they had to beat him like they did
3931380 what we need is a critique of visual culture that is alert to the power of images for good and evil and that is capable of discriminating the variety and historical specificity of their uses
3931381 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
3931382 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
3931383 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters know is who uses that language for what purpose
3931384 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
3931385 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
3931386 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
3931387 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
3931388 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
3931389 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
3931390 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
3931391 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
3931392 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
3931393 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
3931394 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
3931395 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
3931396 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
3931397 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
3931398 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
3931399 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
3931400 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
3931401 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
3931402 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
3931403 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
3931404 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
3931405 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
3931406 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
3931407 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
3931408 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
3931409 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
3931410 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
3931411 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
3931412 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
3931413 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
3931414 i would say there are about 20 properties that have been flooded in this immediate area the water is up to some residents letter boxes one of my neighbours who had been away over night was in tears after she found her house flooded
3931415 everyone who parked in the car park in front of the flats has had their car written off by the flood waters
3931416 we need monsoon ditches like they have in the tropics because thats what the rains been like
3931417 weve got flooding on the farm itself with houses potentially about to be flooded so were taking action there immediately before we move on to try and clear some of the ditches
3931418 we had almost all of the 15 affected households with us this evening at the local school our first priority was to make sure that everyone was taken care of and had somewhere to stay
3931419 everyone was taking it very well considering the situation but once they recover in the next few days people are going to be asking why this happened and how it can be prevented from being repeated
3931420 we were ten to 15 minutes away from a much bigger disaster had the rain not stopped we would have been looking at hundreds of houses being flooded

3931456 what we now know about the alleged 9 11 hijackers
3931457 no evidence exists that any of the hijackers ever boarded planes that crashed on 9 11
3931458 part iii the context of 9 11 and meaning for the future
3931459 terrorism and statecraft al qaeda and western covert operations after the cold war
3931460 covert destabilization in new theatres of operation strategically close to russian and chinese influence namely eastern europe the balkans the caucasus and central asia
3931461 al qaeda is therefore a euphemism for western covert operations specializing in destabilization
3931462 terror assassination performed for reasons different from the publicized ones often initiated by persons or groups other than those suspected of the act and secretly perpetrated by or on behalf of the violated state itself
3931463 the left embraces a distorted notion of political violence that sees it as an understandable response of the weak to provocations of the powerful yet acts of terror are vulnerable to manipulation and far more likely to be a weapon of state rulers and their agents than of the oppressed masses as a legitimized protection racket the state may be tempted to inflict harm secretly on its own citizens to achieve highly desired goals
3931464 im amazed that so many athletes are wearing a fabric i tested in a laboratory in hampton virginia
3931465 what we look at are concepts for reducing drag on otherwise smooth surfaces this is more directed toward fundamental physics the interactions between the flow and the surface
3931466 we evaluated the surface roughness effects of nearly 60 fabrics or patterns in one of our small low speed wind tunnels
3931467 we were assessing which fabrics and weaves had the lowest drag the tests have generally shown the smoother the fabric the lower the drag
3931468 the fabric comes in the form of fabric tubes a small diameter fabric tube
3931469 we pull that over our smooth flat model which is an aluminum plate underneath we prepare the edges so theyre straight and square with no protruding corners or edges to interfere with the drag on the surface
3931470 we think that most stars in the galaxy are formed in dense orion like regions so this implies that systems like ours may be the exception rather than the rule
3931471 helps our understanding of the typical mode of star and planet formation
3931472 somehow the orion cluster environment is not conducive to forming high mass disks or having them survive long presumably due to the ionization field from the hot massive ob stars which you might expect would photoevaporate dust and lead to small disk masses
3931473 carma is an ideal instrument for this type of study with its 15 telescopes providing the fine resolution needed to resolve protoplanetary disks so that we can determine their structure and measure their masses more precisely
3931474 we are honored nasa selected the lifepak 1000 defibrillator to protect the lives of crew members onboard the international space station
3931475 the 1000 is used by thousands of emergency responders worldwide and was designed for use in the harshest environments and situations its proven to be one of the most reliable products physio control has ever developed this space first is especially exciting for us as it underscores the many reasons customers choose lifepak defibrillators for emergency medical use
3931476 when people understand the world of opportunity they can find through computers and the internet they are inspired to learn 21st century technology skills
3931477 many of the communities we visit are initially hesitant to embrace information technology but we remove this barrier by tailoring our programs to meet local economic health and educational needs and ensuring our approach aligns with the indigenous cultures in which we work
3931478 thanks to vasconcelos support and the increased access to technology in our community we are making education in our schools more effective and meaningful for our children
3931479 vasconcelos is transforming peoples lives by bringing information knowledge and hope to communities
3931480 its work is providing new opportunities for people young and old to improve the quality of their lives and ensure a better future for their families i hope vasconcelos example will encourage more organizations and governments to provide greater access to information and technology for those most in need

3931484 a municipal government should look no higher in its ambitions than the nearest pothole
3931485 we have heard concerns expressed about the original union airport rail link proposal and the province is currently in discussions with snc lavalin to find ways that the airport rail proposal can be changed to address a number of these concerns

3931510 id like to thank roy yamaguchi and the entire roys family for choosing hillsides as their charity of choice

3931512 buy real estate there will never be more of it
3931513 we have added outstanding investigators from many other institutions to our caltech mit team in order to ramp up our efforts in phase ii of the 21st century grand challenge to make solar fuels using materials made from earth abundant elements
3931514 the division of chemistry is pleased and excited to establish this new cbc devoted to elucidating some basic science aspects of solar energy research this center and its excellent team of researchers will enable nsf to partner with the scientific community to explore fundamental aspects of solar driven splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen
3931515 we are excited about our prospects as we are lucky to have a very talented and dedicated group of students and postdocs who are ready and able to tackle the fundamental chemistry problems that must be solved before it will be feasible to produce clean solar fuels on a large scale
3931516 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
3931517 because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a big if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
3931518 the phoenix project has decided to take an unusual step
3931519 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars
3931520 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
3931521 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
3931522 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates
3931523 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
3931524 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
3931525 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
3931526 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
3931527 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
3931528 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
3931529 this is a simplified version of what goes on in the human brain where we can look and control the basic features in the way that we want in a human brain you cant really do that
3931530 weve been getting calls from neighbors and people driving by theres a dog trapped on the island
3931531 the geese are very wary of them then eventually they figure it out
3931532 theyre very striking when you first come upon them i could see how it would be for someone driving by at 70 miles per hour
3931533 the shared experience of left 4 dead is unlike that of any other action game
3931534 thats what weve experienced playing the game and from showing the game to the press and our partners it sounds clich but in many ways you have to play this one to truly appreciate what were attempting so to give gamers a chance to sample this new type of experience first hand were taking left 4 dead on the road
3931535 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3931536 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3931537 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3931538 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3931539 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3931540 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3931541 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3931542 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3931543 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3931544 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3931545 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3931546 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3931547 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3931548 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3931549 this will help in mitigating the global food crisis we are sure that it will work wonders
3931550 it will save half our grain and will also reduce villagers dependence on food stock
3931551 the only issue is how people react to rat meat but i think it will not be a problem
3931552 some socially deprived people in bihar have always consumed rat meat if they can eat rats why cant the rest of the people
3931553 rat meat will make up nutrition deficiencies among villagers since rats are a major source of protein
3931554 take the necessary measures to establish diplomatic relations on the level of embassies in accordance with the united nations charter and international laws
3931555 our expectation is that any action will be consistent with the rule of law and the pakistani constitution
3931556 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats
3931557 democrats work for a living and they have to work and take care of their families and they say these are open to those in the community so they shouldnt ask people to drop everything in their lives for this
3931558 if these guys have a combined iq representing normal room temperature

3931572 i call it far and wide on account of the number of items it seemingly gets from as far away from england as possible
3931573 i grow my own vegetables so i know whats in season and i do get annoyed when theyve flown in veg from other parts of the world and its prices are absurdly high
3931574 perhaps it is inevitable that we might see some decline in demand among less deeply committed organic consumers but this is more likely to be a plateau than a reverse
3931575 it doesnt make sense to cut back on what it is a very economical way of eating especially on food where you know where it has come from and you can trust it
3931576 we have enthusiastic customers and i dont think that when the bank statement arrives they will take the organic veg box off their list i am fundamentally optimistic

3931600 tambi n la terminal de carga necesita mejoras y entonces estamos trabajando con gap pero estoy seguro que vamos a resolverlos los problemas
3931601 sal a hacer la estrategia encomendada por mi entrenador esta medalla es muy grande para mi hubiera querido que fuera el oro para dedic rsela a nuestro comandante fidel pues se merece todos los triunfos de nosotros estoy muy contenta con el resultado
3931602 when the president signs this act federal reserve act of 1913 the invisible government by the money power proven to exist by the monetary trust investigation will be legalized the new law will create inflation whenever the trusts want inflation from now on depressions will be scientifically created
3931603 there is no cause to worry the high tide of prosperity will continue
3931604 while the crash only took place six months ago i am convinced we have now passed the worst and with continued unity of effort we shall rapidly recover there is one certainty of the future of a people of the resources intelligence and character of the people of the united states that is prosperity
3931605 the theatrical performance known as the u s presidential election is perpetuated to keep the sheeple looking in the wrong direction so hopefully they wont notice the men behind the curtain its about as real as professional wrestling after the installation of the next president whoever he is itll still be business as usual well just have a new figurehead it matters little who sits in the oval office the same puppet masters will pull the strings no matter who it is
3931606 may i always be in the right place at the right time to do as much good as possible
3931607 lord if my brother sins against me how often must i forgive him as many as seven times
3931608 i say to you not seven times but seventy seven times that is why the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants when he began the accounting a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount since he had no way of paying it back his master ordered him to be sold along with his wife his children and all his property in payment of the debt at that the servant fell down did him homage and said be patient with me and i will pay you back in full moved with compassion the master of that servant let him go and forgave him the loan when that servant had left he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a much smaller amount he seized him and started to choke him demanding pay back what you owe falling to his knees his fellow servant begged him be patient with me and i will pay you back but he refused instead he had the fellow servant put in prison until he paid back the debt now when his fellow servants saw what had happened they were deeply disturbed and went to their master and reported the whole affair his master summoned him and said to him you wicked servant i forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to should you not have had pity on your fellow servant as i had pity on you then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back the whole debt so will my heavenly father do to you unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart
3931609 swimmers around the world are breaking records this year like never before including at the recent u
3931610 dont try to find you no home in washington dc cause its a bourgeois town uhm the bourgeois town
3931611 the realisation that i had an incurable disease that was likely to kill me in a few years was a bit of a shock how could something like that happen to me why should i be cut off like this however while i had been in hospital i had seen a boy i vaguely knew die of leukaemia in the bed opposite me it had not been a pretty sight clearly there were people who were worse off than me at least my condition didnt make me feel sick whenever i feel inclined to be sorry for myself i remember that boy
3931612 in my music im trying to play the truth of what i am the reason its difficult is because im changing all the time
3931613 fans for the past two weeks you have been reading about the bad break i got yet today i consider myself the luckiest man on the face of this earth i have been in ballparks for seventeen years and have never received anything but kindness and encouragement from you fans
3931614 when the new york giants a team you would give your right arm to beat and vice versa sends you a gift thats something
3931615 so i close in saying that i may have had a tough break but i have an awful lot to live for
3931616 symptoms then are in reality nothing but the cry from suffering organs
3931617 just get him up in a chair wheel him over to the office outside the hospital but close by put him on the table and do it
3931618 you know aint nuttin change but my limp cant stop till i see my name on a blimp
3931619 you are hereby directed to come in to the party headquarters and explain your comments and why you should remain a national delegate to the 2008 democratic national convention in light of these comments
3931620 we have skilled butchers scratch bakers and even our own store artists we have chefs fishmongers cheese artisans and team members handcrafting fresh foods right in front of our shoppers
3931621 i call it far and wide on account of the number of items it seemingly gets from as far away from england as possible
3931622 i grow my own vegetables so i know whats in season and i do get annoyed when theyve flown in veg from other parts of the world and its prices are absurdly high

3931625 we have enthusiastic customers and i dont think that when the bank statement arrives they will take the organic veg box off their list i am fundamentally optimistic
3931626 ive built a quiet confidence within myself where the most nerve racking part was this right here the press conference
3931627 and that more than anything was just because we didnt have that in the ahl
3931628 i could tell right away when he walked through my office door that there was chemistry and that we were speaking the same language
3931629 i feel that my experience in providence will help me
3931630 we didnt have the team that anybody wouldve picked to win the amount of games that we did
3931631 it didnt just take coaching xs and os it took the players buying into the system that we play and being accountable to each other thats kind of the last step in my development as a coach in refining the team chemistry part of it how to get the guys to want to play for each other
3931632 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3931633 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3931634 forget about google they are having probs so here is good old fashioned xls

3931636 when i was growing up i had a pretty difficult time

3931638 oh wii are you going to go home to play with yourself
3931639 its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective
3931640 i think the iphone would change some underlying infrastructure considerations from an enterprise perspective but apple have been pretty smart with the design
3931641 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
3931642 weve seen this in the past before in motorolas razr line it was a very big seller but the first version of that phone had rf radio frequency problems they had to recall it fix it and put it back out there
3931643 it could end up drawing more power because now the phone thinks its getting a worse signal than it actually is when it goes to talk to the network it speaks louder than it needs to

3931647 no no im totally happy to sit here all day i just havent taken a test in like 15 years so i really really really want to know if i past im totally fine to hang out

3931657 i dont want to take the mother away from her child
3931658 our first concern is the child but we have to do what we have to do
3931659 the whole time i was pitching sunday i was thinking about day 1 how when i started this season i was barely able to throw 78 miles per hour
3931660 and to the point where i am now and the season ive had i was just thinking darn how the season went together even though my arm was hurt i went out there and just battled every time
3931661 all the negative words you can think of they apply to us i have not been able to get these guys to play with passion or heart i dont know if theyre beat up or just really tired i dont know theres no sense of urgency and thats on me we played our whole season for these six games or thats what i thought anyway
3931662 i block that out of my mind i dont worry about that
3931663 hes just an incredible athlete and i wish him the best
3931664 we actually hung out a little bit this offseason at some different events
3931665 were fine we talk like normal people we dont worry about the comparisons
3931666 hes going to be great in this league all the best to him
3931667 i know im far from it i know theres a lot of hard work focus determination and patience involved you have to go out there and continue to work your way through it
3931668 i dont because when i look back on it there were a lot of things that were left on the field that could have been better and that could have helped me out and could have helped the team out
3931669 i noticed it as soon as we got our offensive line together i noticed ours was bigger than everybody else we have good size but we have good athletes we dont just go for size we go for athleticism and size we have three pro bowlers in the offensive line
3931670 i dont think their size seemed to be a difference
3931671 i think they are a good sized offensive line theyve been running their scheme for a long time they won super bowls with it they are good at what they do it presents an interesting challenge for us
3931672 you dont see their scheme very often they come at you from all angles i didnt notice the size i was too busy trying to read what was being done
3931673 we have a young team a lot of new guys and dallas is one of the top three teams in the nfl
3931674 it is a good measuring stick to see exactly where were at and how far we need to go
3931675 we get a chance to work against a 3 4 look and they get a chance to take a look at a four man front
3931676 i thought it was good for both teams it was a very healthy practice and there was some good fresh hitting you go against somebody where you dont know their tendencies so i think everybody plays a little bit more honest and its a good evaluation process for us
3931677 a lot of clubs have workouts together and there is a big fight all the time and neither team gets a whole lot out of it
3931678 i think mike does such a great job here getting his team to do the right things so that way we had a great workout i thought both teams got a lot out of it and i know we did
3931679 when we worked against them last year i thought we improved more in that week than any time in training camp its an opportunity for us to come here and we appreciate them having us here
3931680 it meant a lot to me what he said and im just going to take what he said and use it to push myself to get back sooner
3931681 yeah its tough its tough but its something ive been through before so ive just got to stay positive get focused and get back right so i can get back on the field
3931682 i cant really deal with the past ive got the future right now i got drafted i got my foot in the door ive just got to do what i can to say positive
3931683 we brought in a couple corners that we thought would give us more depth at that position guys that we feel have more of a chance to make our football team
3931684 mike shanahan and myself we have a bond from the 02 season when i was here he understands what i can do
3931685 yeah i didnt walk through the doors yet they dont let me inside
3931686 of course im getting frustrated because i feel i have what it takes to get out there and make it happen

3931740 africa progress panel responds to the g8 summit in hokkaido
3931741 g8 countries have done little to show how they will fund the shortfall of us 40 billion in programmable aid and debt relief identified by the africa progress panel last month the g8 has yet to present clear timetables outlining future aid provision or to provide increased transparency required to improve the quality of aid
3931742 the panel welcomes the commitment of us 10 billion to support food aid and measures to increase agricultural input as a necessary first step more needs to be done however to increase the supply of food to the worlds most vulnerable citizens and immediate measures must be taken to relax export restrictions on commodities such as rice
3931743 the panel welcomes the g8 leaders commitment to the conclusion of an ambitious balanced and comprehensive doha agreement as wto negotiations enter this crucial period all parties need to understand that the attainment of the millennium development goals rest in large part on the ability of the continent to trade its way out of poverty
3931744 the success in supporting african development will not only result in tangible benefits for her people but ensure a more secure and prosperous future for the world for g8 leaders helping africa to help itself is not a question of altruism it is a matter of self interest

3931754 there were areas in the inner cities where violence has forced individuals within a 30 square feet radius to remain there for years they cannot go up the lane down the lane or anywhere else because of violence the end result is this heart breaking situation
3931755 the males have never left it their communities to find a girl so they prey on each other it is an unending web and sometimes we read about this happening elsewhere and think it cannot happen here
3931756 there are cases where mothers have turned to their sons because their husbands or spouses are in prison and they go to her sons to fulfil her sexual needs
3931757 i am aware of it we have never had a case to deal with it at fathers inc but there are at least four communities where there are just too many instances of this happening
3931758 i have come across situations where during the investigation of a crime you find everybody with the same surname in one instance i interviewed 30 persons and they all have the same surnames
3931759 they were brothers sisters cousins and friends it got to a point where you say wait a minute what is happening here only to retrace your steps to find that they are all family in the sickest kind of ways
3931760 they are the product of the same lineage and this cannot be good for any country and any community can you just imagine the maladjustments of this generation of young people
3931761 this is well known we know this already i work in an inner city community and this is something i know very well
3931762 the police face a dilemma oftentimes we do not have a case there are no complainants to a crime there are those who will say the police have a responsibility to act yes we do but when you have unwilling relatives parents included who will deny it what do you do
3931763 that is so common there are so many stories and actual cases i had to insist to a don that i do not want to be in his company if he was going to be having sex with underaged girls
3931764 tell them that the girl must be at least 16 years
3931765 if the residents were not willing to report murders it was unlikely that they were going to report incest

3931768 voor gem is lowlands de offici le aftrap van een grote najaarstournee langs nederlandse clubs dus voor ons is het heel spannend we hebben al een keer eerder op het festival gespeeld en dat was een geweldige ervaring de sfeer is zo goed het publiek is ook kritischer dan het standaard festivalpubliek ze kennen de muziek echt hoe obscuur ook nee dat maakt het er niet enger op ik voel juist een enorme drive om te knallen voordat we het podium opgaan drinken we samen een biertje nemen de set door en wensen elkaar veel plezier ik heb eigenlijk geen ritueel zoals een kruisje slaan of mijn jas binnenstebuiten dragen
3931769 the roots wil ik absoluut live gaan zien zij zijn zon beetje de enige band die hiphop overdonderend op een podium weet neer te zetten verder staan n e r d blood red shoes en de flaming lips op mijn lijstje en anouk ik heb haar nooit live gezien het schijnt echt geweldig te zijn de sex pistols tja ik ben niet vies van hun muziek en ga ook zeker even kijken al zou het een grote teleurstelling kunnen worden want ze zullen nooit zo wild en punk zijn als in hun hoogtijdagen
3931770 natuurlijk staat bovenaan ons eerste optreden maar ook die keer dat ik slash een grote rockheld van mij in het wild op het terrein spotte dat ik zomaar de gitarist van guns n roses voorbij zag lopen zoiets kan dus alleen op lowlands
3931771 twintig minuten voor het optreden houden we een twintig minuten durend band only moment we praten wat drinken een pintje en ik doe mijn stem en mondoefeningen we hebben al aardig wat festivalervaring dus zenuwachtig ben ik niet optredens op lowlands zijn altijd memorabel het optreden uit 1999 spant voor mij de kroon we hadden toen een grote groep dansers meegenomen echt een spektakel ik denk dat we nu ook een goede set gaan spelen onze laatste plaat vantage point is gemaakt om live te spelen we houden het heel compact weinig pauzes tussen de nummers door ik hou er niet van om met het publiek te praten dat haalt het tempo uit je optreden ik vind de muziek belangrijker dan klapvee aanmoedigen
3931772 jamie lidell ga ik zeker zien we hebben al eerder met hem op een festival gestaan en hij heeft een erg goede show het is heel anders dan mensen zullen verwachten de sex pistols vind ik totaal oninteressant dat zij op het festival staan is ergens wel sneu het toont aan dat hedendaagse bandjes erg braaf zijn moet de enige punk attitude nu echt afkomen van een stel zestigers
3931773 dat was in 1999 toen we met die dansers optraden na het optreden hebben we met het hele gezelschap de hele backstage op zn kop gezet er gebeurden vreemde dingen zo was er een danser bij die dacht dat hij een stuntman was op zijn bmx fiets is hij midden in het kampvuur terechtgekomen gelukkig raakte niemand gewond
3931774 daar sta je dan een oude kerel tussen al die jonge honden lacht maar als zelfs ruud lubbers het lowlands publiek weet te vermaken dan kan ik het ook het is niet moeilijk om theater te maken op een festival gewoon een kwestie van doen natuurlijk is het lawaaiig en heb je te maken met dronken lieden die grappiger denken te zijn dan jij daar kan ik wel goed mee omgaan trouwens gewoon een spitse opmerking terugmaken en ze zijn stil voordat ik het podium opga dan eh tja ik rook meestal een shaggie dat is het
3931775 ik vind het vooral leuk om me te laten verrassen ik loop gewoon wat rond en als ik iets interessants hoor blijf ik staan de leukste ontdekkingen doe ik in de juliet tent waar veel stand up comedy en theater is daar moet je dus zeker heen
3931776 ik heb ooit straattheater gedaan op lowlands ik had een grote kartonnen doos omgebouwd tot huiskamer waar ik een mini performance gaf aan drie tot vier mensen dat was erg leuk om te doen mensen hadden het idee dat ze even ergens anders waren de laatste show in die doos was hilarisch er waren tien mensen ingepropt en met zn allen hebben we het interieur aan gort geslagen
3931777 als je het percentage omgekomenen in de jappenkampen afzet op de bevolking van nederland in de tweede wereldoorlog dan zouden er een miljoen mensen om het leven zijn gekomen
3931778 veel mensen in nederland weten nauwelijks wat daar gebeurd is in aanvang waren het geen vernietigingskampen maar door uithongering uitputting en ziektes werden de meeste kampen dat uiteindelijk wel als je het percentage omgekomenen in de jappenkampen afzet op de bevolking van nederland in de tweede wereldoorlog dan zouden er een miljoen mensen om het leven zijn gekomen
3931779 de nachten waren vreselijk ze zijn voor mij nog steeds een bezoeking
3931780 ik wil me eigenlijk niet overgeven aan de slaap de nacht is een soort beklemmende dreiging elke keer weer
3931781 de blik in de ogen van die nederlanders vergeet ik nooit meer ik heb de executie gelukkig niet gezien maar wel het geschreeuw gehoord die dag is mijn vertrouwen dat dingen goed gaan voorgoed verdwenen sindsdien leef ik met een onderstroom van een gevoel dat het onheil elk moment kan toeslaan
3931782 van hem kreeg ik lessen in scheepsbouwkunde met een takje in het zand want er was geen papier op een gegeven moment zei ingenieur de boer tegen me jan het gaat niet goed het eerste signaal van hongeroedeem was vocht in de benen dat kwam steeds hoger tot het bovenlijf bereikt was op een nacht kwam een non van de ziekenzaal me roepen de boer heeft naar je gevraagd want hij ligt op sterven
3931783 wat moest ik lezen het werd een gedeelte van het hogepriesterlijk gebed uit het johannes evangelie en de zogenoemde ziekentroost toen bedankte hij me de volgende ochtend was hij er niet meer zoiets op zon jeugdige leeftijd mee te maken had een grote impact op mij
3931784 de dood was altijd om je heen je wist vannacht gaan er weer mannen sterven dan stonden s ochtends hun namen op het bord
3931785 we kregen als corvee rs van de ziekenbarak een sterfschatting omdat er dan porties eten overbleven heel bizar eigenlijk
3931786 met twintig jongens werden we op een nacht naar het station gebracht om een trein schoon te maken waarin vrouwen en kinderen vanuit west java twee dagen onderweg waren geweest in die trein lagen nog resten veelal bedorven etenswaren we hebben daar ongelooflijk gulzig staan eten en onze zakken volgestopt maar op het perron moesten we die van een japanse officier legen we mochten n broodje houden
3931787 dat waren herenigingsreizen op eigen risico we zaten in een wagon met vrouwen en kinderen de eerste nacht sliepen we in het lege grand hotel in djokjakarta een japanse officier bewaakte ons tegen mogelijke aanvallers we proefden in djokja al onrust de volgende dag bij een tussenstop in tasikmalaja in de regio preanger hoorden we op het perron een ongelooflijk gejoel een paar honderd extremisten kwamen met gebalde vuisten en slag en steekwapens op de trein af het was een ontzettend dreigende situatie we wisten dat we van geen enkele kant hulp hoefden te verwachten is dit nou het einde dacht ik zal ik pijn voelen heb ik daarvoor zo lang gevangen gezeten de machinist ging gelukkig direct rijden daar ben ik hem nog altijd dankbaar voor
3931788 we hebben niet de illusie dat we de files helemaal kunnen oplossen maar slaag je erin om honderd mensen van de weg te halen dan heeft dat op de doorstroming toch al een klein effect we kunnen vertragingen bestrijden en alternatieven bieden waardoor een reiziger sneller of zonder oponthoud zijn doel bereikt
3931789 als we dit allemaal niet zouden doen zouden de files misschien nog langer zijn we halen de scherpe kantjes van de file door onnodige ergernissen te voorkomen
3931790 de capaciteit van de weg gaat omhoog wanneer autos minder van rijbaan wisselen
3931791 uit onderzoek blijkt dat de snelheid bij goed invoegen met zeker 5 kilometer omhoog kan
3931792 op knooppunt velperbroek is gebleken dat de file wel een half uur eerder begint op te lossen en de snelheid 10 km per uur hoger kan liggen
3931793 inmiddels zijn ruim 350 installaties doorgelicht met een gemiddelde verbetering van 30 procent verkeersstromen veranderen elk jaar met 5 procent dus moet je verkeerslichten geregeld opnieuw afstellen we hebben nog wel voor dertig manjaren aan werk liggen maar er zijn niet zoveel verkeerstechnici daarom hebben we er net 25 zelf opgeleid samen met de nationale hogeschool voor toerisme en verkeer we zijn nu met de tweede lichting bezig iedereen wordt er beter van in n jaar hebben we al 25 miljoen euro aan maatschappelijke baten door minder opstoppingen en ook de verkeersveiligheid is ermee gebaat je kunt mensen niet oneindig laten wachten want dan gaan ze door rood rijden
3931794 als deze proef succesvol blijkt en de eerste signalen wijzen daarop dan kunnen ernstige ongevallen veel sneller worden afgehandeld dat scheelt in de ontwrichtende onverwachte files die een paar keer per week in ons land voorkomen
3931795 veel mensen denken dat je op de politie moet wachten maar die speelt bij blikschade geen rol
3931796 we voeren deze campagne samen met de verzekeraars die een ingevuld schadeformulier nodig hebben dat kun je beter op een parkeerplaats invullen dan op straat voor eigen en andermans veiligheid maak de weg zo snel mogelijk vrij
3931797 het is de eerste proef van deze omvang in europa
3931798 vrachtwagens zijn maar bij 2 procent van alle ongevallen betrokken maar wel bij 15 procent van de dodelijke verkeersslachtoffers wat helemaal niet wil zeggen dat zij daarvan ook de veroorzakers zijn maar vrachtwagens zijn minder flexibel als ze plotseling moeten afremmen of uitwijken vergroot dat de kans op een ongeval dus geef ze de ruimte als een vrachtwagen kantelt is de ravage groot dan kunnen we tijd winnen door een hefkussen te gebruiken in plaats van een kraan dat gaat sneller er is minder afzetting nodig en de lading hoeft niet te worden overgeladen de helft van de nederlandse bergers zon 25 bedrijven werkt er al mee
3931799 zo zijn ze bij ongevallen en andere incidenten sneller ter plekke ook als de vluchtstrook in gebruik is als spitsstrook
3931800 om het verkeer bij wegafsluitingen zo effici nt mogelijk om te leiden worden vaste uitwijkroutes aangegeven met blauwe u borden indien nodig geeft een mobiel bord in de berm de aanwijzing om de uitwijkroute te volgen
3931801 sinds vorig jaar geven de dynamische route informatie panelen automobilisten in drukke verkeersgebieden zo extra informatie om goede keuzes te kunnen maken
3931802 als mensen eenmaal aan het openbaar vervoer gewend zijn blijft een deel van hen daarmee reizen
3931803 de files nemen er niet door af maar de bereikbaarheid van de binnenstad wordt wel beter en de waardering voor het openbaar vervoer neemt toe
3931804 voor recreatieverkeer is het doorgaans makkelijk om de file te vermijden als bijvoorbeeld op het bord bij burgers zoo nog een flink aantal kilometers rond arnhem staat aangegeven dan kunnen bezoekers besluiten om nog even te blijven de publiekstrekkers moeten zorgen voor een aantrekkelijk programma zo serveert burgers zoo een spitsmenu
3931805 alleen al met die twintig deelnemende winkeliers worden 6000 vrachtwagenritten per jaar uit de stad gehaald of verplaatst naar rustiger uren stel dat dit navolging vindt in alle grote steden dan levert dat merkbaar effect op ook op de snelweg
3931806 dat zie je ook in dichtbevolkte gebieden in de ons omringende landen waarmee we veel ervaringen uitwisselen groeiende mobiliteit hangt samen met welvaart er is zeer beperkte ruimte en een grote latente vraag als je een file hebt bestreden komt er vaak weer nieuw verkeer bij dus doen we n n n selectief wegen verbreden of aanleggen prijsbeleid hinderarm onderhoud noem maar op maatregelen op korte en langere termijn aan de aanbodkant maar ook gericht op de vraag naar mobiliteit
3931807 denk aan de mobiliteitskaart als alle bedrijven die invoeren en als de medewerkers voor zij op weg gaan zich informeren over de te verwachten reistijden dan maken we met zn allen slimmere keuzes soms de auto soms het ov soms een afspraak op een ander tijdstip of een andere locatie we blijven waar mogelijk uit de file en komen vaker op tijd aan daarmee wordt het mobiliteitsysteem betrouwbaarder
3931808 ill let you know up here which way it goes
3931809 okay i couldnt tell at first but im pretty sure that it goes counter clock wise
3931810 these matters would be dealt with as a health or education issue and involve the parents but now there is increasing pressure on judges and magistrates to be tough on this sort of thing and people are going to jail for consensual relationships between 18 and 15 year olds the girl gets pregnant the health service finds out and has to report it to the national indigenous violence and child abuse taskforce and then it ends up in court
3931811 their names go on a sex offenders register as pedophiles for at least 15 years which seriously hampers their ability to get work or move within and between states
3931812 there doesnt seem to be anyone saying we should have family meetings and getting health professionals involved there seems to be less scope now for dealing with these sorts of problems in a humane manner
3931813 seven police came into our house when people were sleeping and started pulling the blankets off everyone many of us including me are under medication im an asthmatic and epileptic but they just dragged me around like a dog
3931814 i said to them excuse me have some manners but they just sprayed mace right in my face and i had a fit they kicked me in the legs and the ribs and then dragged me to the paddy wagon chucked me in the back and took me down to the watch house
3931815 the aboriginal police officer verbally abused me he kept calling me an elephant and then they pepper sprayed me in the watch house yard they gave me a big spray in the eye i cried out for a doctor because it was burning but they didnt take any notice they were really crueling me
3931816 malaysiakini said it would reveal the identities of the commenters if it could however the cops raided and seized all their computers the only reason that may help in this case is to obtain correspondence between the commenter and rpk for example e mails as evidence for further investigation if not then the only thing rpk can give them is the internet protocol addresses and times which these addresses were logged onto his site the police can then cross reference this with the service provider for example tmnet to find out exactly which computer was logged on
3931817 this is akin to an invasion of privacy the complainant should point out specific comments for the court to decide if they are objectionable or would aid in an investigation
3931818 in any case reading an allegedly illegal article is not an offence
3931819 our lawyer recommended that the comment be removed but that the ip and time of comment be withheld unless they obtained a court order the company said it would do so but eventually we did not hear further

3931824 his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
3931825 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offence in cleveland
3931826 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
3931827 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back

3931844 i think the plantation stocks have fallen too much and tooquickly in recent weeks and we should see some rebound now
3931845 they have fallen pretty much every day in the last threeweeks and some recovery should be seen today though i thinkthe recovery may be temporary before the sector comes underpressure again
3931846 now that we have peace with god we should not have elements of war around us
3931847 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3931848 i know the polling i run will be often dismissed by outsiders as partisan polling anyway
3931849 so i wanted a nonpartisan pollster to combat that perception

3931851 i publish every poll i take even if they suck for democrats and a bunch have

3931884 the goal was to keep it to the historic period of the pier the feel of 1945 to 1960
3931885 its always a challenge for a commercial operator to come into a state park property where our mission is about education and being open to the public
3931886 the pier is built out over the water its made out of wood much like an old wooden boat the buildings are historic the buildings were not handicapped accessible but we understood the constraints preserving that historic character and authenticity of the pier is what differentiates the pier from a shopping mall in the valley
3931887 it was an elaborate and detailed design that very much looked like tile artwork at the adamson house
3931888 you want to come up with something that reflects the feel and the period but does not mimic historic features you dont want to fool people or create a false sense of history
3931889 the malibu pier is so beloved and iconic that we knew we were stewards of a very precious asset
3931890 that mistake made me realize that i need to have more confidence for the team final
3931891 i was awarded a second chance to compete in the final before the competition started i shouted twice to boost my confidence

3931897 i call it far and wide on account of the number of items it seemingly gets from as far away from england as possible
3931898 i grow my own vegetables so i know whats in season and i do get annoyed when theyve flown in veg from other parts of the world and its prices are absurdly high
3931899 perhaps it is inevitable that we might see some decline in demand among less deeply committed organic consumers but this is more likely to be a plateau than a reverse
3931900 it doesnt make sense to cut back on what it is a very economical way of eating especially on food where you know where it has come from and you can trust it
3931901 we have enthusiastic customers and i dont think that when the bank statement arrives they will take the organic veg box off their list i am fundamentally optimistic

3931907 i think that people were legitimately offended by some of the comments that he had made in the past
3931908 the fact that he is my former pastor i think makes it a legitimate political issue so i understand that
3931909 it is also true that to run a snippet of 30 second sound bites selecting out of a 30 year career simplified and caricatured him and caricatured the church and i think that was done in a fairly deliberate way

3931952 when we look at bank profitability we find that australian banks are around the top of the international range he said
3931953 on the surface this could indicate a lesser degree of competition than elsewhere
3931954 but when we look a bit deeper it seems that an important reason for the high profitability of australian banks is their unusually low bad debt experience
3931955 this has been the result of the very strong domestic economy he said
3931956 it is also worth noting that other australian industries have been very profitable over this period

3932032 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3932033 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese

3932229 apakah menurut kalian perempuan ini akan tega melemparkan anaknya ke dalam kobaran api
3932230 sungguh allah jauh lebih penyayang kepada hamba hamba nya daripada ibu ini kepada anaknya
3932231 sungguh allah telah memberikan anugerah kepada orang orang yang beriman yaitu ketika allah membangkitkan di antara mereka seorang rasul dari jenis mereka yang membacakan ayat ayat nya dan menyucikan jiwa mereka dan mengajarkan kepada mereka al kitab dan al hikmah padahal sebelumnya mereka berada di dalam kesesatan yang nyata
3932232 sesungguhnya tidak akan ada kehidupan bagi hati kesenangan dan ketenangan kecuali dengan mengenal rabbnya dan sesembahan yang menciptakan dirinya melalui nama nama sifat sifat dan perbuatan perbuatan nya
3932233 hai orang orang yang beriman penuhilah seruan allah dan rasul ketika ia menyeru kalian menuju sesuatu yang akan menghidupkan kalian dan ketahuilah sesungguhnya allah lah yang menghalangi seorang manusia dengan hatinya dan sesungguhnya kepda nya lah nanti mereka akan dikembalikan
3932234 apakah sama antara orang yang sudah mati orang kafir yang kemudian kami hidupkan dia dan kami berikan pancaran cahaya untuknya sehingga dia bisa berjalan di tengah tengah manusia dengan orang sepertinya yang tetap berada di tengah kegelapan serta tidak bisa keluar darinya
3932235 demikianlah kami telah mewahyukan kepadamu ruh dengan perintah kami sebelumnya kamu tidak mengerti apa itu al kitab dan apa itu iman namun kemudian kami menjadikannya sebagai cahaya yang memberikan petunjuk bagi siapa saja yang kami kehendaki di antara hamba hamba kami

3932239 demikian itulah barang siapa yang mengagungkan allah maka sesungguhnya itu terlahir dari ketakwaan hati

3932244 i think that we have the talent and the quality to get things done
3932245 i think its getting everybody on the same page and pointing them in the right direction
3932246 everyones got to come together and be that one group and take on anything that comes our way
3932247 the players dont have any excuses to begin with to be honest
3932248 when youre on that field if you hate the coach or love the coach you need to realize youre playing for your job through the years i think the mentality has been lost or has been shifted
3932249 before it was easier i followed the cobis of the world i followed the alexis of the world and if i didnt do it i knew id be gone
3932250 maybe i havent done a good enough job along with some of the older guys of helping along some of the younger guys gain that mentality but it starts in training
3932251 its on the players and it starts obviously with players like david landon myself chris klein some of the older players
3932252 to re create the magic the galaxy used to have theres no formula or everybody would do it
3932253 unfortunately weve fallen short our coach and our general manager took the hit for everybody in the end i think things will be revealed and it will become clear exactly what happened
3932254 but until then we have a game on thursday night and i guarantee you that philip anschutz is watching and tim leiweke is watching and if thats not motivation enough for this group i dont know

3932262 why giant malls which choke local businesses and encourage people to drive long distances to a single shopping destination are bad
3932263 the toll roads in the us were either brand new expensive as hell unused and going bankrupt or have wound up back in the public domain or with subsidies and regulation
3932264 joe public who has made the decision to get to the mall in his car based on real time info now finds 30 minutes later that it will cost 10 to use the mt wellington off ramp
3932265 i must confess i dont know whether the answer lies in corporate social responsibility or in some form of consumer immunisation program
3932266 i note hes keen to privatise the roads property paid for by our tax dollars and supposedly owned by all of us i guess being a man of principle mr darnton isnt planning to follow previous privatisers in first stealing our common property then flogging it to private interests
3932267 presumably he also objects to compulsory sales of peoples property by the state or the forced replacement of ownership with company shares as has been practised in the past
3932268 i assume then he will divide up the roads and give us each individual title to a chunk of them and leave us to negotiate with companies wanting to buy up the pieces
3932269 should anybody try and build a road anywhere near my property i shall sue
3932270 inevitably the judiciary and its bureaucracy will grow huge trying to keep up with the workload as individual lawsuits replace regulation but as mr darnton will have closed down most of the tax system this remnant of the state will collapse
3932271 i used to get quite a few stressed out people whose feet were bigger than the norm desperatly searching london for anything that would fit capitalism is good at providing choice providing your choice is the same as everybody elses
3932272 i also not that a subsidised road system is about the only thing that makes back block farms economic
3932273 the green movement and this blog are the hang outs for the worlds spoilt rich kids who will never experience a real problem in their lives and who have absolutely no idea of the reality that faces billions of people day after grinding day
3932274 like cities better but a good mall out in the burbs is usually more convenient than the trip to the city is
3932275 so why didnt you start up a shop catering to this demand
3932276 protest marches on parliament block traffic in wellington and no one calls that irresponsible behaviour which it isnt
3932277 like cities better but a good mall out in the burbs is usually more convenient than the trip to the city is
3932278 this is the same reason that student activism and demonstrations are so feared by despots these are spoilt rich kids who frequently change the world
3932279 so no i wont drive along in my consumerist bubble profiting on the slave labour of other countries i want to be an informed consumer at the very least
3932280 the fact we cant send them a bill for the lost productivity to the city as a whole eg delayed freight etc says a lot about how well the law can cope with irresponsible corporate as opposed to individual human behaviour
3932281 private vs public space public spaces in cities re also used for protests buskers street vendors performance art graffiti games and a whole host of human activities beyond shopping correct me if im wrong but i doubt youd get far trying any of those in sylvia park
3932282 transit acting regional manager peter spies said there were provisions in the building consent in case traffic became a problem and the developers would be expected to rectify it
3932283 being generous with other peoples money is a vice not a virtue
3932284 the real problem is that unrepresentative and often repressive regimes borrow the money yet the nation as a whole is deemed to have assumed the liability personally after such a regime has been ousted id like to see creditors have to pursue the dictators that they lent their money to and have no claim on the country itself
3932285 an informed consumer would understand that we are talking about free workers not slaves
3932286 the fact is that productivity in these economies is so low overall that a miserable pittance is the best they can pay themselves western companies are able to install reasonably productive plants in these low wage economies and so reap a significant profit as productivity increases in the economy generally so upward pressure on wages appears
3932287 i think the problem is that as part of the great western consumer society we are fooled into believing we need more than we actually do kiwis in particular seem to treat consumerism as a national past time this is not healthy either on a personal or national scale
3932288 i want three tombstones with our names all on them
3932289 because when my dad finds out that we saved you he is going to kill us all
3932290 good morning madam you dont know me but ive come to
3932291 thats what my husband and i had hoped please come in and have a seat just where do we start
3932292 leave everything to me i usually try two in the bathtub one on the couch and perhaps a couple on the bed sometimes the living room floor is fun too you can really spread out

3932302 we at ford see this years consumer shift to smaller vehicles as an opportunity and one that ford is uniquely positioned to answer using the strength of our european small car lineup and our fast moving global product plan
3932303 we plan to answer the call with dynamic fun to drive small cars and we intend to make them profitably
3932304 weve reduced the number of orderable combinations in north america including series packages and options by 90 percent for the ford brand alone in the 2008 2009 model years
3932305 if you look at the c segment focus will provide approximately 150 combinations by the 2010 model year more than a 95 percent reduction versus the 2008 model year

3932312 it could end up drawing more power because now the phone thinks its getting a worse signal than it actually is when it goes to talk to the network it speaks louder than it needs to

3932374 while the chairman can stack the deck with a board of directors and executive management team that looks more like a friends and family reunion than anything else should the irs determine that wwes contracted talent are employees and not independent contractors there is the potential for significant fines expenses and cost of doing business on a go forward basis that could have a serious negative impact on wwe stock
3932375 were seeing people bringing their own bags from home but a lot of people have also invested in our jute bags and we will be looking at extending this range
3932376 the feedback weve had from customers has been incredibly positive and such a dramatic drop in demand for plastic bags will help the national trust cut its waste and reduce the amount of rubbish ending up in landfill sites
3932377 the results are very low numbers compared to the hundreds of spores that are found in pools with more serious situations
3932378 however as a precaution we closed the pool and will super chlorinate it as a precaution
3932379 lobsters know when their shell is damaged and thats probably the reason when they have shell disease why they molt more quickly
3932380 but ultimately they still come down with the disease and we think the presence of alkyphenols contributes to that
3932381 plastics last a long time but breakdown products last even longer perhaps shell disease is only the tip of the iceberg of a more basic problem of endocrine disrupting chemicals in marine environments
3932382 in much of the united states in southern europe and in the populated regions of australia values far exceeding 40 celsius are reached
3932383 such temperatures if lasting for some days are life threatening and receive relatively little attention in the climate change debate
3932384 if the soil is drier then solar energy goes more to heating the air
3932385 in the mediterranean area we expect more southeasterly winds in summer that means more sun and less cloud

3932388 if an accord does not happen the government could take the initiative to build the two works through eletrobras
3932389 the brazilian government really wants to get these projects done because of concerns about potential power shortages
3932390 my sense of this is that both companies will defend their interests and you might have legal action but therell be some kind of agreement
3932391 wildlife managers are concerned that these snakes pose a danger to state and federally listed threatened and endangered species as well as to humans
3932392 several endangered species have already been found in the snakes stomachs
3932393 pythons could have even more significant environmental and economic consequences if they were to spread from florida to other states
3932394 although other factors such as type of food available and suitable shelter also play a role burmese pythons and other giant constrictor snakes have shown themselves to be highly adaptable to new environments
3932395 by using more complete climate data in this case 19 variables measuring climatic extremes averages and seasonal variation we can make more accurate predictions of species distributions
3932396 combining this climatic data with localities for the burmese python allows us to create powerful models for predicting suitable habitat for the snakes
3932397 the burmese python is strongly limited to the small area of suitable environmental conditions in the united states it currently inhabits due to the ecological niche preferences of the snake
3932398 global warming is predicted to significantly reduce the area of suitable habitat worldwide underscoring the potential negative effects of climate change for many species
3932399 this time around im just trying to forget about the glamour and all the things of the olympic games and just focus on running that one race on the track and thats the final
3932400 i want to get through all the rounds and when i get to the final just think of it as just another race and forget about what is going to happen after by just focusing on winning and executing properly
3932401 i dont want to go around saying what kind of time you expect but i believe that asafa has the goods this year to win the 100 metres
3932402 he is in excellent shape and i suspect that with the adjustments we have made this year to ensure that he is able to perform throughout the entire olympics then i think that hes going to show how good he really is
3932403 im just real confident a lot more determined a lot more focused on getting stuff done this year im more ready than ever
3932404 we can finish one two three in the 100m because michael frater running well and hes looking very confident
3932405 i would say the only chance anyone has of beating me in beijing is probably getting out in front of me thats the only chance anybody has of beating me right now
3932406 we are not perfect because we should have been practising from way back in april or january so right now we are kind of rushing things last minute
3932407 last year we did the same thing and messed up all the baton exchanges and ran 37 seconds this year we have a stronger team and we can win that final very easily if we dont mess up the exchanges that much
3932408 leadpoint is committed to helping brokers maximise their return from buying leads that is why we have teamed up with leading company lookuppage to offer every single one of our intermediaries a free webpage
3932409 with leadpoint when a consumer fills in a form online requesting to be contacted about a mortgage or a loan they will see a thank you page telling them who is going to contact them leadpoint lead buyers can already upload their logo and company information but now they can go one better by using the link to their free webpage they can show additional company information and pictures etc consumers can then click on their websites and see exactly who is going to be contacting them this will help build a relationship with the customer from the start ultimately this partnership should allow brokers to convert more leads into business
3932410 according to the london metro 72 of sole traders are not online and research by to pcp in nov 07 revealed that 32 of consumers search for professionals online before employing them these two factors alone should ensure that our partnership with lookuppage com will enable our lead buyers to generate more revenue from working with us in the current climate lead providers need to offer support and advice to help their customers maximise their return on investment this partnership is just one of a number of initiatives we have planned over the coming weeks to help our lead buyers get more from lead generation
3932411 as an online service based on making people visible in search there is a very clear opportunity to partner with an innovator like leadpoint our online reputation management service will provide a unique combination of an easily customisable web page highly visible across all leading search engines to help leadpoint intermediaries capture more sales leads

3932418 we are convinced that it is possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly
3932419 these products have been withdrawn by the retailers but there is a possibility that consumers may have them in their homes and so the retailers are recalling them from customers
3932420 it is imperative that all food businesses check the source of their ingredients and if it has originated from dawn farm foods plant number 734 they are strongly advised to check if they have used the products listed on the fsai website to withdraw these from sale and to contact the fsai with details
3932421 we anticipate net lending growth of approximately 15 for the full year we continue to control loan growth in the second half of the year and have adopted a very cautious and selective approach to new lending opportunities this strict lending policy will be maintained in 2009 with loan growth moderating further predicated on sustaining our strong balance sheet lending is currently attracting increased margins and we expect this re pricing to continue
3932422 even allowing for a lending impairment charge in line with the 2009 market consensus of 0 7 some four to five times the anticipated current year level and above management expectations the bank would remain highly profitable and capital accretive in 2009 as virtually all lending is secured by tangible collateral our total provisions comfortably exceed our net exposure to impaired loans
3932423 anglo irish bank will report another very good performance in 2008 we will invest further in our funding franchises and these actions will serve to protect and enhance the banks strong balance sheet and position us well for when markets begin to recover
3932424 the provision of additional quota will allow existing producers to expand and should also encourage new entrants into the sector
3932425 the plan was my departments response to the target in the programme for government for 5 of the land area to be under organic production by 2012
3932426 one of the specific actions in the plan was to facilitate the expansion of the organic dairy sector by allocating additional quota and i am pleased that we are able to deliver on this so soon

3932431 every hour that academics spend on administration and seeking external research funding is an hour lost to teaching students the core funding of universities is only rising 2 5 this year but it should be going up at least 6 if were to provide the same services as last year

3932448 these preliminary figures for june show that the uk hotel industry continues to remain steady in 2008
3932449 there has been a slight decrease in the occupancy figures for some cities this month but the beginning of the summer holiday season goes some way towards explaining this
3932450 it should also be noted that the decreases are very small and as 2007 was such a strong year slight decreases are not a major concern particularly as the rooms yield year to date figures for both london and the regions are so far higher than the same period in 2007

3932453 there is going to be a huge increase in online travel and many global players have recognised the economic potential of the market as well as the importance of maintaining service quality
3932454 it technology provides them not only with a competitive edge but also helps to protect their assets brand equity and drives innovation
3932455 in a world which is literally run by technology it is imperative that one sustains the growth and invests intelligently to generate better yields and revenue
3932456 most successful travel companies now embrace innovative technology solutions and online sales
3932457 our role is to convene a great travel trade event that shows exhibitors and travel buyers how to get their share of the future of travel
3932458 win tickets to see zebrahead at house of blues anaheim
3932459 the hospitality industry needs to understand that with this legislation they better get ready for union activity at all hotels not just big brand name ones even the holiday inn express in waco kansas needs to be prepared to be unionized if this goes through
3932460 this then has a negative effect on new investment so i do not see these events contributing to a growth in online distribution
3932461 consumers are much more reluctant to pay directly online it is also a restricted market protecting local companies and this restricts the introduction of foreign advanced technologies or innovative foreign disruptive technology in the next few years the business2business environment will be firmly engaged in online distribution and procurement of product the most significant change will be in the way hotel product in china is distributed
3932462 the trouble that some travel companies and hotels find themselves in due to the slowdown will drive consolidation and alliances in the months to come which will have an impact on the sector
3932463 hopefully hotels will learn from the experience of the olympics not to rely on large scale events and inflated rates but to follow a path of smart distribution strategy through multiple channels and multiple markets more otas and online consolidators are entering as enabling technology becomes more accessible and cheaper for chinese hotels
3932464 the gds market will have to be regulated although i do not believe the government will relinquish complete control more likely they will announce further alliances with major international gds to provide new technology and further inventory for travelsky the chinese monopoly gds more airline consolidation is also expected in china as airlines lose money on rising fuel costs
3932465 i think we will see mergers and acquisitions happening early in 2009 i also believe that the chinese government will announce further relaxation of protective regulation in the sector to boost the industry post olympics
3932466 the long supposed correlation between employment growth and hotel demand can in fact be quantified
3932467 and we are able via the index to calculate a reliable ratio of room nights generated per new job created in a market our test case was the washington d c market where employment trends office occupancies and hotel performance are consistently strong but the index can be adapted to analyze hotel demand in most primary and secondary markets in the u s

3932476 the situation is that kerry asked for an interpretation of a rule from croke park which we didnt want to give because its not our job to do that but having lined out i understand he trained earlier this week kerry have now been informed today in writing by the ard sti rth ir that it is his belief and my belief that its contrary to rule and hes been told not to train with kerry
3932477 what happened happened and were not going to revisit that situation

3932530 this is an example of what this city and its officials are all too willing to do to keep damaging information from coming forward
3932531 i saw a large crowd in the foyer of detroit receiving hospital a lot of hustling of people into private rooms a couple of other suvs pull up black dark windows and they go into the hospital and told us to keep the driveway clear
3932532 it became apparent it was the mayors executive protection unit they did not allow me access to the hospital
3932533 we dont want to disrupt the hearing because the room is full
3932534 i feel i was threatened because they reminded me that i was a city employee

3932537 the english landscape and knights on horseback dressed in their heraldric colours were one of the first things i remember loving as a child
3932538 and when i realised i could write stories of my own a knight story was at the top of the list
3932539 i was channel surfing one evening and i happened upon a performance by a group called celtic woman it was just in time to hear one of the women sing a song called the soft goodbye it is probably one of the most beautiful songs i have ever heard and it struck me immediately as the perfect foundation for the story my creativity is often triggered by music casting crowns bebo norman jim byrnes selections from creeds weathered and other songs also helped me to naturally figure out the main characters whys and wheretofors
3932540 there are so many great artists out there like paul jake and amanda and the team working on my wifes shadow of the stars comic series they all deserve to be seen even if we could contract any artist in the industry and there are a handful we hope to work with we are thrilled to help aspiring artists working to get a foothold afterall it is these artists who are helping us to achieve our initial publishing goals and words cannot describe our gratitude we are all together in this
3932541 i think somethings wrong with these burgers they dont smell very good
3932542 i always had a fascination with angels and mythology especially nordic and egyptian i spent a lot of time wondering what it would be like if those two groups interacted and fought over some unknown part of the universe
3932543 the idea actually started with a fan fiction i was writing based on a japanese anime show about soccer that was popular in germany
3932544 all of a sudden the characters from that fan fiction meshed with my deep interest in angels and mythology and everything else i was watching on tv and reading
3932545 at the heart of the story is redemption and the price that comes with it
3932546 that and the power of friendship and self sacrifice i know that these themes are not new in storytelling and i dont think that they should ever stop being told the only thing that changes is the presentation of communicating these age old virtues and the ways that authours balance the adventure with the deeper meanings of the story to keep things fresh for the community of readers
3932547 thats been the focus of my whole summer the green bay packers
3932548 theyre going through all that as a team trying to figure out if favre or aaron rodgers was the man while weve got the same team we had all offseason im glad they got all that darn press cause when we go down there itll be the kids first start and his first damn loss
3932549 i was basically having fun with it because we played pretty bad and got embarrassed
3932550 they beat us 34 0 that was the only running back that got 100 yards on us so were just having fun with it but were serious with it too its just reading material theyve got all this negative stuff going on with the news about everything else in the world so we just want to have fun
3932551 that aint going to happen monday night in the opener
3932552 trust me it aint going to happen ive got everybody focused
3932553 i dont know that i necessarily value judge who it is saying things
3932554 i know when i think it doesnt look right some people you can tell hey dont do that and some people you let go you dont want anything too outrageous im not a bulletin board guy you let your play do the speaking for itself by and large id say thats the way i approach it i havent talked to pat about it
3932555 obviously the first game as you go out there you learn a few things i thought we did a nice job with that

3932588 oh wow everyone is completely out of socks and underwear
3932589 now gero took a shower this morning so if i dont use extremely hot water on these dishes i can get a shower tonight
3932590 in regards to the male diet i firmly believe that the most important element is total calories consumed
3932591 i then stopped dieting except still no ice cream or sweet tea but i kept running five or six days a week i found that i could maintain my weight just by eating sensibly as long as i continued to regularly run
3932592 if its drudgery find another form of smart eating and exercise thats more fun or at least not totally a drag
3932593 eighteen percent more food energy is required in many populations where there is a large prevalence of obesity
3932594 there is a clear impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions in order to grow that food
3932595 more transportation fuel energy will be used to transport the increased mass of the obese population which will increase even further if as is likely the overweight people in response to their increased body mass choose to walk less and drive more
3932596 as the population is becoming heavier more food energy is required in order to maintain that mass
3932597 this is not pointing the finger at people with a bmi body mass index over 30 i think that the population has the responsibility to be aware that we are seriously impacting greenhouse gas emission by our weight these are basic physics equations
3932598 quit rocking on that stool keep four on the floor or else youre gonna fall over and smack your head or your chin on the granite counter top and then youll fall and start crying and its going to be nobodys fault but your own and im just gonna stand here looking at you and i promise you i wont do a thing no thats not true ill do something ill stand there and laugh at you and then ill say i told you so i told you a million and twelve times not to rock on that stool and to keep all the legs of the chair on the floor
3932599 fear leads to hate hate leads to anger anger leads to suffering
3932600 we would really like to see nutrition applied in daily life
3932601 people who succeed and lose weight and keep it off eat very very differently
3932602 is not risk free and i think its really important for all people women and men to know about the risks and to be very clear about what theyre getting into
3932603 im looking forward to having more races as is planned for the future
3932604 though i wouldnt mind missing one or two tests actually the tests have been reduced quite a lot over the last two or three years but i hope we have more races because there is not one that i dont like
3932605 im looking forward to going to india and the other interesting new places currently being discussed
3932606 i think its a pity because for me formula 1 being a world championship should race everywhere in the world but i think theres a good chance we will go to the states in the future
3932607 with spore were looking way outside the game space such as tv movies etc were basically planting the seeds to spread spore out to a much wider group of people than would ever play a computer game
3932608 were going to be much more intelligent about harvesting other market opportunities for spore than we were with the sims which as big as it was in the game space pretty much remains in the game space longer term i think the brand of spore potentially has a wider net to cast than the sims did
3932609 lets see if weve got this right parlaying a 23 and 33 record after mav took over into something special is the reason for announcing his continuation as coach
3932610 it takes a lot of b s to tell the loyal paying fans and a community that just spent 40 million plus on a new arena that after 8 years of failure that they should be satisfied with a coach with a winning percentage of 410 because you think that is a positive move forward
3932611 i have been a season ticket holder for the past 8 years but i have not renewed yet because i wanted to see the direction the team would be heading this season thank you mr springer as you have helped me make my decision
3932612 i will not be renewing i will be placing my order for bulls season tickets today
3932613 i have spoken with at least a dozen fronts players and they would all love to see mavety replaced they think he is a nice guy but they feel there are better coaches out there
3932614 this club will remain an absolute joke for as long as doug springer owns the club he doesnt care about winning or having a successful hockey club he just cares about money and the fact he retained mavety instead of bringing in someone who can truly turn this team around confirms this
3932615 confirmed mav back behind the bench in kingston also confirmed disgruntled fronts fans walking away shaking their heads in disgust
3932616 doug springer you are an utter embarrassment to junior hockey and do us all a favour and make the rumour the truth sell the team to someone who cares more about the team than they do about lining their pockets and keeping old friends employed
3932617 how do you feel about this fronts fans good or bad move you cant honestly be serious when asking that
3932618 no way the kids wanted him back at least not the ones pursuing hockey as their livelihood
3932619 just when you think it cant get worse doug and mav always come through
3932620 now that kingston taxpayers are subsidizing the hockey team the current owners should take their profits and sell the team to someone who has a clue
3932621 after this latest slap in the face to the citizens and hockey fans of kingston mayor

3932646 no se puede planificar el desarrollo forestal argentino si no existen f bricas de pasta celulosica stas forman parte de toda la cadena de producci n
3932647 por ello el r gimen de promoci n de bosques cultivados debe sostenerse e incluso incrementarse en los pr ximos a os
3932648 esto es el fruto del trabajo en consenso que se viene realizando con todas las provincias del pa s y tambi n es una muestra que estamos en buen camino para alcanzar la pr rroga de la ley
3932649 empresarios productores profesionales y funcionarios provinciales y nacionales se encolumnaron bajo un solo objetivo resignando incluso algunas posturas en pos de alcanzar la continuidad del sistema y alcanzar los objetivos propuestos incrementar la masa forestal de argentina

3932661 i learned a lot we had good times we had bad times but at the moment i am very happy with mclaren the atmosphere here is very good
3932662 now we can just focus on racing and getting good results we dont need to talk about contracts

3932667 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
3932668 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio

3932670 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado
3932671 lo que proponemos como alternativa es que la carretera pueda pasar por otra v a
3932672 nosotros no estamos en contra del camino porque es necesario pero queremos que se respeten los lugares sagrados
3932673 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
3932674 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
3932675 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
3932676 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
3932677 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
3932678 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
3932679 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
3932680 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
3932681 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge

3932691 llevar tiempo y esfuerzo para recuperar la capacidad de los peque os agricultores y no parece que haya ning n deseo pol tico para esto sin olvidar el hecho que nafta debe ser renegociada
3932692 in til buscar un programa de recuperaci n que sea consistente con el pago de la deuda fijada por nuestros acreedores
3932693 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
3932694 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
3932695 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
3932696 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
3932697 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
3932698 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas
3932699 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3932700 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3932701 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3932702 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3932703 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3932704 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3932705 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3932706 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3932707 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3932708 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3932709 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3932710 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3932711 all in all it was another good day and we got a lot done
3932712 he definitely is a force inside when hes back out there
3932713 el mayor golpe a la globalizaci n desde el fin de la guerra fr a
3932714 instalado una situaci n donde la furia del campesinado podr a poner en peligro el equilibrio pol tico y aun la estructura misma
3932715 exportaciones de china representan 40 de su producto interno bruto y queda claro que los pol ticos en pek n y nueva delhi temen una desaceleraci n que cierre las f bricas reduzca las v lvulas de escape de la migraci n a las ciudades transformando al migrante rural en un integrante potencial de una turba
3932716 en las ltimas d cadas la apertura de los mercados y la creciente interdependencia econ mica ha sido una fuerza de estabilidad geopol tica as como de creciente bienestar econ mico para los m s pobres del mundo
3932717 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3932718 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3932719 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3932720 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3932721 i think all things are related to another cause the energy forms are all the same in the physics of our solar system and beyond
3932722 im just here to spread the word however i can
3932723 i think my favorite part of this all is the
3932724 madonnas representatives have been visiting the girl the adoption is now advanced
3932725 then mercy will be able to leave the country for a new life
3932726 i dont know how official the malawian offical can be because there are no plans for madonna to adopt another child from malawi
3932727 she is getting ready to start her tour in l0 days
3932728 i heard this same rumor a year ago i dont know why its back because it simply isnt true
3932729 i was supposed to be in the pilot and then i had stella daughter when they went back into production so it didnt work out but im hoping to return later in the season
3932730 because i get to differentiate between a boy and a girl at seven weeks stella already has a much different personality than liam and just seeing them bond together is so amazing it takes your life to a different level
3932731 we would like more but i think well take a break enjoy the ones we have now and enjoy each other and the family unit
3932732 but in the future it would be nice to have more
3932733 stori telling was kind of stories about my life growing up and now its kids lives growing up and me being a mom being in the craziness of hollywood and dealing with that
3932734 if you are not failing every now and then its a sign that youre not doing anything innovative
3932735 i love malaysia and im so happy to be back when i first set foot here i was bowled over by peoples kindness and helpfulness
3932736 i wish the world could be more like malaysia everyone i meet is polite and courteous and i like the diversity here
3932737 i meet up with jerry occasionally and host his tribute shows hes in his 80s yet he has the physique of a man in his late 30s
3932738 there are 47 theatres here and lots of live acts its a very small town with about 8 000 people yet it receives seven million visitors a year
3932739 what motivates me most is my fans they always inspire me to do my best in music and television
3932740 most of the all time favourite hits were penned or composed in those decades
3932741 many of the budding singers and songwriters are simply great and i meet and motivate them at times i plan to collaborate with some of them soon
3932742 therell be about 15 songs a blend of old and new timeless tunes
3932743 as for the upcoming duet album this show is a preview of whats in store
3932744 after so many meetings the indonesians have figured out how to play us if before they would attack just one player today yesterday they attacked us both they were also very agile and their court movement made it very difficult for us to kill the shuttle
3932745 we were chasing for most of the game and this made it very difficult they kept surging ahead and that put us under pressure
3932746 i dont know why i couldnt finish the game and force the decider lu lan was tiring and i had my chances but somehow my head and hand were just not coordinating and i kept letting her back into the match
3932747 when it comes to finding a life partner nothing beats the human touch and people prefer to place their trust in a person rather than a computer
3932748 its a trade secret but we do have our ways and means of verifying any information provided
3932749 the success rate is higher compared to the internet because the person doing the matching has a good understanding of both candidates it takes a human to understand another human technology cant pull that off
3932750 i convinced them to give it a try and now theyre happily married thats what i mean by the human touch in computer matching candidates are immediately dismissed if certain requirements arent there but relationships cannot work on that basis
3932751 we have models and actresses and even a miss malaysia finalist in our files beauty or the lack of it has nothing to do with it people have the same needs they want to meet their life partners and need help
3932752 ive always been active in issues related to women and children but right now im in a position where i can make changes being in the drivers seat so to speak
3932753 i couldnt just go there and say come i have something to say people wont come i had to have an organised platform to do so and mca became that platform they organised these health programmes and i gave the talks and thats how i became an mca member
3932754 i came home from school and found all these presents on the dining table and was informed that a family in the neighbourhood who had a bicycle repair shop had asked for my hand my father wanted me to get married because he felt there was nothing else for me to do after form five
3932755 my mother is a very strong character if she had been weak or hadnt stood up for what she believed in my life would have been so different she changed my destiny
3932756 i always tell young women that in lifes journey there are so many different roles and whatever role youve been given play it well
3932757 if we fail then we must say we have failed i do not want to hear excuses like we fought valiantly but lost the public doesnt want to hear that and neither will the public be happy with just a bronze or silver
3932758 what they desire is gold and we have to accept that given the amount that has been spent on preparing the athletes
3932759 this would mean that there are still aspects that we need to improve on for one our penetration into sports science is still not at the level it should be
3932760 at the moment only athletes who are in the national sports councils programme are benefiting from sports science we need to start educating athletes much earlier we have several satellite centres but we need to reach more and for this to happen the government has no choice but to spend money
3932761 we must also start paying more attention to olympic sports and what is planned is a biennial games catering to selected olympic sports the malaysia games will not be touched and will continue as it is with our version of the mini olympics being held every alternate year
3932762 there are so many areas that we have to improve on as our athletes are lagging in so many sports we came to beijing with a realistic chance of a medal only in badminton and an outside chance in archery and cycling
3932763 while i am not condoning poor finishes we have to accept that this is our standard and we have to improve
3932764 i want to take it one match at a time i have watched sonys matches here on tape and will strategise accordingly the world championships defeat is in the past what matters now is this match and i will go on court with the same approach minimal mistakes
3932765 they can consume kilogrammes of grass once it is shredded
3932766 thats their lunch and dinner for breakfast they have specially manufactured pellets
3932767 our children come up during the weekends to enjoy hikes and the outdoors
3932768 we learnt how to look after the goats make fertilisers out of their manure and identify diseases that plague them
3932769 in fact we are still learning many things about goat farming
3932770 we have a barter system with them during the harvest season we collect their corn and oil palm fronds as feed for our goats in return villagers can opt for our goat milk or meat sometimes we find a basket of durians deposited at our front gate theyre so generous
3932771 we pay between rm7 000 and rm8 000 per month for salaries feed and the like it will take another five or six years before we see any returns once we become a bigger farm 1 000 goats we figure we can reap profits from rm5 000 to rm6 000 per month
3932772 we had local goats in the beginning but they needed to roam around a lot with the result that quite a few go missing from time to time
3932773 there are the stubborn ones and ones prone to be bullied for example
3932774 we get requests from the local hospital we never charge them and thats when durians appear at our doorstep
3932775 dividing our time between here and kl is a bit of a challenge although we have got used to it the rising cost of pellets is another concern
3932776 working the land they say keeps one honest and humble
3932777 online games and online advertising are two industries growing rapidly theyre riding on that trend
3932778 given the economy in china is slowing down and its effect may become more obvious after the olympics event
3932779 you need guys to shut people down out there and thats what he does
3932780 and the best thing is hed be there first to say hes got room for improvement
3932781 we all have an ego but he keeps his ego in check he cares about the team hes a hard worker hes the first one in line for all of our drills he tries to do it exactly like you ask him to do it hes humble hes hardworking hes just just everything you would want
3932782 and its time to go make plays on the ball
3932783 he went out in his contract year and had an excellent year
3932784 and were fortunate to sign him to a long term deal here which hopefully means he ends his career here that is sort of the right thing you know hes a local kid played at wazzu to play your whole career in the state of washington is pretty unique
3932785 i feel established but yet at the same time im working hard ive got to get better
3932786 id like to do the same guess that makes me a dyke
3932787 we havent had word yet how it will impact us
3932788 the tax rates that the school district can levy are established by the department of education through a somewhat complicated formula that takes into account a base estimate of what it costs to educate a student certain adjustments for rural issues cost of living considerations and the number of exceptional education students
3932789 we cannot just raise taxes to make up for a decline in property values
3932790 they the state give us a number what were going to receive from them and thats how we will build our budget
3932791 they may come back during the school year and decide to cut and well have to make reductions to make it work
3932792 it would be in non direct functions thats for sure
3932793 cutting in schools and classrooms would be the last place wed look

3932797 philippine areas incontent mediumrectangle300 2twenty three individuals from a village in la trinidad were hospitalized due to a diarrhea outbreak in their area the benguet provincial health office pho said
3932798 i want to first of all express my condolences to the families of these murdered humanitarian workers
3932799 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country
3932800 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3932801 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
3932802 they called and i didnt really quite believe it i was hoping i was still asleep and it was a dream but it was for real
3932803 im sure she wouldnt have gone into that situation if she had known nothings worth that
3932804 shes made a huge difference in the world already but i think its just a tragedy a stupid waste that she should be brought to a halt so violently and so soon she had so much that she was offering people
3932805 in the last two three years she travelled at least half a year maybe more and to many different countries her suitcase was sort of installed at the top of the stairs always being unpacked or repacked or en route
3932806 she knew what she wanted she would work hard to get it she didnt suffer fools gladly she had a mission and she took it very seriously she had a huge smile she really loved life she loved travelling she loved seeing different countries
3932807 ive spoken with staff in afghanistan she was terribly well regarded very very well regarded by the staff and by the afghan community as i understand it
3932808 she was very hard working utterly compassionate and committed to her work a real believer in humanitarian assistance
3932809 she was a smart committed talented young woman who went to a difficult part of the world where the needs are extensive to apply the skills that she had acquired over the years in her education and professional experience
3932810 she was courageous compassionate lovely brave hard working and utterly committed to what she was doing
3932811 she was very very good at her work she really was as good as it gets as a humanitarian worker and as an individual and we are heartbroken and utterly grief stricken by her loss
3932812 her energy cheerfulness generosity and critical mind will be sorely missed by her colleagues in education and the feminist community at mcgill
3932813 knowing the risks associated with working in a conflict zone these humanitarian aid workers gave selflessly to help improve the lives of the afghan people
3932814 their spirits will live on in the continued efforts of all who are assisting in the reconstruction of afghanistan

3932818 i drove the ball really well off the tee also to be honest i missed a few fairways but when i did i made a few birdies even from the rough i am just comfortable at this place
3932819 it is an honor to represent your country and junior golf and play with the best and against the best from europe
3932820 if i can hit the fairways on this course which is not easy to do i can score
3932821 i love playing in this championship and i also have a goal of making this years junior ryder cup team no matter what
3932822 i shot a good score today and i really put a lot of good swings on the ball but i want to go out tomorrow and forget about it and keep it going for all four rounds
3932823 i want to walk away from this week and feel good about my game
3932824 i am playing pretty confident i have been playing for five weeks straight this summer and this is my sixth week in a row and each week i seem to be getting better
3932825 i hit some really close approach shots which boosted my confidence out there today
3932826 my putting on the front nine was bad there were some easy holes that i could have birdied and i did not
3932827 i started to putt better on my back nine and just hit the ball better overall i am confident going into the weekend and i am going to try and shoot under par the rest of the week
3932828 people can make methamphetamines with very basic easily acquired ingredients
3932829 we have had success but policing against this drug is the biggest challenge we have ever faced because you can buy ingredients at a shop and make it in a small place
3932830 cambodia is very proud of its achievements but no country can fight this alone
3932831 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers
3932832 our responsibility is to make sure that we create a law that regardless of the technology includes a set of legal guarantees that consumers have with respect to their information
3932833 this is a book that combines the wiliness of george saunders and the wisdom of ron carlson put simply this is a great collection
3932834 they are staying there to neutralize the large arsenal of weapons and other military hardware in the areas of gori and senaki these arsenals remain unguarded apparently those who guarded them fled
3932835 aimed at ensuring the peace enforcement operation in respect to the georgian side which violates all of its obligations
3932836 russian tanks continue to ravage georgia town and villages killing people destroying buildings looting theyve been doing worse things to what ive heard in the past and i could never imagine happening in my country
3932837 we as the russian federation are sticking to the agreement which has been made in moscow yesterday and we hope that the other side will show its readiness to do the same
3932838 blaming again us for doing something which is contrary to the real situation
3932839 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
3932840 there is no cease fire russian forces are moving around
3932841 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
3932842 almost exactly four years after that campaign against sen john kerry began mr corsi has released a new attack book painting senator barack obama the democrats presumed presidential nominee as a stealth radical liberal who has tried to cover up extensive connections to islam mr obama is christian and questioning whether his admitted experimentation with drugs in high school and college ever ceased
3932843 significant parts of the book whose subtitle is leftist politics and the cult of personality have already been challenged as misleading or false in the days since its debut on aug 1 nonetheless it is to make its first appearance on the new york times best seller list for nonfiction hardcovers this sunday at no 1
3932844 mr obamas campaign has yet to weigh in heavily on mr corsis accusations it appears to face the classic decision between the risk of publicizing the books claims by addressing them and the risk of letting them sink into the public debate with no response
3932845 there will be no book coming in october because rev wright has not written a new book
3932846 clintons campaign never did quite become the flag waving patriotic operation that penn envisioned in march 2007 nor did she ever go as overtly negative as he was preaching in march and april 2008 would she be the nominee if she had and can mccain win the presidency if he carefully pursues a similar path
3932847 mccain risks damaging his reputation as a politician who has eschewed the politics of negativity
3932848 but what was considered out of bounds in a democratic primary campaign may be less so in a general election race in which other voters come into play mccain will have to make some difficult judgments about this in the final 82 days
3932849 its fair to say that most people thought it would really rebound on her
3932850 the focus on warner could help boost his prospects in virginia where he is trying to win an open senate seat and obama is also campaigning hard
3932851 now theyve made barrys convention all about them their dissatisfaction and revisionism and barely disguised desire to see him fail whatever insincere words of support the clintons muster their primal scream gets louder he cant win he cant close the deal we told you so
3932852 hillarys orchestrating a play within the play in denver just as hamlet used the device to show that his stepfather murdered his father hillary will try to show the democrats they chose the wrong savior
3932853 what we want if we still can is to save the democratic party from itself
3932854 seeing the two different john mccains is a fracture in his credibility
3932855 their reasons for crossing party lines are diverse ranging from the war in iraq to overspending in washington and signal unhappiness not just with the candidacy of republican sen john mccain but with the republican party as a whole
3932856 how come modern sports especially womens sports involve the exposure of private parts it is well known that the olympics both in the past and the upcoming games the worlds worst display of womens clothing is the womens olympics no exposure of womens private parts on a global scale could make satan happier than olympic games that include womens sports
3932857 one of these criminals compared a soccer team that made it to the top in asia and traveled to spain to the conquest of andalusia
3932858 many people nowadays watch sports rather than participate in them
3932859 if only they would run or move their bodies a little all they do is sit and watch the sports channels
3932860 wrestling involves the exposure of womens private parts even the promotion of the competitions is done by scantily clad women this is done at the beginning of the match in the middle and at the end or so i hear the matches are promoted by half naked women
3932861 the sport of yoga was originally a hindu game used for divine worship for them practicing yoga is a means of divine worship whoever practices yoga today is emulating their form of worship
3932862 beijing or not i call it bikini anyway because they are likely to display women in the worst possible way in these bikini olympic games
3932863 what women wear in the olympic games are among the worst clothes possible
3932864 and maybe the mens clothing is more modest than the womens

3932866 final declaration of the yale common word conference july 2008
3932867 it seems that the implications of this verse were not realized or discussed
3932868 this is a step towards affirming that muhammad is a prophet and the quran a word of god
3932869 as christians we affirm that the promises of abraham are fulfilled in christ
3932870 no muslim or christian should tolerate the denigration or desecration of one anothers sacred symbols founding figures or places of worship
3932871 we raise these issues because of our concern for the biblical christian faith and for the implications of the common word process for christian minorities in muslim lands christian mission in muslim lands and converts from islam to christianity around the world
3932872 although we respect and love muslims christians cannot accept islam as an equal and valid revelation from god the denial of the deity of christ and his redemptive work as well as of the trinity will always stand in the way of interfaith dialogue and co operation
3932873 just as muslims cannot accept the christian denial of muhammads prophethood and the qurans status as the word of god so christians must take a clear stand on the central doctrines of their faith
3932874 fully affirm s and support s all endeavors to work for peace in this torn world

3932880 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3932881 thats okay with us we dont need the games anymore as we found a real war to practice in
3932882 if he doesnt understand the situation well have to go further
3932883 he doesnt seem to understand that the russian army is much stronger than the georgian army his tanks remain in their places his air force is dead his navy is also his army is demoralized
3932884 if the russian government continues to claim that 2 000 people were killed as the result of the conflict its time to provide some evidence its time to provide some data name age gender the circumstances of death

3932888 at the moment any it company any outsourcer or any bpo firm that can go in there and say to a company we can save your money not only that but we can save you money this financial year is doing very well
3932889 but any technology company which is dependent on discretionary spend i believe that their outlook statements are looking much less healthy than they were a year ago or even six months ago
3932890 but the real problem with technology is not in the first six months of this year maybe is not going to come in even the second half of this year but i really do believe that 2009 could be the year when all of this finally catches up with the technology sector
3932891 some areas will grow dramatically some areas unfortunately will see some fairly major declines in revenues but the average is
3932892 going to see a very minor but significant negative for 2009
3932893 cash and i have been glued to the olympics how amazing was the opening ceremony i still dont know how they co ordinated 2008 people to move in perfect sync
3932894 we have seen a great opportunity for thai financial institutions to benefit from open solutions banking solutions
3932895 with an open architecture platform our clients and prospects will become more diverse and better able to establish themselves as universal and retail banking providers
3932896 we continue to look for advanced and innovative technology that offers our clients the highest level of operational success
3932897 we are confident this partnership with open solutions will allow us to better serve the needs of financial institutions in thailand and we look forward to working with them
3932898 as we continue our strong efforts to increase our international presence we are pleased to partner with mst the asian market is very important to us and we look forward to providing our solutions to thai financial institutions
3932899 we have a dedicated team in place to expand our presence within the international marketplace our partnership with mst further demonstrates our dedication to addressing the demand for our technology within the asian marketplace
3932900 in my travels overseas specifically in asia i have found that asian financial institutions are interested in the types of innovative banking solutions that open solutions has developed a market reputation for and our partnership with mst will provide these institutions with greater

3932904 i think this is an argument the coup leaders are making to justify themselves and what they did but it doesnt conform to reality
3932905 i havent been asked anything i dont know anything about it hes supposed to be in court friday
3932906 i said no travel the last time he was in my court
3932907 after the events of the past six days no one should wonder why countries on russias periphery so ardently seek the security guarantees alliance membership represents
3932908 the situation is still unstable and russia must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words
3932909 the united states should now join our european partners in direct high level diplomacy with both georgia and russia to seek immediate implementation of a cease fire and to achieve a lasting resolution to this crisis
3932910 for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict
3932911 i know the people of georgia have enjoyed an unprecedented period of prosperity and freedom and i know that at this time theyre suffering mightily
3932912 so maybe later on in the campaign lets have a back and forth about who has comments or statements now lets devote all our energy to helping resolve a situation which is fraught with human tragedy
3932913 theres a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience that doesnt compare between the two on russia policy
3932914 you cant compare a 15 year historical record to three or four statements over the course of 15 months
3932915 we cannot act on the basis of ideology or preconceived notions when this crisis began barack obama the administration and all of our nato allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them
3932916 some voters may worry does he want to start a new cold war the risk for mccain is that he could overplay the issue and frighten war weary voters whose priorities right now lie closer to home

3932926 we had a little bit of luck on our side with the helicopter being where it was and the fact that the dive team was out practicing that day

3932968 it would not be right to talk about these things
3932969 threat to the whole world order and there are many actions to be made in the realm of intelligence and preventive measures
3932970 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
3932971 israel supports international efforts to place pressure on the regime in tehran to cease nuclear enrichment its time for the international community to send a clear message to the iranian leadership only if diplomacy is exercised seriously will diplomacy succeed
3932972 the american military has made clear it doesnt want israeli military action at this time
3932973 the reverse funnel system is the only system you need

3932978 but there is show of evidence that it may be an early warning for more violent behavior

3932980 if you are involved in something that goes wrong never blame others blame no other but yourself
3932981 until i hear anything else thats the way im looking at it right now
3932982 im focusing on football until i hear anything else ill assume its over
3932983 no matter what anybody says theres going to be people who automatically assume guilty until proven innocent which is sort of a tough pill to swallow

3932986 in the house of representatives rep edward markey is expected to reintroduce his own net neutrality proposal which seeks similar requirements to the senate version but was defeated by the republican controlled chamber last year an aide to the massachusetts democrat who was formally named chairman of a house internet and telecommunications subcommittee on tuesday said it was not immediately clear when that action would occur
3932987 there is only a 20 percent overlap between yahoos 1st 100 results and googles 1st 100 results for the same search in their engine

3932989 we made the decision two years ago to make investments in asia the middle east and africa a priority
3932990 as a result revenue in those markets is growing faster this year than the u s business
3932991 we have initially targeted the debt capital market for dealstream because they are the most mature in terms of using intralinks
3932992 but were going to take this to other communities we serve including corporate dealmakers
3932993 i would put chelsea manchester united and liverpool as favourites again to win the premier league
3932994 but regarding arsenal they also have a great team but im not sure if the group has enough experience and quality to win
3932995 i see nobody else to win the premier league but tottenham surely have the quality to fight for a top four finish
3932996 you dont like to be scrutinized and need independence once youve proved yourself
3932997 many people in many organizations are involved in the m amp a process and since they all now have access to electronic communication channels it is more important than ever to control and monitor the flow of information about a deal before it has been announced the run up to announcement is a particularly sensitive point in the m amp a process and our research shows the potential damage caused by press leaks at this stage centralizing information flow through a system with a complete audit trail engenders better behaviour and trust that confidentiality will be respected
3932998 market leaks and insider trading receive considerable press attention but this is the first study to identify the impact of a pre announcement leak to the press companies would be wise to heed the factors identified in this research so that they are fully aware of the historical impact of such leaks on deal activity
3932999 as the financial industry looks at better ways to manage and mitigate risk we anticipate virtual datarooms vdrs to really showcase their value confidentiality and speed are vital to the success of the financial markets the very ethos lying behind vdrs and their use in the m amp a process
3933000 celana ini kalo bediri sih ga gitu keliatan ngatungnya tp kalo duduk duh ngatung pisan
3933001 celana ku kok jadi lebar banget ya kayak celana silat tak balikin lagi deh
3933002 the economics is the social science which studies human behavior as a relationship between his unlimited ends and scare means which have alternative uses
3933003 sejak malam ini wanita itu menjadi beban pikiranku dan hingga sekarang aku belum menemukan solusinya dan aku tidak tahu akhir dari masalah yang aku hadapi ini
3933004 dia adalah wanita yang orang banyak menyebutnya sebagai isteriku yang menurutku tidak lain hanya sebagai batu besar penghalang dalam mewujudkan angan angan dan keinginanku
3933005 engkau banyak angan angan wahai tuanku apa sih sebenarnya angan angan yang engkau bicarakan
3933006 cita cita dalam hidupku hanya satu yaitu aku memejamkan mata dan setelah membuka kedua mataku aku sudah tidak melihat lagi cadar bertengger di wajah setiap wanita di negeri ini
3933007 kebanyakan orang sependapat dengan ideku ini dan berangan angan seperti angan anganku mereka ingin antara wanita dan laki laki bebas duduk duduk dan bercengkerama seperti kaum wanita bebas bersenda gurau dengan sesamanya bukan sikap lemah serba tanggung dan kurang percaya diri dimana semua kebiasaan seperti itu masih dipertahankan oleh bangsa timur tatkala ingin melangkah kepada suatu hal yang baru
3933008 aku yakin bahwa akulah orang pertama yang bisa merobohkan bangunan kuno yang membelenggu kebahagiaan dan menghambat kemajuan umat bertahun tahun lamanya di negeri ini semoga saja aku bisa melakukan perombakan yang belum pernah dilakukan oleh para perintis kebebasan dan para pendukungnya gagasan ini telah aku tawarkan kepada isteriku ternyata gagasan ini dianggap berbahaya dan terkutuk bahkan seakan aku membawa petaka besar dan bencana hebat ia beranggapan bila dirinya berbaur dengan kaum laki laki maka ia akan merasa malu dan gelisah untuk berbaur kembali dengan kaum wanita
3933009 menurutku itu bukanlah sikap malu dan gelisah yang terpuji tetapi itu suatu langkah rendah diri statis dan membunuh kreativitas serta kehinaan yang ditimpakan allah kepada kaum wanita di negeri ini mereka hidup dalam kuburan gelap cadar dan jilbab yang menghasung kebebasan mereka hingga datang kematian akhirnya mereka pindah dari kuburan dunia kepada kuburan akhirat maka bagi diriku yang terpenting dalam hidupku hanyalah mewujudkan cita cita luhur ini dan aku harus mampu membelah kepala yang keras dan membatu hingga berakhir dengan dua pilihan antara pecah berantakan atau sembuh secara total
3933010 apakah engkau sudah paham atas apa yang engkau katakan wahai temanku
3933011 ya aku telah mengatakan sesuatu hakekat kebenaran yang sudah menjadi keyakinan dan ajaran bagiku dan juga menjadi keyakinan dirimu dan kebanyakan orang
3933012 bolehkah aku berbicara tentang sesuatu kepadamu kamu telah lama tinggal di negeri asing yang tidak kenal hijab dan pembatas antara kaum laki laki dan perempuan apakah kamu masih ingat pada suatu hari nuranimu membisikkan sesuatu dan berbicara kepada dirimu bahwa kamu pernah berharap dengan sangat pada sesuatu dimana tangan kanan tidak mampu meraihnya yang berkaitan dengan harga diri wanita ternyata harapan itu terpenuhi sebagian sementara pemiliknya tidak merasakan
3933013 mungkin aku masih teringat sedikit apa sebenarnya yang kamu inginkan
3933014 aku ingin mengatakan kepadamu saya sangat khawatir bila saat sekarang ada orang yang membuat rencana busuk untuk merobek harga dirimu seperti kamu saat sekarang membuat rencana kotor untuk mengganggu harga diri orang lain
3933015 wanita mulia akan tetap mampu menjaga kesucian dan harga dirinya dengan baik tanpa harus tersentuh tangan tangan jahil sedikitpun meskipun hidup berbaur dengan kaum laki laki
3933016 itu adalah tipuan syaithan terhadap dirimu wahai orang yang lemah iman dan karena adanya kelainan pada kepalamu lalu mempengaruhi kesehatan akal dan pikiranmu sehingga merusak pribadimu jiwa manusia laksana kubangan air yang menggenang akan terus bersih selagi tidak kejatuhan batu hingga menjadi keruh kehormatan adalah corak jiwa manusia bukan elemen inti jarang sekali corak dan warna bungkus itu bisa dipertahankan dan mudah sekali luntur oleh sinar matahari
3933017 saya tidak mengingkarinya karena saya melihat bukti masih ada akan tetapi saya tidak percaya kemampuan itu ada pada laki laki beringas dan penipu kehormatan begitu pula saya tidak percaya kemampuan itu ada pada wanita jalang dan penjaja kehormatan masihkah mereka memiliki sisa kehormatan tatkala keduanya melepas batas hijab dan masing masing bebas menikmati wajah temannya
3933018 sesungguhnya kerabatmu yang sewenang wenang terhadap urusanmu tidak lebih pandai dibanding dirimu bahkan tidak pernah dia mengerti dan faham keinginan dan tuntutan hidupmu sebagaimana kamu mengerti dirimu sendiri sebenarnya mereka tidak punya hak untuk campur tangan dalam urusanmu sejauh itu
3933019 kamu haus memilih sendiri pasangan hidupmu supaya keluargamu tidak menipumu yang membuat kamu kecewa dan rusak masa depanmu
3933020 kita tidak menikah kecuali dengan wanita yang kita cintai dan sayangi serta memiliki kesamaan hobi dan naluri perasaan
3933021 karena kedunguan dan kepandiran itulah aku datang ke negeri ini untuk menyembuhkan dan meluruskan maka kita tunggu saja sampai waktunya hingga allah menentukan siapa di antara kita yang paling berpihak pada kesuksesan dan kemenangan
3933022 silahkan anda menjadikan dirimu dan keluargamu sebagai kelinci percobaan sesuka hatimu dan izinkan aku mengatakan sesuatu kepadamu semenjak hari ini aku tidak mampu lagi berkunjung ke rumahmu demi untuk menjaga keutuhan perjuanganmu dan keteguhan aqidahku karena saya tahu bahwa saat saat yang paling bersahaja buatku di rumahmu adalah tatkala masih ada hijab pembatas yang jauh dari tatapan wajah isterimu sehingga rasa malu masih tetap terpelihara
3933023 aku tidak tahu tiba tiba polisi mengetuk pintuku dan mengajakku ke kantor polisi aku tidak tahu mengapa ada panggilan pada waktu seperti ini tanpa suatu sebab padahal aku bukan orang yang bersalah dan bukan orang yang mencurigakan wahai temanku bisakah aku meminta bantuanmu untuk menemaniku pada malam ini mungkin nanti aku menghadapi suatu perkara yang memerlukan bantuanmu
3933024 sesuatu yang paling aku takutkan bila malam ini terjadi apa apa pada diri isteriku saya merasa gamang dengan urusannya karena hingga saat ini isteri saya belum pulang dan hal ini tidak biasa dia lakukan
3933025 saya tidak merasa takut kecuali hanya satu hal saya tahu bahwa isteri saya pencemburu dan ceroboh mungkin saja ada orang yang mengganggu di tengah jalan lalu isteriku berlaku kasar terhadap orang tersebut sehingga terjadi perkelahian yang berlanjut ke kantor polisi
3933026 tidak akan saya masukkan ke rumah ini kecuali orang yang kamu izinkan
3933027 tidak ada sesuatu hanya saya ingin katakan bahwa saya telah memaafkannya
3933028 adakah orang yang mau membantuku untuk menyampaikan kabar kepada keluarga isteriku bahwa sekarang aku dalam keadaan sakit parah dan saya khawatir bila allah memanggilku aku masih mempunyai tanggungan dosa terhadap mereka saya memohon dengan sangat agar mereka mau memberi maaf dan pengampunan atas seluruh kesalahanku sebelum ajal menjemputku
3933029 dahulu aku pernah bersumpah di hadapan orang tuanya pada saat aku meminangnya untuk menjaga kehormatan anak gadisnya seperti aku menjaga kehidupanku dan aku telah berjanji untuk melindunginya sebagaimana aku melindungi diriku ternyata sekarang aku melanggar janji itu
3933030 benar dia telah membunuhku tetapi akulah orang yang memberi pedangnya untuk menghunuskan ke dadaku maka jangan salahkan dia karena dosaku rumah itu adalah rumahku perempuan itu adalah isteriku dan laki laki itu adalah temanku maka akulah yang membukakan pintu untuk temanku kepada isteriku maka tiada seorangpun yang berdosa dalam hal ini kecuali hanya aku
3933031 aduh kenapa pandanganku menjadi gelap gulita dunia serasa sangat sempit di wajahku di kamar ini dan di tempat duduk ini aku melihat keduanya sedang duduk bersanding dengan mesra sehingga membuat hatiku tergores antara perasaan iri dan bahagia saya bersyukur kepada allah karena aku dikaruniai seorang teman setia yang mampu menghibur kesepian isteriku di kala sedang sendiri dan dikaruniai seorang isteri yang mengerti dan murah hati dalam menyambut temanku dengan sambutan yang sangat hangat pada saat berada jauh dariku katakan kepada semua orang bahwa orang yang dahulu mengaku paling cerdik dan pintar sekarang telah berubah menjadi orang yang paling dungu dan pandir sedunia betapa bahagianya bila ibuku tidak melahirkanku dan ayahku seorang mandul yang tidak dikaruniai putera puteri
3933032 mungkin orang orang mengerti masalah yang aku tidak ketahui boleh jadi dahulu orang orang mengejek dan mencerca kedunguanku atau memelototkan pandangan ke wajahku tatkala aku lewat di depan mereka untuk melihat kepandiran yang tampak di wajah orang yang pandir dan kedunguan yang tergores di wajah orang yang dungu ini
3933033 boleh jadi orang orang atau teman temanku yang bersahabat dan dekat denganku hanya karena ingin mendapat bagian kelezatan dari isteriku bukan karena ingin berteman denganku bisa jadi mereka menyebutku sebagai germo dan isteriku sebagai pelacur serta rumahku sebagai tempat penjaja sex dan pengobral kehormatan sementara aku menyangka pada saat itu bahwa aku orang yang paling mulia dan terhormat di antara mereka
3933034 masihkah rahmat berpihak kepadaku sehingga masih ada kesempatan hidup barang sesaat dan betapa ngerinya hidup sendirian di pojok liang lahat yang sangat seram menghimpitku bersama kehinaan dan rasa maluku
3933035 janganlah kamu keluar dari dunia ini dalam keadaan ragu terhadap anakmu sesungguhnya ibunya mengakui dosa dosanya di depanmu pada saat engkau pergi menghadap rabbmu meskipun dia sudah dekat dengan perbuatan terkutuk tapi belum merasakan kelezatan buah terkutuk itu maafkan aku wahai bapaknya anakku dan mintalah kepada allah tatkala engkau menghadap kepada rabbmu agar aku bisa dipertemukan denganmu tidak ada kebaikan bagiku setelah kematianmu
3933036 ah yes america very good is this your first time in india
3933037 well vietnam is a country very close to china there was a very long and very terrible war there it was the only war america ever lost
3933038 this memorial is for all the americans who fought there
3933039 i dont know pj its been another very long and terrible war and some people want us to stop fighting and go home
3933040 do you mean the enemy wants us to go home
3933041 but i mean some americans its been a very long war and some people are tired of fighting its been going on almost your whole life its been going on since before you could really talk
3933042 so what if we leave who really cares if iraq falls apart
3933043 no daddy were not supposed to retreat we should never give up
3933044 but how long is too long when should we give up
3933045 theres a large train of thought that one of the best ways of dealing with avian influenza is by detection and containment
3933046 the ability to detect and type the influenza virus immediately is essential in setting up controls as quickly as possible to minimise the spread of any potential pandemic virus
3933047 they have been talking about it for four decades but that never seems to be enough
3933048 the government was quick to move for things like id cards or 42 day detention without trial now it needs to show similar leadership in public health
3933049 the threat to our future health is just as significant as the current security threat
3933050 lots of the initiatives are under a voluntary agreement but it has just come to the point where things like these are simply not working
3933051 lord darzis recent review envisioned an nhs that is as good at preventing ill health as it is at treating the sick
3933052 we are tackling obesity through awareness campaigns and action in schools our alcohol and sexual health campaigns encourage responsible drinking and safer sex
3933053 we set voluntary targets for salt and have seen considerable reductions in a range of food
3933054 this is one grand daddy of spicy beef recipes that you have to try i came across this dish while traveling the jungle waterways of cambodia looking for my lost love cocoa my guide there in khmer krom says that it is such a delicacy the folks saved it for weddings and big celebrations i almost died on that trip so you better try it and tell me what you think
3933055 ik hoopte vooral dat het wat rust in mn hoofd zou brengen
3933056 ik dacht wie niet waagt die niet wint wel hoopte ik er rustiger van te worden
3933057 daardoor had ik meer energie voor de dagelijkse gang van zaken zoals het huishouden en dat z nder gebruik van slaapmiddelen
3933058 liam is veel rustiger slaapt beter en kan zich beter concentreren ook op school gaat het beter doordat prikkels minder doordringen mijn man heeft ook tourette en ook hij ondervindt dezelfde voordelen het is een verademing
3933059 af en toe was timo misschien wel wat kalmer maar dat kan ook toeval geweest zijn
3933060 ik heb vaak spierpijn door mn tics die pijn werd door de ontspannende werking van de david verlicht daardoor kon ik mijn tics ook beter onder controle houden
3933061 op elk persoon heeft het waarschijnlijk een ander effect ik raad het dan ook iedereen aan ook personen die geen aandoening hebben je weet maar nooit
3933062 je moet het eerst proberen om te weten of het voor jou werkt gelukkig is de david ook te huur
3933063 tourette en hoop dan dat mensen mij bijzonder vinden terwijl ik zonder tourette ook bijzonder ben vooral mijn persoonlijkheid is bijzonder en daarnaast komt pas tourette wat dan op zijn minst ook bijzonder is
3933064 our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
3933065 you little jew bastards walk up and down the aisles leaving little clumps of jew s t behind you and you expect me to come with a f king pail and shovel and clean it up
3933066 give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us
3933067 het zal wel zus en zo heten maar ik kan daar niets mee
3933068 contrary to the association of tic prevalence and severity with the male gender in childhood ts female gender independently may predict greater adult tic severity
3933069 this suggests the possibility of gender related differences in the long term natural history of tics in ts
3933070 in addition to any genetic influences epigenetic factors processes that affects a cell without directly affecting its dna or environmental factors may play an important role in tic expression over ones lifetime and these factors also may be influenced by gender
3933071 in addition this study found that development and long term expression of tics and comorbid conditions in ts appear to be influenced separately
3933072 if these results are confirmed this research will identify both age and gender as significant influences that may interact with genetic and environmental factors to affect the severity of tics over the course of an individuals lifetime
3933073 this may reflect gender related differences that have been observed in various brain systems including dopaminergic neurons in response to aging
3933074 88 here he told me again but that ace on the turn made me fall in love with my hand
3933075 well that must have been grown in idaho and wyoming
3933076 you know this is very personal for me its not just political its not just public i see whats happening and we have to reverse it
3933077 some people think elections are a game lots of whos up or whos down but its about our country its about our kids futures and its really about all of us together
3933078 give me all your money this is not a joke sorry

3933080 pangatlong rollback na bale in just 21 days p3 50 per liter na ang nabawas sa presyo gasolina at p1 50 sa diesel
3933081 well anybodys guess yan puwedeng mangyari pwede ring di mangyari volatile kasi ang market
3933082 kung bumaba sa world market halimbawa isang transaksyon di ibig sabihin yon na rin ang aktwal na nabibili natin yon ay for delivery pa sa september kaya minsan nagkakaroon ng misconception na bakit di naro rollback agad ay dahil yon naman ay darating pa mga 15 30 days pa yon at ang gingamit namin ngayon ay yong naangkat na dumating pa noong hulyo
3933083 ngayon pa lang kaya nagsimula nang mag discount na two weeks ago pa ay inaanticipate namin ang mababa in effect sakripisyo na rin yon pero gusto rin natin ay bumalik ang mga motorista sa kalsada ang mga motorista talagang bumaba yong demand napansin naming noong tumataas one way of encouraging demand para lahat ng motorista muling timangkilik sa paggamit ng langis at gaolina
3933084 di rin naman biglaan ang pagbaba dahil installment din ang pagbaba kung talgang bumaba pa yan sa september pwedeng malaki pa sa piso
3933085 kung ako ang tatanungin mas gusto ko isang bagsak na lang ang 3 to 5 pesos na rollback sa setyembre
3933086 we expect that by september theres going to be a weekly rollback because world oil prices are going down
3933087 about half of them have returned and we hope that the rest can go back to their homes the day after tomorrow
3933088 the automated elections are a success despite some untoward incidents arising primarily from ballot snatchings in some isolated areas the results remain

3933107 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3933108 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3933109 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3933110 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3933111 poor reputation for insensitivity toward racial issues has been further harmed
3933112 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offence and has apologised
3933113 the matter rests there as far as the ioc is concerned
3933114 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
3933115 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3933116 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3933117 we dont think this is an insulting gesture to the chinese
3933118 in fact the gesture shows that the spanish team is so humorous relaxing and cute they sat around a dragon pattern which we think showed respect to the chinese
3933119 li ning ltd will not change any business plans with the spanish team because of this
3933120 people should focus on great olympic games instead of something else

3933126 working with the staff here is thoroughly enjoyable im having a lot of fun

3933135 a corporate structure would better enable sun gro to execute its growth strategy and reduce its debt levels
3933136 weve reached the point where a corporate structure may be more suitable for sun gro
3933137 under the current circumstances we believe there are opportunities for future growth and acquisitions that are best achieved as a corporation
3933138 if and when the proposed conversion is approved sun gros immediate plan would be to use a significant portion of its cash flow to reduce its debt levels
3933139 we are working to complete the proposed conversion during the fourth quarter
3933140 ebitda free cash flow and levered free cash flow all showed significant growth in q2 versus 2007 ebitda increased 56 unlevered cash flow was a positive 5 5 m and if i allocated cash interest for the year to q2 levered cash flow is within 1 m of breaking even and that represents significant progress for us syscon revenue is up sequentially by double digits we settled multiple long standing patent infringement lawsuits that will save us several million dollars in outside legal fees on a go forward basis and we have taken actions that are increasing the quality of our revenue and decreasing bad debt all very nice accomplishments for q2 we have a lot of work to do in terms of growing ebitda managing capital expenditures and growing core or direct provisioning and syscon revenue streams and we are working hard to do that

3933143 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3933144 we dont have any indication that he knew chairman gwatney
3933145 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3933146 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
3933147 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas
3933148 were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3933149 pinning huckabee down on an issue is like nailing jello to the wall
3933150 the senseless shooting at democratic party headquarters in little rock today is a shocking and sobering reminder of just how depraved our world has become all of our thoughts and prayers turn toward bill gwatney and his family today while we await details on what happened and why
3933151 arkansas democratic party chairman dead after shooting inside party headquarters
3933152 got scared and he ran over here he was bleeding
3933153 i kept telling him you dont want to do this
3933154 a banned hazardous substance under the federal hazardous substances act
3933155 a panel which lacks the necessary expertise and impartiality is saying it knows better than specialists on the substance who are calling for a precautionary approach
3933156 this is historic legislation that will protect the safety of our children and it is long past time to get these toxic toys off our shores and out of our stores
3933157 its wide open racing and you can run from top to bottom the biggest thing is just trying to get grip here some guys are able to get it other guys cant you can get it for maybe five laps and then youre just out to lunch the biggest thing is just trying to make your car comfortable and make it last throughout a whole tire run and of course make it fast too
3933158 my brother kurt moved up to michigan years ago to run in the craftsman truck series and he went to a michigan game
3933159 he bought me a michigan sweatshirt and sent it home for me i never really paid attention to college football until then but i became a michigan fan not too complicated of a story but its fun to be able to follow them when i have a saturday afternoon off in the fall i was lucky enough to be able to go to their practice last fall and get to know a few of the guys you always respect people who are as competitive as you are and they certainly have the same drive to win that i do
3933160 i always say darlington is my favorite race track but michigan is becoming a close second
3933161 michigan has a lot of personal history for me and im always glad to go there its where i made my first cup start where i made my 100th start and where i broke a 52 race winless streak with a win in june of last year its a great track with some really awesome racing you can pass and i think the fans always see a good show there michigan is a kind of bragging rights track its in roushs backyard fords backyard so another win there would be huge
3933162 theres no way to tell right now whos got the best chance of winning the championship
3933163 there are enough teams that are running well right now theres a number of teams that can win every week and it seems like theres more people getting stronger as we go
3933164 these next races are win at all costs just get the wins get the bonus points
3933165 to be honest with you im shocked that we havent won here
3933166 weve had very good cars and have been in contention a couple of different times it always seems like theres a crazy strategy at the end that keeps us from winning its either a two tire deal weve taken no tires when weve had a great race car and been leading and lost to guys that have had tires weve also lost to fuel mileage before so its just a weird finish to this race in some cases the best car wins here but in other cases its something strategy wise that plays out and it just hasnt worked for us here
3933167 we were good all weekend and just came up a little short we battled a tight race car and had a tire go down early on but we were able to battle back and get a good finish
3933168 it is a lot of fun to race on these cars are pretty challenging this year but that is still a fun track for me we are sort of starting to swing back toward the tracks that we have better runs at and we have better luck at i have had some rough rough rough runs this summer he has only one top 10 finish since his victory in june but that seems to be the case every year i wasnt a bit surprised that we didnt really light em on fire this summertime but we will try again next year
3933169 what are we going to have to do to get a good finish
3933170 i was happy we had a good car we learned a lot at the saturday race i lost a lot of foot brakes as the race got going and the car got real tight the splitter was on the ground a little bit too much but that sort of did foil our strategy more important i think is trying to get the car more durable i really wasnt running that hard out front and i was actually slowing down and taking it easy when jimmie johnson was catching me i didnt push the issue any harder and the front brakes just quit on it as the day goes it gets hot and slick
3933171 i think a lot of might have been not so much the competition itself but the personalities
3933172 you know the dale earnhardts the darrell waltrips the bobby allisons and others we have a lot of great personalities now but the sport itself has become a whole lot more corporate and a lot less personal in that respect to me those guys were different i dont know how to explain it but they were just different they really wore everything on their sleeves about this sport and how they raced how each weekend went and how they felt about everything they could be that way where we are not able to be like that as much anymore because everything gets published and printed you have to be a whole lot more stale than you want to be the racing was different but i personally dont think it was better then i think actually if you laid down two races side by side what we have today and what they had then i think you would sell more tickets to what we have today due to the fact that there are more cars with the opportunity to win and there is still a lot of drama and stuff that goes on during a races that makes it exciting i think if you ask the fans what lot of drivers they would prefer they might say the old guys i would
3933173 we havent run as well at michigan as we would have liked to but we have put a lot of effort in to finding a way to be better there
3933174 theres something about that track that we dont understand and im obviously part of that equation what im looking for in a car and what the car actually does is very hard to achieve were approaching michigan with an open mind and a different thought process on how to get it done michigan has been our biggest challenge as far as two mile tracks are concerned so were going to put a lot of effort in to studying past races and hopefully turn our bad luck at michigan around
3933175 we stuck to our pit strategy and unfortunately we had trouble with the rear tire and lost some spots all in all it was a decent day i cant complain the team constantly works hard and i have faith that well back to our top 10 form
3933176 i dont think that were grossly behind but if you look at the speed that jimmie johnson and his team produce from time to time the speed that kyle busch and his team have been able to produce we havent been able to do that i think we do really well in a lot of areas but weve got to find a way to create some speed were a solid company we do a lot of things really well were always striving to do it better im really really proud to be part of rcr weve been very competitive over the last three years but i think its fair to say numbers dont lie and if you look at jimmie johnson and what theyve been able to do they have set a really high standard and thats hard to keep up with
3933177 we were decent in june but we lost track position during one exchange of pit stops and were fighting traffic the rest of the race
3933178 staying in the lead group is a good way to stay out of traffic
3933179 we really missed the set up there wasnt much we could do about it other than just fight
3933180 this team is capable of winning the championship this year thanks to the chase structure
3933181 a lot can happen in 10 races and we need to make sure were consistently running up front we have the tools necessary to do it and a strong showing this weekend can put us on the right track
3933182 i was pretty happy with it and it was pretty uneventful from our side
3933183 we didnt have any big dramas during the race the red flag there at the end kind of killed us a little bit but im really happy with the day the thing that hurt us at the end was the red flag that cooled the tires down and dropped the air pressures it seemed like we were a little low on the left front tire and it seemed like when the pressures were really low that it made the front end hook to the right even if we got that fixed im not sure that we were going to be fast enough to get by kyle busch he never made a mistake he had a really good car today and he was fast in all the right spots that he needed to be fast in i think he ran a perfect race today and i thought we were really close were talking nit picking stuff to get our car perfect i was really proud of our guys pit stops were good today i thought zippy greg zipadelli crew chief had good pit strategy its days like today that you want every week to be uneventful and to be this smooth every day
3933184 i am a lot more comfortable with the momentum for sure
3933185 sundays finish doesnt necessarily mean that next week when we get back to our normal discipline of running ovals that its going to be on track and where we want it to be i think the last two weeks has shown how focused our team is at the job at hand it makes me proud of our guys and proud of our whole organization to have kyle busch win and us run second and i looked up and denny hamlin was fifth at one point all three of us had good cars today
3933186 michigan has been a good track for us ive run second here and weve won here
3933187 we had a real loose race car back in june and we just tried to keep fixing it and getting the car better and we did at the end of the race the final run was the best that our dodge was all day
3933188 i have a lot of confidence in kenny francis the crew chief and all the calls he makes especially with tires and fuel
3933189 we played the fuel mileage game here in june and it worked out in our favor the guys keep working on our fuel mileage program with our dodge and we continue to improve
3933190 honestly i think weve been better at michigan than our results have shown
3933191 if not for some mileage issues and some pit road issues over the course of our races here wed probably have come close to a win but certainly would have posted some top five or top 10 finishes instead weve had to settle for some top 20 finishes and thats frustrating weve had some really competitive cars so its just a matter of it all coming together for us at the right time
3933192 we were just a little off today but this fedex ground crew worked hard and we brought home a top 10 finish i really couldnt push the car more than i was or i would have wrecked it and that would have been a worst case scenario we had good strategy today some good calls by mike ford and the crew but our car wasnt quite there
3933193 mro has been a friend to the drivers teams and everyone affiliated with the sport for a long time so i was really happy to be able to help them out
3933194 it seems like everyone in the garage supports mro in one way or another and they deserve the recognition by donating my motor home to them i hope it will save them some money in lodging and i think it will really give them the opportunity to do more and more within in the sport i know well all benefit from that and i am proud to support their efforts
3933195 michigan has always been one of my favorite tracks on the circuit
3933196 its fast and it allows for a lot of passing because it is so wide we won back to back races there in 2004 and 2005 and i think that a win this weekend is a reasonable goal its always great to win in michigan because its kind of the home track for ford and roush
3933197 these cars are all pretty similar so we feel confident with it
3933198 i think we have a good chance to win this weekend michigan is one of gregs favorite tracks and he is very strong there we have to work on giving the car more rear grip as the race goes on we struggled with that a little there in june we had a really good qualifying run there in june but it got rained out so i think weve got a good shot at our third pole of the year
3933199 i feel like we have made a lot of improvements on our cars since the last race at michigan when he finished 12th
3933200 everything that we are racing now is totally different from where we were with bump stops chassis and all the different things that are on our cars now
3933201 it was a great points day for us but just as important it just continues to show how strong our team is
3933202 we started out loose and wheel hopping but todd berrier the crew chief made good pit calls and we kept getting the car better as the race went on it was just a good day for this whole crew
3933203 we have had a lot of stuff go wrong this year and we are still in the hunt
3933204 i think the maturity in our team shows the most when we havent been the best car out there but we have found a way to finish in the top 15
3933205 we usually have good cars there and this weekend were bringing what i think is a good car
3933206 rk 473 is a car that ive raced several times this year and it just seems to get the job done i dont think ive finished outside the top 10 in it all year
3933207 we had an average car and we had a real above average strategy and pit crew so those guys got me the good finish
3933208 michigan and the next several races are some of my favorite tracks for sure
3933209 michigan bristol fontana and richmond are some of my favorite tracks and i always look forward to this stretch of races everyone is going chase crazy these days for me i just go out every week and try to get the best finish i can
3933210 for some reason we havent been able to find the right balance or right level of grip to run well there
3933211 but i like tracks like michigan where you can mix it up and pass on the top or the bottom and try different things typically on big tracks where you can move around and carry a lot of speed we usually run well we need to run well this weekend
3933212 we had a plan for fuel mileage and we thought it was going to work
3933213 it was working until the last couple of cautions helped everybody else finish without needing to stop for fuel we were pretty good but luck just didnt go our way today
3933214 there is a lot that can happen in the four races before the chase begins
3933215 weve been testing our rear ends off weve been in nashville the last three weeks trying to figure this thing out so we can go to michigan and be good there were doing everything we can do to make sure that were in this thing we know how important it is and we want to be a part of it
3933216 were taking a proven car that should perform well so it should be a good weekend for us
3933217 we didnt have the speed we needed to be aggressive on the track and we had a flat tire with a couple of restarts to go which cost us some track position it was just a long day
3933218 we dug ourselves a hole at watkins glen but weve got some good tracks coming up so hopefully we can make up some ground david did well last time we were at michigan so theres no reason we shouldnt be able to go back there and do it again finish in the top 10
3933219 we know that we really cant afford to finish outside the top five in the next four races and even then we probably need a win or two to get us in the top 12
3933220 we had a really good car all day we charged from 17th where we started for a long time we were one of the best cars on the track the last set of tires we got a little bit too loose but i had a lot of fun out there today its great to get another top five his third of the year its been a while coming
3933221 big for a couple of reasons obviously it helped us points wise more important it picked everybodys spirits up we had kind of struggled the last couple of weeks so we needed a good run
3933222 the guys did a great job improving this car from where it was in practice
3933223 all their hard work paid off it definitely felt like a different car
3933224 weve made a lot of gains to where were running good and are approaching the area of running great i look for big things
3933225 when was the last race there that wasnt a fuel mileage race
3933226 look back over the last month or so of racing including the june race at michigan and our win at loudon as well as daytona chicago indy pocono and the glen fuel mileage has played a role in all of them
3933227 we hardly made any adjustments we had to make sure we had enough fuel after last week when he ran out twice that was a good day for us
3933228 you dont want a tight race car if youre tight youre burning more fuel and you need to loosen it the car up if it is tight it binds up while turning through the corners and it takes more gas to propel the car forward
3933229 we thought going into the race that we had a pretty solid plan but when the cautions did not fall the way we needed them to the plan fell apart we just didnt produce the finish i know we were capable of
3933230 going into michigan in june we told people that our cars were fast but we just couldnt get the finish out of them
3933231 that weekend we not only showed how fast our cars were but left with the finish to prove it
3933232 a win this weekend would mean a lot to a lot of people
3933233 i think if we had started in the top 10 we could have finished in the top 10
3933234 starting back there 22nd after qualifying was rained out we just didnt have opportunities to get track position other than that it was a good day for us
3933235 was definitely the place to be in the june race so well work toward getting our car comfortable up there this weekend
3933236 probably as guilty as anyone of not giving nascar enough credit for all of the safety initiatives they have introduced to our sport in the last five years all it takes is to be involved in an accident like we had at the end of the race at watkins glen to send you a reminder there is no doubt that this is the safest race car in the world
3933237 when the chemistry is good like it is now between him and crew chief brian pattie you have to build on it
3933238 but my main focus was to get a good result fourth weve had so many problems the last few races that we needed to get a good race and try to gain in the driver point standings
3933239 i think we had a pretty solid run back in june
3933240 i think that if we take what we had in june in regards to our set ups and improve upon those a little bit we should have a car that can definitely contend for a top 10 finish on sunday
3933241 im still learning so much about road racing ive only had the chance to race at watkins glen one time prior to today so it was very important for me to focus on my laps and learn the rhythms associated with the turns here this track is very fast and the more chances i get to drive here the better ill be
3933242 this will be our second time around going to michigan this season and i feel really good about it
3933243 i feel that were going to be even better the second time around at some of these tracks we ran well at earlier in the season
3933244 weve had some tough breaks the past few weeks but i really feel that our team is constantly growing and building upon what we learn about our cars at each race
3933245 now we just need to ensure that we get the finishes we know this team deserves
3933246 this was not the way we wanted to end our afternoon
3933247 we had a much better car than our finish showed in the june race at michigan so this weekend were looking to make our own luck i feel that our team continues to get more and more competitive every week
3933248 if we can keep coming to the track with these types of race cars i think we will have a good chance at winning one or two races before the year is over
3933249 my only experience at this track prior to this weekend was in nascar video games
3933250 my goal was to stay on the pavement finish the race and gain more experience in road course racing i felt i did some good things out there today and some not so good things
3933251 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3933252 we are stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded bill is not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante our thoughts and prayers are with bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery
3933253 they bundled me out of the park they forced me to the floor dragged me manhandled me into a restaurant next door
3933254 were definitely in fear mode in the market this is a classic correction
3933255 youre going to get this sort of fear activity when theres very little conviction
3933256 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
3933257 the way through this is to try to look at everything a little bit further down the road and just buckle up because its going to be a pretty wild ride
3933258 theres a large train of thought that one of the best ways of dealing with avian influenza is by detection and containment
3933259 the ability to detect and type the influenza virus immediately is essential in setting up controls as quickly as possible to minimise the spread of any potential pandemic virus
3933260 it takes a lot of effort to find people who live and work near you and who work roughly the same hours but with a ride matching programme you simply enter your journey details through a secure website and match them with other colleagues
3933261 international research has found that car pooling with co workers is more effective in reducing vehicle trips and kilometres travelled than ride sharing with family and friends
3933262 car pooling has more chances of success when incentives are available possible incentives include priority parking reduced cost or free parking for car poolers and reward programmes
3933263 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3933264 systemic antibiotics pills or injections as opposed to creams were implicated in 19 3 percent of all emergency department visits for drug related adverse events
3933265 persons aged 15 44 years accounted for an estimated 41 2 percent of ed visits infants accounted for only an estimated 6 3 percent of ed visits
3933266 they are not old friends they were friends 20 years ago for about 20 minutes and i think that they might have reconnected briefly over some web site stuff
3933267 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3933268 there are a number of impressive potential vice presidential candidates and this is a singular decision for one person and that is barack obama
3933269 but personally id be hopeful in the list of serious candidates to be considered would be chuck hagel whether it be for the veep position or a serious position in an obama administration
3933270 sen hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns and is not planning to endorse either candidate
3933271 between one candidate john mccain whos always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3933272 in the 3 years barack obama has been in the senate with all respect there is very little evidence of that kind of bipartisan outreach
3933273 john mccain has lived it worked it done it thats why i think in the end which is election day which we hope is just the beginning there are going to be many more democrats who will vote for john mccain than republicans who will vote for barack obama
3933274 obamas judgment about the war was the central tenet of one of the two best arguments for his earning the democratic nomination his offering a break from old washington was the other
3933275 choosing evan bayh a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
3933276 even if we are wrong on the perceived threat getting rid of saddam will be good for our oil supplies
3933277 acquiring mo strengthens our nucleus of players for both the short and long term he is entering his prime nba years and will be part of the foundation of our future success
3933278 his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
3933279 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland
3933280 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
3933281 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
3933282 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit
3933283 how certain human beings are able to create works of art is a mystery and why they should wish to do so at a great cost to themselves usually is another mystery works are not created by ones life every life is rich in

3933287 there is a significant concern that australia will once again be bullied into accepting a deal which is bad for australian creators and users this treaty will further distort copyright law for the benefit of us copyright owners and will not reflect a thoughtful balance designed to encourage the creation and dissemination of copyright works
3933288 this process is likely to require the afp and customs to act as copyright police and diverting their attention from much more serious issues such as drug smuggling
3933289 many of the creative activities undertaken by individuals in the digital economy exist in the grey area of tolerated uses these areas of tolerated use allow individuals to engage with copyright material in ways which may be technically infringing but because no harm is caused to the copyright owner they are implicity permitted by requiring that the australian public authorities police infringing activities the grey area disappears and so does the wealth of creative endeavour which accompanies it
3933290 australia risks crippling its creative industries and the creative spirit of individuals who engage with copyright material

3933411 the groups result reflected good contributions from a number of large construction projects in australia and the gulf another solid property development performance and the contract mining of iron ore and coal in australia and indonesia
3933412 the groups outlook remains strong for the 2009 financial year sustained by a record level of work in hand
3933413 infrastructure investment is forecast to stay at historically high levels fuelled by major funding commitments from the federal and state governments
3933414 the resources market is expected to remain strong for the group fuelled by international demand for iron ore and coal
3933415 fuelled by petrodollars the gulf is enjoying a construction boom which should continue to offer the habtoor leighton group numerous opportunities

3933421 energy food and cosmetics companies relying on agribusiness products particularly palm oil are increasingly scrutinized for perceived impacts on rainforests
3933422 by purchasing certificates buyers can claim a transparent and credible contribution to high value forest conservation
3933423 to date public and philanthropic funding sources for conservation have not kept pace with the rate of biodiversity loss
3933424 attaching value to conservation will harness private sector finance to help fill this funding gap
3933425 energy food and cosmetics companies relying on agribusiness products particularly palm oil are increasingly scrutinized for perceived impacts on rainforests
3933426 by purchasing certificates buyers can claim a transparent and credible contribution to high value forest conservation
3933427 nothing like this has ever been done for the biodiversity in tropical rainforests
3933428 the malua biobank translates rainforest protection into a salable product so that biodiversity conservation can compete with oter land uses on a commercial basis
3933429 we are seeing companies becoming increasingly interested in contributing to rainforest conservation in a way that is meaningfuland financially sustainable
3933430 the malua biobank provides them with a transparent and cost effective way of doing this
3933431 to date public and philanthropic funding sources for conservation have not kept pace with the rate of biodiversity loss
3933432 attaching value to conservation will harness private sector finance to help fill this funding gap
3933433 the rehabilitation process will include planting seedlings to reestablish key rainforest species and enhancing natural food reources for wildlife until the area regenerates into healthy tropical rainforest
3933434 regular monitoring of forest regeneration water quality and wildlife are just a part of the comprehensive conservation strategy the malua biobank will also work with local communities and landowners to uphold the prohibition against hunting within the reserve and to prevent illegal logging
3933435 the ultimate aim of the malua biobank is to shift land use towards rainforest restoration and preservation catalyzing a new economy of conservation in the process
3933436 once an area has established an economic framework to support long term sustainable use money can be moved to other critical conservation areas to initiate the process again in this way the malua biobank model can act as a stepping stone toward the long term preservation of high biodiversity areas throughout a region or country

3933443 i just thought well its not so much the kids fault because i know how that is its the coachs fault whos allowing that to happen
3933444 i wish i could talk to kids and say look what happened to me
3933445 my arm actually started hurting during my sophomore year and it didnt get better
3933446 in high school i threw a lot in legion i threw a lot also in the summer i pitched for the town team when i was 16
3933447 my arm always dropped off toward the tail end of the year and into summer
3933448 the more innings i threw the worse it got and i threw a lot of innings i threw at least once a week for legion and a lot of times id throw four or five innings maybe a full game for the town team so a lot of times id throw two games a week even while i was still in high school
3933449 it got to the point where i couldnt even cut insulation with a knife my arm hurt so bad
3933450 i couldnt do anything i couldnt lift five pounds straight up from my body
3933451 in my freshman year of college i was still young enough to play legion along with playing for the town team
3933452 in two weeks i threw six complete games that was something like 600 pitches in two weeks and here i sit two shoulder surgeries later
3933453 i threw all of last summer and half of the college season with a completely torn labrum
3933454 doctors determined his right shoulder blade was an inch and a half higher than his left shoulder blade an adaptation his body made from so much strain on his pitching arm
3933455 peterson played with a tendon in his throwing arm that was detached from the bone
3933456 id love to get his number and give him a piece of my mind because thats absolutely ridiculous
3933457 i guarantee you that if he keeps that stuff up that kids arm is going to go out eventually it may not be this year but i guarantee hell see signs of it
3933458 i dont like to make myself an example but i want to make myself an example for a lot of young kids look what can happen im shot already and im 23 years old
3933459 that coach needs to be smart and say you know what yeah id like to win this game but its not worth wrecking my sons arm
3933460 you have to be thinking about that arm rather than a dumb legion game yeah it means a lot to you right now but really really
3933461 my arm would be barely hanging on and the coaches would say can you throw today
3933462 my labrum was completely torn off my bicep and why did that happen its because i always said my arm felt fine the college coaches were smart enough to know theyd say you have to be honest hows your arm hows your arm id say its fine and i regret it a lot
3933463 we live in an era in which sports no matter the level are taken incredibly seriously
3933464 is a kid really going to say no my arm hurts no they wont
3933465 you know how it is as a young kid youre invincible youre not going to get hurt you can keep throwing and your arm is always going to be good
3933466 i am the ace of the team you have to trust me
3933467 this is no time to say im tired if youre getting outs you have to stay in there
3933468 if anyone wants to blame grady they shouldnt point their fingers at him he doesnt play the game if you want to blame someone blame me
3933469 sammy is one of those kids i went out there in the sixth to get him out and he was mad my pitchers tell me when theyre shot except for him he never wants to come out i dont know what this complete game stuff is big deal he talked me into one more which i shouldnt have done and when i came out again he was mad
3933470 the young guys on our town ball team who throw i really kind of mother them because i dont want them to go through the same thing i went through
3933471 a lot of these guys have a lot of potential and coaches are always like can we get a couple of innings out of you
3933472 in my first year at dakota county technical i had a white sox scout looking at me
3933473 thats when my arm wasnt hurting too bad i was popping high to mid 80s at the time but then my arm would wear down
3933474 our team was bad and we didnt have a whole lot of pitching im not blaming the coach at all because it was always me but my arm hurt so bad that i relied on vicodin the whole second half of the season
3933475 im sure im just like 100 000 kids who are pitching too much and im sure all of them have elbow or shoulder trouble too
3933476 but god if i could say anything to young kids its
3933477 there i was a 20 year old kid after my first surgery unable to lift my arm i dont want to be a crippled old guy at 35 or 40 you know id like to be able to play catch with my kid some day

3933504 above all else guard your heart for it is the wellspring of life
3933505 a person who knows how to start well but finds it difficult to keep going
3933506 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3933507 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3933508 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3933509 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3933510 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3933511 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3933512 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3933513 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3933514 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3933515 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3933516 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3933517 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3933518 as always he is holding his cards close and waiting for more information
3933519 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
3933520 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
3933521 i have voted for members of both parties in the course of my adult life and as i said earlier i will vote for the candidate i think can do the best job for america whether that candidate is a republican a democrat or an independent
3933522 he has energized a lot of people around the world and so i think he is worth listening to and seeing what he stands for
3933523 he likes and admires john mccain and that would be a factor in anything he does if he decides to get more involved
3933524 and likes him and is looking for a reason to vote for him he hasnt found it yet
3933525 i will ultimately vote for the person i believe brings to the american people the kind of vision the american people want to see for the next four years
3933526 a vision that reaches out to the rest of the world that starts to restore confidence in america that starts to restore favorable ratings to america frankly weve lost a lot in recent years
3933527 signal that choice sends about the character and judgment of the candidate
3933528 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3933529 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3933530 that will make the 40 40 club in vegas the largest sports booking operation
3933531 people can gamble both at the tables and on games the sands will also have the right to open 40 40 clubs in london and across europe
3933532 israel is following with great concern the developments in south ossetia and abkhazia and hopes the violence will end
3933533 israel recognizes the territorial integrity of georgia and calls for a peaceful solution
3933534 you need to stop what you are doing on the web

3933536 tom im just giving you some good advice you should take my advice tom

3933538 nenek bisu sering kukatakan padamu bahwa aku senantiasa terkenang kepada lenghou toako siang terkenang malam terkenang mimpi juga selalu mengimpikan dia teringat olehku waktu dia menolong diriku tanpa menghiraukan bahaya akan jiwa sendiri sesudah dia terluka kupondong dia melarikan diri teringat olehku dia minta aku mendongeng baginya lebih lebih sering teringat olehku ketika aku dan dia ti tidur bersama di suatu ranjang di rumah apa itu di kota heng san satu selimut kami pakai bersama nenek bisu kutahu engkau tak bisa mendengar maka aku takkan malu mengatakan hal hal itu padamu jika tak kukatakan rasanya aku bisa gila kubicara denganmu kupanggil nama lenghou toako maka untuk beberapa hari hatiku akan merasa tenteram
3933539 bila aku belum punya ing ing rasanya tidak dapat lagi aku mengingkari dia dan pasti akan menikahi siausumoay ini dia sedemikian mendalam mencintai aku selama hidupku ini cara bagaimana harus kubalasnya
3933540 nenek bisu ayah tidak memahami perasaanku gi ho gi jing dan suci lain juga tidak memahami diriku
3933541 setiap hari aku membaca kitab yang mengajarkan agar memandang segala apa di dunia fana ini sebagai khayal belaka biarpun cantik jelita gagah cakap akhirnya juga tinggal tulang belulang saja apakah artinya kemewahan dan kesenangan orang hidup tiada ubahnya seperti impian belaka ajaran dalam kitab sudah tentu betul akan tetapi akan tetapi apa yang dapat kulakukan aku hanya dapat berdoa dan memohon semoga buddha yang maha pengasih memberkati lenghou toako selalu selamat dan supaya dia terikat jodoh dengan yim siocia hidup bahagia sampai tua selama hidup riang gembira jika selama hidup lenghou toako selalu gembira maka semuanya akan baik pula
3933542 hari sudah larut malam aku harus pulang hendaklah kau pun pulang saja
3933543 nenek bisu mengapa hari ini engkau tidak memandang diriku apakah badanmu kurang sehat
3933544 memangnya engkau tak bisa mendengar tapi aku tanya padamu sungguh bodoh aku ini
3933545 nenek bisu harap maaf daya ingat ing ing sungguh hebat dia masih ingat dandananmu maka dia telah menyamarkan diriku sehingga mirip saudara kembarmu
3933546 orang ini sungguh aneh aku menyamar sebagai dia dan kepergok olehnya rasanya aku tidak boleh tinggal terlalu lama di sini
3933547 maaf nenek cayhe berbuat salah biarlah kuganti pakaian nanti kudatang lagi ke sian kong si untuk minta maaf
3933548 selama hidupku sudah banyak menemui hal hal yang aneh tapi pengalaman sial seperti sekarang dijadikan kitiran oleh orang boleh dikata baru pertama kali ini terjadi
3933549 perempuan busuk perempuan keparat coba kau sejak mula kutusuk beberapa lubang
3933550 berkelahi terang kalah kalau aku tidak membalas dengan mencaci maki rasanya akan terlalu rugi
3933551 tapi kini aku tidak bisa berkutik jika dia tahu aku memakinya tentu aku akan disiksa lebih hebat
3933552 perempuan bangsat perempuan busuk sadar memang jahat makanya thian menciptakanmu menjadi bisu dan tuli tidak bisa tertawa tidak bisa menangis mirip orang gila sekalipun binatang juga lebih beruntung daripadamu
3933553 jika si nenek ini juga menggantung aku di atas pohon seperti put kay taysu dan lain lain lalu menempel plakat pula di atas tubuhku dengan tuduhan sebagai manusia yang paling cabul dan sebagainya padahal sebagai ketua hing san pay sekarang aku berdandan begini pula wah tentu akan malu besar untung dia menyeret aku ke sian kong si biarlah dia menggantung aku di sana dan dihajar asal tidak malu di depan umum masih mendingan
3933554 entah dia sudah mengetahui asal usul diriku atau tidak jangan jangan dia tahu aku adalah ketua hing san pay maka sengaja memberi layanan istimewa daripada yang lain
3933555 sebagai ketua hing san pay tentu dia akan mengingat orang sendiri dan takkan membikin susah padaku
3933556 dalam penyamaranku seperti ini jangan jangan dia tak mengenali diriku jika dia sangka aku orang jahat segolongan dengan thio hujin dan lain lain yang sengaja menyamar seperti dia untuk menjadi mata mata di sini dengan muslihat yang akan merugikan hing san pay wah bisa jadi ia akan memberi layanan istimewa padaku bisa runyam bila aku disiksa nanti
3933557 dia tahu aku ingin sekali membaca apa yang tertulis di atas kain tapi sengaja membikin aku tak bisa melihatnya kecerdasan nenek ini sungguh jauh melebihi orang biasa tapi hah lenghou tiong sudah terkenal sebagai pemuda yang bangor tentu apa yang tertulis di atas kain ini tiada kata kata yang baik bagiku buat apa aku membacanya
3933558 kalau aku hanya mencaci maki serabutan tetap tidak dapat menolong diriku sebaiknya aku mengerahkan tenaga perlahan untuk melancarkan hiat to yang tertutuk bila aku sudah pegang senjata tentu akan dapat mengatasi nenek itu aku pun akan gantung dia di tempat yang tinggi akan kugantung pula kain kuning pada lehernya lalu apa yang harus kutulis pada plakat itu nenek jahat nomor satu di dunia ini ah kurang tepat menyebut dia sebagai nomor satu di dunia bisa jadi dia malah akan girang biarlah kutulis saja nenek jahat nomor ke 17 di dunia ini biar kepalanya pecah memikirkan siapa lagi ke 16 nenek jahat lain yang lebih tinggi derajatnya daripada dia sendiri
3933559 bagus hari ini lenghou tiong benar benar telah menjadi hwesio ah tidak tepat aku memakai baju perempuan harus disebut menjadi nikoh
3933560 si buta nomor satu di dunia ini perempuan jahat yang bukan lelaki dan bukan perempuan
3933561 wah celaka kiranya nenek gila ini cuma pura pura bisu dan dapat bicara kalau tidak dari mana dia mengetahui makian put kay taysu padaku sebagai orang buta nomor satu di dunia ini hanya ada dua kemungkinan dia mencuri dengar ketika put kay taysu bicara dengan gi lim atau dia mencuri dengar ketika gi lim bicara padaku tadi atau bisa juga kedua kali dia mencuri dengar semua
3933562 sudahlah kau tidak perlu menyamar dan pura pura lagi kau bukan orang tuli
3933563 he jika kau mengganggu seujung rambutku saja tentu akan kucencang tubuhmu hingga hancur luluh
3933564 bukan saja seujung rambut bahkan dia sudah mencukur habis seluruh rambutku
3933565 mestinya tubuhnya dari belang menjadi hitam dari hitam menjadi putih dengan begitu habislah racunnya dan mati dengan sendirinya racunnya masuk dalam telunjukku untuk menjadi sempurna aku mesti menghabiskan seribu laba laba untuk mencapai puncak kesempurnaan aku harus menghabiskan lima ribu sampai selaksa ekor masih belum cukup
3933566 di satu pihak dia mesti dipelihara supaya dia dapat beternak
3933567 di kolong langit terdapat banyak sekali ilmu kepandaian mengapa mesti menyakinkan yang begitu beracun
3933568 memang amat banyak ilmu kepandaian di kolong langit ini tetapi tidak ada satu yang dapat melawan ciat hoe cioe ini
3933569 kau jangan anggap tenaga dalammu sudah mahir jikalau nanti aku telah berhasil melatih tidak nanti kau dapat bertahan untuk satu tusukan saja telunjukku ini
3933570 siapa mempelajari cian coe ciat hoe cioe ini setelah ia menghabiskan delapan ratus ekor hingga tubuhnya sudah penuh dengan racun romannya berubah dan setelah seribu ekor romannya akan bertambah jelek ibuku telah menghabiskan hampir lima ratus ekor ketika ia bertemu ayahku ia kuatir ayah tak menyukainya karena romannya sangat jelek ia terpaksa menghentikan latihannya kesudahannya ia menjadi wanita tanpa tenaga tenaganya lenyap umpama kata ia tak sanggup menyembelih seekor ayam benar ia menjadi cantik tapi iapun lantas dihinakan madunya serta kakakku ia tak dapat melawan hingga akhirnya ia membuang jiwanya maka hm apa gunanya paras elok
3933571 karena belajar ilmu ini romanku jadi jelek begini hingga laki laki tak berbudi itu tidak memperdulikan lagi padaku jikalau nanti pelajaranku selesai akan kucari padanya bila disisinya tidak ada lain wanita ya sudah saja
3933572 bukankah di antara kamu pun tidak ada janji ikatan jodoh hanya hanya
3933573 setelah sakit kakiku sembuh aku nanti pergi mencari daun obat obatan untuk mengobati bengkak mukamu yang beracun itu
3933574 aku telah menyiksa diri sekian lama baru kuperoleh kepandaian seperti ini apakah kau hendak memusnahkan kepandaianku
3933575 mungkin kita dapat memikir semacam obat memakai mana kepandaianmu boleh tak usah lenyap asal keracunan di muka saja yang hilang tak berbekas
3933576 bila ada semacam obat atau cara mustahil ibuku tak mendapat tahu kepandaian ini adalah kepandaian turunan kupikir yang bisa berbuat itu mungkin cuma tiap kok ie sian ouw ceng goe yang lihai ilmu pengobatannya hanya sayang banyak tahun dia telah meninggal dunia
3933577 adakah aneh untuk mengetahui dia nama tiap kok ie sian toh memenuhi seluruh negara siapakah yang tidak tahu
3933578 nona ini sangat baik terhadapku mesti aku balas kebaikkannya ini dia tidak tahu semua kepandaian tiap kok iie sian telah diwariskan kepadaku baiklah sekarang aku jangan membilang apa apa padanya hanya di belakang hari nanti aku dayakan untuk mengobati mukanya ini supaya dia kaget dan girang
3933579 aku jadi sebatang kara siapa juga tidak menyukai aku siapa juga tidak mau baik denganku
3933580 orang yang kucintai tidak perdulikan aku ia memukul aku ia pun mau menggigit aku
3933581 aku akan menikah dengan kau seumurku nanti akan perlakukan kau dengan baik
3933582 tidak dapat aku melupakan dia jikalau lagi sekali kau menganjurkan aku melupakan dia untuk selamanya aku tidak akan peduli padamu
3933583 tidak tidak demikian kau bilang kau suka menikah denganku bahwa seumurmu kau hendak perlakukan baik padaku senang aku mendengar kata katamu itu coba kau mengulangi sekali lagi
3933584 kau tidak dapat melupakan orangmu itu perlu apa aku bicara lagi
3933585 a goe koko jangan kau gusar aku mengaku bersalah kalau kau benar benar menikah denganku ku bisa membutakan kedua matamu dan mungkin juga aku akan mengambil jiwamu
3933586 sesudah kedua matamu buta kau tak akan bisa melihat lagi romanku yang jelek
3933587 kau tak akan bisa lagi memandang lagi wajah nona cioe dari goe bie pay yang cantik manis andaikata sesudah buta kau masih juga belum dapat melupakan dia aku akan membinasakan kau dan kemudian mengambil jiwa sendiri
3933588 nona cioe dari goe bie pay mempunyai hubungan apakah dengan kamu berdua
3933589 soehoe ia tidak dapat berjalan mungkin kedua tulang betisnya patah
3933590 dia mematahkan pergelangan tanganku tapi aku tidak mendapat luka di dalam
3933591 gunakanlah sikut kiri untuk membentur lengan kananmu tiga coen lima hoen di bawah tekukan lengan sesudah itu gunakanlah skut kananmu untuk membentur lengan kiri tiga coen lima hoen di bawah tekukan lengan dengan berbuat begitu rasa sakit akan berkurang
3933592 semua siluman dari mo kauw satupun tak boleh dikasih lolos
3933593 terhadap coe jie dia turun tangan sendiri suatu tanda bahwa ia memandang tinggi terhadap coe jie
3933594 kalau mau dengan mudah ia akan bisa membinasakan merpati yang ketiga mengapa dia diam saja
3933595 mo kauw sudah tahu rencana untuk mengepung dan membasmi kong ben teng surat ini adalah untuk meminta bantuan dari peh bie kauw
3933596 makin banyak mereka berkumpul makin baik lagi tak usah berabe mencari cari mereka di berbagai tempat
3933597 hm sombong sungguh nenek bangkotan itu belum tentu ia dapat melawan gwakong
3933598 mengapa kamu tahu bahwa enam partai akan membasmi mo kauw
3933599 hari ini untuk pertama kali kamu berurusan dengan orang orang agama siluman
3933600 mereka berempat hanyalah orang orang yang tidak ternama tapi sudah begitu beracun kalau bertemu dengan jago jago mo kauw apakah kamu masih bisa pulang ke go bie dengan masih bernafas
3933601 ceng hie kau sudah cukup tua tapi kau masih tetap sembrono kau masih kalah dari cioe jiak
3933602 enam partai besar mau mengepung dan membasmi kong beng teng
3933603 soehoe siapa manusia siluman itu kami harus mengenal dia untuk membalas sakit hatinya ceng hian soemoay
3933604 kalau tak salah dia adalah ceng ek hok ong yaitu salah seorang raja ong dari mo kauw
3933605 sudah lama kudengar bahwa ilmu ringan badan orang itu tiada bandingannya di dunia nama besarnya ternyata bukan omong kosong kepandaiannya banyak lebih tinggi daripada aku
3933606 hm dia sama sekali tak berani beradu tangan dengan soehoe dan terus lari ngiprit
3933607 aku tak dapat menyusul dia dan tak dapat menolong jiwa ceng hian
3933608 dialah yang menang siapa menang siapa kalah semuanya orang tahu nama enghiong diberikan oleh orang lain apakah kita bisa memberi julukan enghiong pada diri sendiri
3933609 apakah go bie pay akan hancur namanya di wilayah barat
3933610 mo kauw agama iblis memandang api sebagai nabi dan memuja api sebagai malaikat sesudah yo po thian beng coen kauwcoe atau pemimpin agama meninggal dunia
3933611 dari satu ke lain keturunan seorang beng coen kauwcoe memegang serupa benda yang merupakan semacam tanda kekuasaan benda itu dinamakan seng hwee leng tanda kekuasaan api nabi tapi pada waktu kauw coe turun ke tiga puluh satu memegang pimpinan entah bagaimana seng hwee leng itu hilang maka itu kauw coe kauw coe yang belakangan sudah tak punya tanda kekuasaan walaupun ia memiliki kekuasaan sebagai pimpinan tertinggi yo po thian mati mendadak entah diracuni entah dibunuh orang tak seorangpun yang tahu jelas dalam kalangan mo kauw lantas saja terjadi kekalutan sebab mati mendadak yo po thian tidak menunjuk ahli warisnya dalam mo kauw terdapat banyak sekali orang pandai sehingga yang pantas menjadi kauw coe sedikitnya ada lima atau empat satu namanya wi it siauw bergelar ceng ek hong ong
3933612 orang itu belum pernah datang ke tiong goan sepak terjang orang orang mo kauw aneh dan sembunyi sembunyi sehingga walaupun kepandaiannya sangat tinggi namanya tidak dikenal di daerah tiong goan tapi peh bie eng ong in tian ceng dan kim mo say ong cia soen sudah dikenal kamu bukan
3933613 keempat raja ong dari mo kauw adalah cie peh kim dan ceng ungu putih kuning emas dan hijau
3933614 peh bie seorang raja dan ceng ek pun seorang raja ceng ek berkedudukan paling rendah tapi kepandaiannya sudah disaksikan maka itu betapa tinggi kepandaian peh bie dan kim mo dapatlah ditaksir taksir
3933615 karena sakit hati kim mo say ong jadi seperti orang gila dan melakukan perbuatan perbuatan durhaka pada dua puluh tahun berselang dengan mendadak ia membunuh orang tidak berdosa sekarang orang tidak tahu kemana dia pergi dan menjadi sebuah teka teki dalam rimba persilatan mengenai in thian ceng sesudah gagal dalam merebut pimpinan dalam mo kauw dalam gusarnya ia mendirikan peh bie kauw dia sakit penyakit ingin menjadi pemimpin agama semula kita menduga bahwa sesudah meninggalkan mo kauw in thian ceng sudah putus hubungan dengan kong beng teng tak dinyana waktu menghadapi bahaya kong beng teng masih sudi meminta pertolongan peh bie kauw
3933616 menurut perhitungan usaha enam partai untuk membasmi kong beng teng pasti akan berhasil biarpun semua siluman bersatu padu kita tak usah merasa khawatir tapi dalam pertempuran pihak kita tentu akan menderita juga kerusakan besar maka itu aku berharap supaya kamu semua mempunyai tekad yang teguh untuk berkelahi mati matian sedikitpun kamu tidak boleh mempunyai rasa takut sehingga waktu menghadapi musuh kamu menurunkan keangkeran go bie pay
3933617 tinggi rendahnya ilmu silat seseorang tergantung kepada bakatnya dan segala apa tidak dapat dipaksakan
3933618 bahwa sebelum bertempur ceng hian sudah binasa dalam tangannya siluman itu tidak boleh ditertawai oleh kamu
3933619 huh huh tapi kalau sampai terjadi begitu akupun harus menerimanya dengan rela bukankah pada seratus tahun yang lalu di dalam dunia tidak terdapat partai yang dinamakan go bie pay
3933620 kalau ceng ek hok ong datang peh bie eng ong dan kim mo say ong dan mungkin akan datang juga cie san liong ong dan kelima ciang kie soe pun bisa turut datang menurut rencana semula paling dulu keenam partai besar akan membinasakan kong beng soe cia yo siauw dan susudah itu barulah kita membasmi siluman siluman lainnya tak dinyana hitung hitungan sin kie sianseng dari hwa san pay kali ini melesat jauh haha semua salah
3933621 sepanjang keterangan sesudah gagal menduduki kursi kauw coe dia pergi ke luar lautan dan memetuskannya hubungan dengan mo kauw alangkah baiknya bagi pihak kita bila dia masih mempertahankan sikapnya itu di antara keempat raja dalam kalangan mo kauw ia menduduki tempat yang paling tinggi sehingga dengan sendirinya dia merupakan musuh yang berat dalam mo kauw terdapat dua orang kong beng soe cia di samping yo siauw masih ada seorang su cia lainnya semenjak dahulu ada kong beng soe cia kiri dan kong beng soe cia kanan dan kedudukan kedua orang lebih tinggi daripada keempat hu kauw hoat ong yo siauw adalah kong beng coe soe kong beng soe cia kiri tapi she dan nama kong beng yo soe kong beng soe cia kanan tak pernah dilihat siapa jua kong bun dari siauw lim pay dan song wan kiauw song tayhiap adalah orang orang yang berpengelaman sangat luas tapi merekapun tak tahu siapa adanya kong beng yo soe itu sekarang tujuan kita adalah menyerang yo siauw dalam pertempuran berhadapan sepala apa akan diputuskan oleh kepandaian ilmu silat dari kedua belah pihak yang sangat dikuatirkan olehku ialah waktu kita menghajar yo siauw diam diam kong beng yo soe melepaskan anak panah gelap
3933622 yo siauw telah mencelakakan ki siauw hu wi it siauw telah membinasakan ceng hian
3933623 permusuhan antara go bie pay dan mo kauw adalah permusuhan yang sangat mendalam go bie dan mo kauw tidak dapat berdiri bersama sama dalam dunia ini murid mana yang akan menjadi ahli waris go bie pay akan diputuskan dalam pertempuran yang akan datang andaikata ada seorang murid lelaki yang tanpa menghiraukan keselamatan jiwa sendiri secara kebetulan bisa membinasakan salah satu hu kauw hoat ong maka aku aku bersedia untuk melanggar kebiasaan kita yang sudah berjalan hampir seratus tahun lamanya
3933624 semenjak kwee couwsu yang mendirikan partai kita ciang boin dari go bie pay selalu dipegang oleh seorang wanita
3933625 jangankan laki laki sedang wanita yang sudah menikahpun tidak dapat menjadi ciang cun jin akan tetapi pada waktu partai menghadapi bahaya besar aku tidak dapat mengkukuhi lagi kebiasaan lama sekarang siapa saja tak perduli lelaki atau perempuan yang berjalan besar akan menjadi ahli waris partai kita
3933626 dengan memimpin saudara saudara seperguruan dan murid murid turunan ketiga yang semuanya berjumlah tiga puluh dua orang toa suheng boanpwee sudah tiba di tepi it sian hiap atas titah toasuheng boanpwee datang kemari untuk menyambut kalian
3933627 ternyata rombongan bu tong pay yang datang lebih dulu apakah kalian sudah bertempur dengan pihak siluman
3933628 sudah tiga kali kami kebentrok dengan rombongan dua bendera bendera bok dan bendera hwee
3933629 kami berhasil membinasakan beberapa siluman tapi citsutee boh seng kok juga terluka
3933630 sepanjang pendengaran peh bie kauw kiu tok hwee dan lain lain cabang mo kauw datang membantu
3933631 kata orang cie san liong ong dan ceng ek hok ong juga datang kemari
3933632 sesudah berjalan jauh kau mestinya sudah lapar lebih baik makan dulu
3933633 in liok hiap aku ingin mencari keterangan mengenai seseorang apa boleh
3933634 bolehkah aku mendapat tahu she dan nama yang mulia dari siauw soemoay hal apa yang mau ditanyakannya
3933635 aku malah lawan mereka dan telah ditangkap oleh mereka sekarang aku menjadi tawanan nikouw tua itu

3933637 pertanyaanku adalah ini apakah suhengmu thio cui san thio ngohiap juga datang di it sian hiap
3933638 aku ingin mencari tahu apakah putera thio ngohiap yang bernama boe kie juga datang kemari
3933639 thio ngohiap sudah meninggal dunia kalau begitu dia sudah yatim piatu

3933651 let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these
3933652 let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these i tell you the truth anyone who will not receive the kingdom of god like a little child will never enter it
3933653 repent then and turn to god so that your sins may be wiped out that times of refreshing may come from the lord
3933654 therefore since we are gods offspring we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone an image made by mans design and skill
3933655 they are a people whose hearts go astray and they have not known my ways
3933656 lord are only a few people going to be saved
3933657 make every effort to enter through the narrow door because many i tell you will try to enter and will not be able to once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door you will stand outside knocking and pleading sir open the door for us
3933658 but he will answer i dont know you or where you come from
3933659 then you will say we ate and drank with you and you taught in our streets
3933660 but he will reply i dont know you or where you come from away from me all you evildoers
3933661 there will be weeping there and gnashing of teeth when you see abraham isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god but you yourselves thrown out people will come from east and west and north and south and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of god indeed there are those who are last who will be first and first who will be last
3933662 enter through the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction and many enter through it but small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and
3933663 you havent read your bible for six months and youre arguing and disagreeing with me about the truth ive been explaining
3933664 love the lord your god with all your heart soul mind and strength the second is this love your neighbor as yourself there is no commandment greater than these
3933665 all these i have kept since i was a boy
3933666 go sell everything you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me
3933667 how hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of god
3933668 children how hard it is to enter the kingdom of god it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
3933669 with man this is impossible but not with god all things are possible with god

3933674 if somebodys not a team player individuals will try to remove them from the team and the disruptive physician policy is one mechanism by which that can be done

3933677 go home to your family and tell them how much the lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you
3933678 and god raised us up with christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in christ jesus in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace expressed in his kindness to us in christ jesus for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this not from yourselves it is the gift of god not by works so that no one can boast
3933679 i heard you place a curse on the person who stole 1 100 pieces of silver from you well i have the money i was the one who took it

3933707 when you get on a roll like we did you have a pretty good idea why youre running good

3933709 i think kasey is learning life that its not all roses
3933710 sometimes there are some thorns in the bush we got one of the thorns stuck in us last year
3933711 hes coming to terms with the fact that hes such a talented driver that as long as he keeps his confidence up and kind of rolls with it that he realizes that it all comes back around hes such a good driver that when we started giving him good equipment again hes going to run good
3933712 it was a little bit loose all day the pit calls were great for fuel mileage things worked out for us we kept it on the track and we got a top 15 finish
3933713 thats a big part of why were where we are we finish races weve done everything we could to get the most points on that day it would be nice to have a teammate up there but we dont we still have things that we can learn from our teammates that we can go over and kind of throw off of each other but at the end of the day weve been more consistent then they have been
3933714 weve been doing the right things and our cars are running good
3933715 i think the 18 is having an extraordinary year and well probably all catch up with him
3933716 theyre having a great season theyre doing a lot of things right a lot of things are falling their way
3933717 i think those guys are good but once we get into the chase well see which teams are the top teams

3933727 the white population is older and very much centered around the aging baby boomers who are well past their high fertility years
3933728 the future of america is epitomized by the young people today they are basically the melting pot we are going to see in the future
3933729 my tomatoes grow from the soil with no additives those from the eu are picture perfect as if made by michelangelo but mine are better and tastier and you can eat them as they come no chemicals
3933730 that is why i plan to increase hectares under apples medicinal herbs and vegetables in the next two years
3933731 we cannot be a major exporter we cannot compete with others in terms of quantity or price we must look for particular market niches for our indigenous products wine cheese plum brandy and to sell our home grown food to tourists
3933732 the problems are small and fractured estates old and uneducated population dated technology poorly developed market infrastructure unfortunately croatia has never had a farming strategy to address those issues
3933733 they did not find it profitable to work the land and there were no punitive measures for keeping the land unused so it just lay there
3933734 and prepare for the competition once the market is fully open
3933735 but the huge german cheese market for example has only two percent of goat cheese so i do see a big chance to sell our products abroad
3933736 our vegetables are perhaps a bit more pricey but they are home grown freshly picked untreated with chemicals buyers always prefer our own products
3933737 we know we dont produce enough and well always have to import but we want to increase exports to improve the balance
3933738 the eu has lower subsidies for wine therefore it will be a shock which we want to overcome by encouraging people to invest in technology and new vineyards and focus on quality though there is not much time left
3933739 our wine makers face uncertain times with the eu membership but some of them could really benefit the eu has 500 million people so we should find a place there is always room for original local varieties of wine
3933740 as far as red wine goes i would not dream of competing with spain
3933741 weve been getting calls from neighbors and people driving by theres a dog trapped on the island
3933742 the geese are very wary of them then eventually they figure it out
3933743 theyre very striking when you first come upon them i could see how it would be for someone driving by at 70 miles per hour

3933748 finally an adult who trusts me and loves me enough to tell me the truth
3933749 they need to be accountable and im going to make them accountable one way or another
3933750 i dont think were really looking at taking any action against mr small and i need to emphasise that mr small has actually done nothing wrong and the horse is a victim of unfortunate circumstances here
3933751 but it does present a risk and our priority is to remove that risk
3933752 this is the only living animal ever thats beat the virus
3933753 based on medical advice that it was too big a risk for people that would be looking after the horse

3933756 russia has lost more airplanes than in any conflict of this scale since 1939

3933758 there were many reports that russian tanks are inside georgia which later proved out to be totally untrue
3933759 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
3933760 weve seen this in the past before in motorolas razr line it was a very big seller but the first version of that phone had rf radio frequency problems they had to recall it fix it and put it back out there
3933761 it could end up drawing more power because now the phone thinks its getting a worse signal than it actually is when it goes to talk to the network it speaks louder than it needs to
3933762 i block that out of my mind i dont worry about that
3933763 hes just an incredible athlete and i wish him the best
3933764 we actually hung out a little bit this offseason at some different events
3933765 were fine we talk like normal people we dont worry about the comparisons
3933766 hes going to be great in this league all the best to him
3933767 i know im far from it i know theres a lot of hard work focus determination and patience involved you have to go out there and continue to work your way through it
3933768 i dont because when i look back on it there were a lot of things that were left on the field that could have been better and that could have helped me out and could have helped the team out
3933769 es gibt auch eine andere welt angesichts der olympischen hochglanzfassade
3933770 bei uns im dorf gibt es einen wasserfall der alle vier tage vollst ndig gereinigt wird und dann schrubben die leute da als trainierten sie f r den curling wettbewerb bei den winterspielen
3933771 nur gegen die eine million die von diesem system profitiert
3933772 es hei t ja hier versammelt sich die jugend der welt und diese jugend hat viel damit zu tun ihre eindr cke bei den spielen zu verarbeiten
3933773 ich glaube ich suche jetzt erst mal ein bisschen privatleben
3933774 es ist ein traum dass sich hier der kreis schlie t
3933775 nein heute lieber auf englisch ich bin noch zu angespannt mein chinesisch w re nicht gut
3933776 sie verliert meistens gegen mich das ist ihr am ende wohl eingefallen und da ist sie nerv s geworden
3933777 eine olympische goldmedaille ver ndert das leben eines jeden athleten nichts wird mehr so sein wie vorher
3933778 ich werde jetzt ein bisschen urlaub machen aber dann werden sie mich wieder hier in beijing sehen
3933779 wenn jemand unseren sport nach vorn bringt nutzt mir das doch auch
3933780 aber jetzt sind wir beide olympiasieger und weltmeister vielleicht kann ich ihm jetzt auch mal einen rat geben
3933781 da hat man eineinhalb jahre hart gearbeitet und bei der team wm berragend gefochten da bricht schon eine welt zusammen
3933782 immer diese pl tze f nf bis acht ich kann es nicht mehr sehen
3933783 i have one eye looking very closely at developments back home i speak to people i have family there but im not going to rush anything
3933784 ive been here a long time i have a family here and its not just a case of upping and leaving and going back theres a lot to take into account i know a lot of zimbabwean professionals who are in a similar situation
3933785 i need to be able to go back and set myself up with a job that allows me to provide for my family both my immediate family and the extended family and that is not going to happen overnight
3933786 political stability is essential and other things will fall into place after that but it will take time
3933787 right now the risk takers are already taking up positions
3933788 even the regular man on the street in zimbabwe right now is very entrepreneurial he has to be or otherwise he wont make enough to survive i think that entrepreneurial spirit is going to be carried forward and so people will have to be sharp
3933789 a lot of colleagues and professionals living here in england have already developed their networks back home for me it wouldnt take me more than a few months to go back even if it might take five years for the situation to really turn around or even for the exchange rate to stabilize
3933790 there are many many people who would want to return and contribute to the rebuilding of zimbabwe but there is still uncertainty and a lack of clarity about what role the diaspora would play
3933791 there are people who have been tortured raped people whose families have been killed do they want to return right away without knowing if there will be justice
3933792 i think many people will wait to see how the situation develops to make sure that there is no longer violence that inflation has gone down perhaps it will be one or two years
3933793 i think you will see zimbabweans making new ties testing the water to go back but not leaving everything theyve got here because they cant afford to go back and lose everything
3933794 il bello dellessere ottimisti il vedere il bicchiere sempre mezzo pieno anche dopo che una troia se l scolato

3933800 jon yeah the triabloggers are cowards easier to deal with uncomfortable criticism by huffing puffing and banning
3933801 jon touchstone and i have all been banned from triablogue me with regard to paul manatas specific postings not because we were belligerent or offensive or rude but because they hate apostates and skeptical questioners just like their calvinist god does or so they claim
3933802 and if youre asking touchstone to answer you then i think it behoves you to state below that he can comment here
3933803 oh one last thing i challenge triabloguers to consider the respectful way we at dc treat our opponents to the way you treat yours

3933842 our top 15 brands which represent approximately 70 of sales performed particularly well over the past two fiscal years with a compound annual growth rate of 12 driven by continued double digit increases in r amp d and marketing investment against our tightly focused brand portfolio
3933843 we launched hundreds of successful new products during the past two years one of our more successful innovations was plastic snap pot beans in the uk

3933936 the roots of the 1969 woodstock festival all star backstory panel discussion and soundout
3933937 we didnt have an envelope big enough to fit that festival
3933938 i feel honored to participate in the soundout celebration this saturday
3933939 although the original woodstock music amp arts festival took place in bethel woodstock planted the seed and continues to foster a plethora of creative musical talent
3933940 some of the picnics and parties were really cool those were the things i remember the most
3933941 but obviously i was never involved in any shootouts or anything
3933942 when angela davis was fleeing california my mother was one of the
3933943 we came out of a classic hip hop tradition which the black panther party had a huge influence on brand nubian public enemy krs one that whole era
3933944 we wanted to reach out from the traditional quannum base into some other areas to see if we could expand the notion a little bit
3933945 if youre a good artist but nobody knows who you are and we put your record out through quannum people are going to take notice of you
3933946 is that it was sort of dehumanizing it was a closed casket and the ceremony was kind of generic a young vibrant person had been reduced to a box
3933947 he braved the booby trapped areas repeatedly in treating his
3933948 he was sort of country and he wasnt a natural athlete but he was strong and he was a hustler he always put out on the field and the coaches liked that
3933949 i entered the great lakes illinois boot camp in october of 1968
3933950 knowing i couldnt swim but it was either the navy or the army and if you went into the army you knew where you were going
3933951 was jump off a platform 20 feet above the water i was fighting for my life knowing i couldnt float after a few frantic moments a young marine offered me a pole to grab unfortunately it was only to be pushed back in
3933952 they told me that if they could not put me on a ship they could not use me and if i couldnt swim they couldnt put me on a ship
3933953 im convinced to this day that my dad pulled some strings for me
3933954 because i shot up that list and was called to join he
3933955 i had my swearing in at the army navy store in a back room on my way home i stopped to get my mail and there was my induction notice it was a close call
3933956 vietnam didnt make any sense to me just like iraq doesnt make any sense to me
3933957 i can see how they vietnam and iraq are similar
3933958 but the war on terrorism is the bigger picture the threat of global terrorism the younger generations dont seem to comprehend that the usa could cease to exist as we know it if we let our guard down
3933959 i cried then and am crying now thinking about those memories
3933960 asked me to help him write home to his mom and dad to let them know of the extent of his injuries he had lost his sight and was unable to write for himself he had been telling his family that he was fine in order for them not to worry but he was going home soon and felt they should know about his blindness i wrote the letter for him
3933961 this saturday aug 2 we would have celebrated chets 66th birthday with him at the great american music hall some of you would have shared a meal with him at lefty odouls alas chets ashes are stashed at the columbarium but that wont stop us from celebrating our brother
3933962 chet was loving and giving and music is what kept him livin
3933963 chet helms was born in texas and hitch hiked with janis she always
3933964 i remember him and my pops smokin on chops around the table and
3933965 he was good friends with my mother and he was like a brother to my
3933966 but chet was loving and giving and music is what kept him livin so were all here to give honor and respect to a man that gave the hippies a reason for wishin for peace and love and to shine bright like the stars above and i to be free like a dove one love chet helms
3933967 it was the little cool store we didnt call them independent stores back then but thats what it was
3933968 but the best part of a store like that had nothing to do with its size it was the kind of place where the people knowledgeable in music could tell you what was new
3933969 i tried to make the place presentable too not like some of these really funky little stores it was clean like a corporate store but stocked like an indie
3933970 did you see that movie high fidelity the way they made wisecracks about the customers i didnt want to have that happen in morninglory
3933971 when i managed the i v store youd have somebody coming in every two weeks who said they burned the bank
3933972 what i liked about it was that it seemed like such a santa barbara place
3933973 people behind the counter with long hair always very helpful without pressuring you i loved going in there
3933974 in the 90s i used to go in there every day after work the stock was vibrant back then
3933975 it was fun and people liked it then about a year ago the rumors started going around that the place was going out of business
3933976 and we had a show and it was christmas and there were only a few people there and suddenly i realized how bad things had become
3933977 people in the age group of 18 to 25 just arent buying music anymore
3933978 what people euphemistically call file sharing i call file stealing
3933979 it really amounts to the distribution and receiving of stolen property
3933980 they find out about cds there then go home and download them
3933981 its a shame that it had to end like this
3933982 its sad because ill miss having knowledgeable people available people who were so happy to be lucky enough to work in a record store these are places like galleries or restaurants where people gather those are feelings that are lost and i dont think you can get them back from a computer
3933983 when we cannot find contentment in ourselves it is useless to seek it elsewhere
3933984 happiness and contentment may sound like the same thing but theres a difference
3933985 we are not to make the ideas of contentment and aspiration quarrel for god made them fast friends a man may aspire and yet be quite content until it is time to raise and both flying and resting are parts of one contentment
3933986 by the time we got to woodstock we were half a million strong and everywhere was a song and celebration
3933987 it has a 49 stake in tom online a chinese mobile internet company similar to skype ebay does not yet have plans to acquire all of gmarket to boost its presence in asia and fuel growth the auction site plans to acquire a 36 4 stake in korean e commerce giant gmarke electronic commerce giant ebay is stepping up overseas expansion efforts making good on pledges that it would use a growing cash pile to fuel growth san jose based ebay plans to acquire a minority stake in asian e commerce giant gmarket worth 404 million as of aug 12 buying the stake would help ebay with a long held aim to widen its beachhead in asia like many u s companies ebay has repeatedly tried to extend its success in the u s and europe to asia where businessweek com 6 28 06 the move may also help ebay counter competition for asian e commerce from yahoo yhoo which purchased a 10 stake in gmarket in 2006 and has a 40 stake in the alibaba group the parent company of chinas largest e commerce company
3933988 this is the second time ebay has purchased a large minority stake in an asian company it has a 49 stake in

3933991 have no fear of bush and cheney cause theyre gone in 2009
3933992 they say san francisco is a good place to go crazy because no one will notice
3933993 i cant help them with their problem they cant see me i can be like 68 years old and im still trouble because theyre thinking about something in vietnam or theyre thinking about jane fonda or they think i slept with their daughter they think i burned my draft card its like a big rorschach of things that i did or did not do
3933994 i think that denver officials would be well advised not to believe everything that the fbi warns them about
3933995 thats how things can get out of hand due to fabricated exaggerated projections about violence or protest
3933996 what you saw in 2000 was the claim that 75 000 anarchists were descending the secret funding of permanent police equipment the denial of permits for protesters you saw the same thing in 2004 you will see the same thing in 2008
3933997 i planned for multiple scenarios not knowing which one would play out
3933998 but certainly after the murder of kennedy coming on the murder of king to me it was in the air that we were going to be busted and face serious harm unless we surrendered and left the city and simply went along with the plan just go along with our own disappearance
3933999 in evaluating this case you should bear in mind that your prime objectives should be to neutralize him in the new left movement
3934000 thousands of hairy yippies were going to have sex in public while drinking from the lsd laden waters of lake michigan they actually believed that and this sex in the parks on acid would occur at roughly the same moment that black revolutionaries would storm the convention with guns
3934001 named strangely enough in memory of chicago police killed by an anarchists bomb during a violent confrontation between police and protesters in 1886
3934002 it takes two for a riot to occur and if it wasnt for the fbi advisers chicago 68 would not have happened repeat would not have happened
3934003 i do think they are playing around unnecessarily with the rights of protesters to protest
3934004 it does seem to me theres a legitimate right to protest at stake
3934005 i dont think the protests will be very large if obama is the nominee i dont see the point in interfering with them its particularly crazy because most of the delegates at the democratic convention have been in many demonstrations themselves
3934006 the message was that the people coming to protest deserve this kind of repression if they get out of hand theyre just trying to scare the public into justifying more tax dollars for a false sense of security more gadgets for the police department
3934007 if they had given us permits i doubt there would have been much confrontation at all
3934008 what caused the rioting in the streets was the lack of permits and the lack of a place to stay too much order creates disorder is the way ive always put it
3934009 you dont have the draft you have one fifteenth of the american casualties now that you had at this point during vietnam the establishment is doing everything it can to keep this war from impacting the american people and yet people have seen through it
3934010 which i think means the ghosts of 68 are still with us people know a quagmire when they see one
3934011 all governments lie but disaster lies in wait for countries whose officials smoke the same hashish they give out
3934012 the american government and the american press have kept the full truth about the tonkin bay incidents from the american public
3934013 the process of brain washing the public starts with off the record briefings for newspapermen
3934014 dropped an iron curtain weeks ago on the antiwar speeches of morse and gruening
3934015 in this age of corporation men i am an independent capitalist the owner of my own enterprise

3934017 mccarthy is in a position to smear any government official who fails to do his bidding with such daring and few scruples mccarthy can make himself the most powerful single figure in congress
3934018 the most subversive force in america today is joe mccarthy no one is so effectively importing alien conceptions into american government no one is doing so much to damage the countrys prestige abroad if subversion is to be met by deportation then it is time to deport mccarthy back to wisconsin
3934019 a staff correspondent in little rock quoted the reverend wesley pruden the segregationist leader as saying the south will not accept this outrage which a communist dominated government is trying to lay on us this was my introduction to a regional journalism which prints such statements matter of factly

3934030 as we have been saying to you the transition and change that is happening right now is change that must first be addressed on the inner planes and include the larger spiritual picture
3934031 so what is the worst thing that can happen to any of you you die so what you must understand how true this is so what you die and then continue in another form what you are all afraid of is imagined pain so restructure your relationship to pain being cold or hot or thirsty or hungry or diseased or surrounded by death and fear are real fears for you we do understand this but from our vantage point these things are in fact temporary states and do not mean much at all your species is designed to think and feel very keenly about any kind of physical survival issue if you have little to protect then noone will come take it if they do give it to them if you are hungry then make room for more food in your home and then share it willingly with those that arrive on your doorstep if you have no more money then barter your gifts and time or sell something if you have little of value then you are lucky in many ways just use your minds to think out of the box and simply get food get water and get close to one another we have talked about this before if you fully understand that you are not alone even in the dark times ahead then you will continue to manifest what you need even in times of scarcity so here is a glimpse of the possible future shaping itself right now on the world stage yes the usa and the bush regime want to go to war with iran and is positioning itself in georgia for that purpose in order to do two things one is to derail the election in november and to create opportunity to take over territory that has oil available you could consider this move on the part of the usa like the armageddon you all talk about your rights as citizens will be impaired but they already are a sham in our opinion your american rights are an illusion your economy will collapse and in that you need to have some money and things to get what you need but you can get by with very little you must remember that this is supposed to happen there will be intervention from outside your planet so you do not destroy yourselves entirely this is a good thing your global crisis is a cosmic opportunity as for what to do now we have talked to you about gold as the wisest investment about investing in food and water accessibility and medicine for yourself and your family you need to trust your own instincts on where to live or be when this happens which will be soon whatever structure or system you have used to invest money in or hold your assets for you reconsider them and make your money available and not tied to stocks or banks or mortgages life is changing death is a part of life and this is an entire transformation for your planet you can be joyful in this even if your were to die or become ill or loose everything continue to find the opportunity in it all continue to laugh do what you can from where you are make sure you evaluate your motives for anything from your highest intuition and your heart do not make decisions from fear but from feeling informed and strong in your decision your mind is not reliable because it cannot grasp the complexity of the moment and is only concerned with physical survival keep yourself aware of what is going on without crossing over into fear or overload continue to meditate on how you want to be during these times do all this in the company of one another

3934065 we expect you to buy every item on this list by the first day of school
3934066 it just started with a little trickle of smoke i almost felt silly phoning
3934067 an hour later the smoke was more and i didnt see anyone up there
3934068 i left it at that and an hour later it had burst into a ball of flames and i was starting to get a little more nervous and still nobody up there
3934069 shortly after that our private air show started with the planes dumping fire retardant but if they would have attacked it when i phoned at 8 oclock it wouldve been pretty easy to take care of
3934070 we sent crews up there but because of the terrain it was really hard for our crews to try and pinpoint where the smoke was coming from
3934071 gosling called like three or for times and we told dispatch we did have crews in the area
3934072 the problem also was that it was in crown land and we werent sure if it was part of our area or part of crown land
3934073 once they got up there by helicopter it made it really simple to pinpoint exactly where the fire was unfortunately by that time it was actually burning
3934074 right now its looking to be under pretty good control
3934075 we wouldnt consider it 100 per cent contained but we have a pretty good grasp of the fire
3934076 theyve got a helicopter flying over top dropping water on it
3934077 but if it does get out of control theres some houses down less than an eighth of a mile lower than the hill that could be threatened by the fire
3934078 right in the middle there the flames were probably 30 or 40 feet high
3934079 it was right in the bushes and thats what i was kind of concerned about
3934080 the coast regional fire service will be looking into the cause of the fire and the circumstances behind the area and how it got to that point
3934081 well thats me i guess a lonely beacon of restraint and self sacrifice in a squall of car crazies
3934082 the restraining order doesnt reflect on the merits of the case
3934083 anytime the state needs to shore up their case they can go down to the jail and round up some people that are willing to testify in any high profile case people with a charges pending against them and b information about the case come out of the woodwork

3934099 todays revelation that suspected terrorist aafia siddique was apprehended carrying a list of potential attack sites including a number of new york landmarks is a sobering reminder that new york remains a top target for terrorist attack
3934100 federal agencies and law enforcement officials must continue to be on alert and work together to keep our nation safe it is critical that we remain vigilant in confronting these threats here at home and abroad it further underscores the need for the department of homeland security to allocate the necessary funds to protect new york and its residents i will continue fight to ensure that new york has the tools and resources needed to continue the fight against terrorism
3934101 every time we have talked about homeland security monies and where they should go i have pointed out repeatedly you catch a terrorist anyplace in the world with a map its a map of new york city not a map of some cornfield in the midwest
3934102 we view all threats as credible threats and i dont know that we have enough information to determine in this case theres a lot of evidence that it is credible and ill leave that to the professionals but we take every single case and assume it is credible until proven otherwise
3934103 right before the 100 freestyle he said i do not think i can swim this one maybe i will just scratch

3934111 our family today still feels that the ruling just proves again that the justice system here in new orleans is still flawed

3934127 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3934128 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3934129 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3934130 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3934131 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3934132 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3934133 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3934134 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3934135 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3934136 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3934137 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3934138 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3934139 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
3934140 weve seen this in the past before in motorolas razr line it was a very big seller but the first version of that phone had rf radio frequency problems they had to recall it fix it and put it back out there
3934141 it could end up drawing more power because now the phone thinks its getting a worse signal than it actually is when it goes to talk to the network it speaks louder than it needs to
3934142 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3934143 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3934219 we have people in beijing who are meeting with ioc members during the olympics
3934220 there will be a vote in the fall of 2009 our effort is to be successful with that vote in getting baseball restored to the olympics in 2016
3934221 but that is a significant issue we play every day and commissioner bud selig has indicated an unwillingness to shut down the season but there are alternatives that are being discussed that could provide some comfort to the ioc in terms of quality of players
3934222 i think taking players off major league rosters would be a difficult scenario

3934302 not want ing to form a government that is made up of only one race
3934303 the government cant form with only one race because other races contribute too and one race cannot form government its impossible because even one race they are divided mca is divided mic is divided each has their own ideas and their own traditions different kinds of chinese different kinds of indians
3934304 in malaysia today he adds after a sombre pause we cannot call ourselves malaysians the government will never let us be called malaysians we are only malaysians when we go abroad here we are indians chinese malays
3934305 its impossible to go beyond race politics because then we will be one nation and this will lead to peoples power all people will come together as one then it is difficult for the government they can be toppled look at the philippines everyone thinks they are filipino first so they go out on the streets here it is divide and rule people are divided we are all different races every human being has emotional feelings but we depend a lot on race race is so big because the top politicians make it so they practice divide and rule

3934311 we do things because our forefathers told us so we dont question the purpose we dont ask of the politicians what is your real purpose what is your agenda
3934312 the idea of thinking alike must change the idea that we are all just race

3934320 as with any election in any democratic country there is debate sometimes heated there can be divisions sometimes fierce then people make their own choices and democratic politicians have to live with the outcome what matters most is that governments listen as well as lead and so i will work hard to create more of a national consensus following our national democratic conversation
3934321 we are listening i know there is discontent among some parts of our community i accept it is our responsibility as the newly re elected government of all malaysians to find practical solutions to ease that discontent to listen to grievances and to seek to remedy them
3934322 there is nothing to be proud of for we have done nothing on our own accord we have merely taken on the responsibility to look after the interest of the people and fight for the rights of the people the elections were nothing the real work begins today

3934329 some form of affirmative action that cuts across the races needs to be there to help those who really cannot compete on their own
3934330 i see the bn as a counterbalancing force against the pkr dap pas government if the latter forgets what it promised to do
3934331 no this is the peoples stand to show their stand not to give us a two thirds majority

3934522 its high time that we built a foundation of evidence for the trillions of dollars spent on health in america each year
3934523 review evidence and produce new information on how diseases disorders and other health conditions can be treated to achieve the best clinical outcome for patients
3934524 create a national entity charged with conducting research to determine what works in health care
3934525 only one tenth of one percent was spent to assess what works and what doesnt at the federal level only 15 million was directly appropriated to compare the effectiveness of health interventions and services people who purchase other goods anything from cars to computers use information to compare the value of the different products before they purchase physicians and patients deserve better
3934526 keeping it private would remove the potential for political influence on the development of national research priorities comparative effectiveness research will be more credible and more useful if it is done independently of political influence and with broad stakeholder input

3934536 by the same token the writers role is not free from difficult duties by definition he cannot put himself today in the service of those who make history he is at the service of those who suffer it otherwise he will be alone and deprived of his art not all the armies of tyranny with their millions of men will free him from his isolation even and particularly if he falls into step with them but the silence of an unknown prisoner abandoned to humiliations at the other end of the world is enough to draw the writer out of his exile at least whenever in the midst of the privileges of freedom he manages not to forget that silence and to transmit it in order to make it resound by means of his art

3934565 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3934566 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago

3934572 these particular issues werent considered as part of that end of war review
3934573 i guess the important point and what we should focus on today is very much the fact that the gallantry of these men but also of d company as a whole and all those involved is being duly recognised finally
3934574 when we look at bank profitability we find that australian banks are around the top of the international range he said
3934575 on the surface this could indicate a lesser degree of competition than elsewhere
3934576 but when we look a bit deeper it seems that an important reason for the high profitability of australian banks is their unusually low bad debt experience
3934577 this has been the result of the very strong domestic economy he said
3934578 it is also worth noting that other australian industries have been very profitable over this period
3934579 history shows that it is new entrants that drive competitive behaviour mr battellino said
3934580 it is also important that this information be in a form that is easy to understand he said
3934581 our view of recent events is that they are cyclical in nature rather than a permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when market conditions settle securitisation will pick up again he said
3934582 as such it would be premature at this stage to embark on proposals such as the setting up of new government bodies to support certain forms of financial activity

3934586 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3934587 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3934588 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3934589 unfortunately this may not be the end i understand there are more possibilities of similar announcements as some ig and other investigations are wrapping up we will deal with them as they come

3934595 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3934596 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3934597 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3934598 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3934599 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3934600 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3934623 the government of india finds deeply objectionable the series of remarks by the official spokesman and leaders in pakistan on recent events in the indian state of jammu and kashmir

3934625 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mindset that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past
3934626 it is not too late for pakistani leaders and spokesmen to desist from the course of action that they have recently embarked upon and we would urge them to do so forthwith
3934627 we are deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation in the indian occupied kashmir which is resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people and violation of their human rights

3934681 one week before the release of singh is kinng was simply crazy promotion press events screenings it was a mad 24x7 outing i am glad all of it proved to be worth it after all thats because once the film released it has been one long party from friday night itself there hasnt been a single evening on which we havent partied with friends

3934691 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3934692 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken

3934729 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
3934730 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3934731 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3934784 he is a man of known strengths the country knows his strengths

3934795 unfortunately we are forced to restate the very fact that the principal agreement reached on the ceasefire and the return of the armed formations to the places of their permanent dislocation is being permanently violated by the russian federation
3934796 despite the assurances from the georgian side that they have ended all military activities russian troops shot down a second georgian drone over tskhinvali earlier today
3934797 the tanks just rolled past us with their guns at the ready definitely looking like they were ready to engage
3934798 its the same scenes as we were seeing at the beginning of the conflict as far as the people here are concerned the politicians may be talking about peace but theres really no sign of it here

3934851 its the combination of the in class and out of class experience that makes students happy with auburn

3934866 empat tahun lebih aku menderita hebat di puncak ini tapi setan kecil itu sudah dapat mempelajari sinkang yang tiada tandingannya di dunia
3934867 tapi aku sudah memendamnya di dalam lubang besok saja aku membawanya kemari

3934869 dengan mengerutkan badan dan menggunakan sedikit tenaga aku bisa lewat

3934871 seorang koencoe memang tidak menaruh dendam aku pernah melakukan perbuatan yang sangat tidak pantas terhadapmu dan kuharap kau suka memaafkan
3934872 besok kita bersama sama mencari daya upaya untuk keluar dari kurungan ini
3934873 kawanan kera bisa keluar masuk dan kita pun pasti bisa
3934874 tapi tapi mengapa kau tidak coba meloloskan diri terlebih siang siang dan menunggu sampai sekarang
3934875 sebegitu jauh aku tidak berani coba keluar dari sini karena kuatir dihina orang lagi
3934876 tapi sekarang mungkin aku tak perlu berkuatir lagi di samping itu akupun ingin menengok thaysoehoe para soepeh dan soesiok
3934877 celaka sungguh sekali lagi aku diakali oleh bangsat tua coe tiang leng cabang itu dipegang olehnya dan pada saat aku hampir hinggap di atasnya ia lalu melepaskannya
3934878 mungkin tulangku patah karena aku terburu nafsu dan menggunakan tenaga terlalu besar badan setan kecil itu banyak lebih besar daripada tubuhku tapi ia bisa keluar masuk kalau dia besar akupun bisa sesudah mengambil kioe yang cin keng aku bisa mencari jalan pulang dari lembah itu perlahan lahan aku akan mempelajari isi kitab dan melatih diri sehingga aku menjadi seorang ahli silat yang tiada tandingannya dalam dunia ini ha ha ha ha ha
3934879 badan bocah itu lebih besar daripada badanku mengapa dia bisa aku tidak bisa
3934880 kau sungguh tolol kau sudah tahu coe tiang leng manusia licik tapi toh kau masih juga kena diperdayai boe kie kau memang pantas mampus diakali orang
3934881 kalau lapisan salju terdapat batu batu besar jiwaku tidak bisa tertolong lagi
3934882 tanpa bergerak paling sedikit aku memerlukan tempo sebulan untuk bisa berjalan lagi katanya dalam hati
3934883 tapi selama itu dari mana aku bisa mendapat makanan untuk menangsal perut
3934884 semua anjing tin cie sudah dibinasakan oleh coe pehpeh tapi sesudah berselang beberapa tahun ia bisa mendidik anjing anjing baru
3934885 malam ini aku aku keluar untuk memburu babi hutan yang sering mengganggu tanamanku
3934886 secara kebetulan aku bertemu dengan seorang wanita dan seorang pria yang sedang beromong omong di bawah pohon
3934887 piawko hayolah sebelum mati mereka melawan mati matian dan sudah membinasakan ketiga anjing itu
3934888 serangan cepat sehingga lawan sukar dapat menangkisnya dan kalau serangan itu gagal gerakan mundurnya pun tak kurang cepatnya sehingga musuh takkan bisa mengejar
3934889 kalau kau belum mati perlu apa kau rebah di situ
3934890 tentu saja lapar tapi aku tidak dapat bergerak dan menyerahkan segala apa pada nasib
3934891 bukan bukan begitu sebabnya adalah karena phia ini diberikan oleh nona maka aku merasa sayang untuk segera memakannya
3934892 bapak langit menjatuhkan hukuman kepadamu mengapa orang lain tidak dipatahkan tulangnya hanya kau seorang yang dipatahkan tulang betismu
3934893 sesudah empat tahun tak pernah mencukur rambut dan muka tentu saja mukaku kelihatannya jelek
3934894 sudah 9 hari aku menggeletak di sini sungguh untung nona kebetulan lewat di sini dan nona sudah memberikan kue kepadaku terima kasih banyak untuk kebaikanmu itu
3934895 sebelum meninggal dunia waktu ibu memperdayai pendeta siauw lim sie pada kedua matanya terlihat sinar yang seperti itu
3934896 tidak aku tidak akan merampas kue itu sudah jangan nangis hai kalau begitu kau hanya satu manusia dungu
3934897 tap aku ingat kepadanya bukan sebab itu aku ingat ibu sebab tertawamu sangat mirip dengan tertawa ibu
3934898 ia tidak tahu bagaimana cantiknya ibuku ia rupanya menganggap roman ibu sejelek romanku dan ia merasa tersinggung dilihat dari sudut ini ia memang pantas bergusar
3934899 benar benar kau sudah bosan hidup biar aku tarik kakimu
3934900 jika di dalam hati aku berniat mentertawai nona biarlah sesudah sembuh aku jatuh lagi tiga kali dan seumur hidup aku menjadi seorang pincang
3934901 kalau ibumu seorang wanita cantik mengapa kau membandingkan aku dengan dia
3934902 entahlah aku pun tak tahu sebabnya aku hanya merasa bahwa kau mirip dengan ibuku biarpun kau tidak secantik ibu tapi aku merasa sayang jika memandang parasmu
3934903 anak baik nah kalau begitu kau panggil saja ibu kepadaku
3934904 mengapa kau senang melihat aku coba beritahukan kepadaku sebab musababnya
3934905 aku tak dapat mengatakan secara tepat aku hanya merasa bahwa kalau memandang wajahmu hatiku tenang dan aman aku merasa bahwa kau akan hanya berbuat baik terhadapku bahwa kau tidak akan mencelakai aku
3934906 haa ha kau salah aku adalah manusia yang paling suka mencelakai orang
3934907 kedua mata giehoe dibutakan oleh ibu jie sam soepeh cacat karena ibu seluruh keluarga liong boen piauw kiok binasa dalam tangan ibu apa ia orang baik
3934908 kalau ibu masih hidup aku pasti akan menyintanya dengan segenap jiwa dan raga
3934909 sesudah aku berteriak kesakitan ia tertawa kegirangan apakah ia manusia yang senang mencelakakan sesama manusia
3934910 kemarin dulu kau telah memukul aku tapi aku tidak menaruh dendam
3934911 aku berani memastikan didalam hati kau mencaciku sebagai perempuan jelek perempuan jahat
3934912 tapi mengapa kau baru merasa senang bila sudah mencelakai manusia
3934913 bagaimana kudapat memperlihatkan rasa senangku jika aku tak bisa menyaksikan penderitaan orang
3934914 aku merasa sayang untuk makan kue ini yang dihadiahkan olehmu
3934915 siluman muka jelek tioe pat koay kau makan enak sekali
3934916 kusenang melihat cara makanmu kau agak berlainan dengan manusia lain tanpa mencelakai kau aku sudah merasa senang
3934917 rasa senang yang sejati adalah rasa senang yang didapat karena melihat orang lain merasa senang
3934918 biarlah aku berterus terang terhadapmu hari ini hatiku senang dan aku tidak mencelakai kau tapi di lain hari bila aku tak senang mungin sekali aku akan menghajar kau sehingga kau hidup tidak matipun tidak kalau terjadi kejadian itu jangan kau menyalahkan aku
3934919 sesudah lukaku sembuh aku akan menyingkir jauh jauh kau takkan bisa menganiaya aku lagi
3934920 kalau begitu lebih dahulu aku akan putuskan betismu sehingga kau seumur hidup takkan bisa berpisahan lagi denganku
3934921 siapa yang sudah menghina kau tunggulah sesudah kakiku sembuh aku akan membalas sakit hatimu
3934922 tidak ada orang yang menghinaku penderitaanku karena nasibku yang buruk karena salahku sendiri aku memikiri orang yang tak dapat melupakannya
3934923 dia sangat tampan tapi sombong luar biasa aku ingin dia mengikuti aku seumur hidup tapi dia tak mau itu masih tidak apa celakanya dia bukan saja mencaci tapi juga sudah menganiaya aku sehingga darah berlumuran
3934924 dia pergi jauh jauh untuk menyingkirkan diri dan aku sudah mencarinya kesana kemari
3934925 di dunia terdapat banyak sekali lelaki yang baik perlu apa kau memikiri manusia yang tak berbudi itu
3934926 lelaki itu hanya memukulmu satu kali tapi penderitaanku sepuluh kali lebih hebat daripada kau
3934927 aku sendirilah yang salah melihat kecantikkannya aku jadi seperti orang edan tentu saja aku bukan pasangannya dan akupun tidak mengharapkan yang tidak tidak belakangan ayahnya wanita itu telah menjalankan siasat busuk terhadap diriku sehingga aku sangat menderita
3934928 budak hina itu suka sekali memelihara anjing yang sering untuk mencelakakan manusia
3934929 dalam jarak ratusan li di sekitar tempat ini tak seorangpun yang tidak tahu
3934930 lukaku sudah sembuh dan akupun masih hidup akupun tak mau membenci dia lagi
3934931 mulai dari sekarang thio boe kie sudah meninggal dunia dan di dalam dunia tak ada manusia lagi yang tahu tempat bersembunyinya kim mo say ang cia soen
3934932 di kemudian hari biarpun aku bertemu dengan manusia yang sepuluh kali lihai daripada coe tiang leng aku tak bisa diakui lagi
3934933 aku mempunyai dua orang ibu ibu kandungku adalah istri pertama dari ayahku karena lama tidak punya anak ayah mengambil istri kedua ibu tiriku jienio telah melahirkan dua kakak laki laki dan seorang kakak perempuan sehingga ayah sangat menyayangnya belakangan ibu melahirkan aku sebab disayang dan juga sebab keluarganya berpengaruh jienio sangat sewenang wenang terhadap ibuku yang hanya bisa menangis ketiga kakak juga sangat jahat dan mereka membantu ibu mereka untuk menindas ibuku tioe pat koay coba kau pikir apakah yang harus diperbuat olehku
3934934 tapi ayah sangat memilih kasih dan ia selalu membenarkan jienio
3934935 karena tak dapat menahan sabar akhirnya aku bacok mampus ibu tiriku itu
3934936 ibu jadi ketakutan dan menyuruh aku melarikan diri ketika kakakku mau mengejar untuk menangkap aku ibu mencoba mencegah mereka tapi tidak berhasil untuk menolong jiwaku ibu segera menggantung diri sehingga mati coba kau pikir bukankah aku yang sudah mencelakai ibuku sendiri
3934937 walaupun kedua orang tuaku sudah meninggal dunia secara menggenaskan mereka sedikitnya mencintai satu sama lain
3934938 ayah dan ibu juga sangat mencintai aku ya kalau dibanding bandingkan penderitaan nona itu memang ribuan kali lebih hebat daripada pengalamanku
3934939 apa mulai dari waktu itu kau terus terlunta lunta sebatang kara
3934940 dunia sangat lebar dan aku bisa pergi kemanapun juga asal tidak berpapasan dengan ayah dan kakakku aku boleh tak usah berkuatir
3934941 sesudah sembuh kita akan cari toako pemuda itu aku mau tanya bagaimana sikapnya yang sebenarnya terhadapmu
3934942 kalau dia berani menyentuh selembar rambutmu saja aku pasti tak akan mengampuninya
3934943 hm paling banyak aku tertawa lagi dengan ditertawai olehku kau toh tak akan mati
3934944 nona aku bicara dengan setulus hati tak pantas kau mentertawai aku
3934945 karena melihat kau sebatang kara dan nasibmu agak bersamaan dengan nasibku sendiri yang sudah tak punya orang tua atau saudara maka tadi aku ingin mengatakan jika pemuda itu tetap tak mau memperdulikan kau biarlah aku saja yang mengawani kau biar bagaimanapun jua aku bisa menjadi kawan beromong omong guna menghibur kau tapi jika kau menganggap bahwa diriku tidak sesuai untuk berbuar begitu terserahlah kepadamu
3934946 orang jahat itu seratus kali lipat lebih tampan daripada mukamu celaka sungguh aku membuang buang tempo di sini dengan pembicaraan yang tidak ada faedahnya
3934947 ia sangat menderita dan segala sepak terjangnya yang sangat aneh harus dimaafkan
3934948 kau tentu merasa sangat penasaran di dalam hati kau pasti merasa sangat mendongkol bahwa seorang wanita yang sejelek aku masih berani menghina dirimu benarkah begitu
3934949 karena kau tidak begitu cantik maka begitu bertemu aku lantas saja merasa cocok denganmu kalau mukamu tidak berubah jelek dan masih seperti pada waktu pertemuan pertama kali
3934950 dalam pertemuan ini bengkak matamu lebih hebat dan warna kulitmu lebih hitam daripada dalam pertemuan pertama kali
3934951 roman muka yang didapat semenjak dilahirkan tidak bisa berubah ubah
3934952 aku aku dalam beberapa hari ini aku tidak berani berkaca
3934953 dalam manusia yang terutama adalah hati harus baik rupa adalah soal kedua ibuku pernah mengatakan bahwa makin cantik seorang wanita mungkin makin busuk hatinya makin suka menipu orang dan ibu menasehati aku supaya aku berwaspada terhadap wanita cantik
3934954 kau jawablah pertanyaanku dalam pertemuan kita pertama kali apa romanku belum sejelek sekarang
3934955 apakah ia juga seorang rimba persilatan yang sudah mengenali siapa adanya aku dan kemudian memberitahukan kawan kawannya untuk memaksa aku buka rahasia gioehoe
3934956 aku dan kau tidak mempunyai permusuhan mengapa kau mencelakai aku
3934957 kedua kakiku belum bisa bergerak dan keenam orang itu lihai semuanya
3934958 mungkin sekali si perempuan dusun pun mempunyai kepandaian tinggi biarlah untuk sementara aku berlagal menunduk dan pura pura meluluskan kemauan mereka dalam hal mencari giehoe sesudah sembuh aku bisa membuat perhitungan dengan mereka
3934959 kau mengatakan bahwa sebelum mati kau ingin bertemu lagi dengan dia untuk penghabisan kali
3934960 ha ha ha sungguh menggelikan kau dan dia sungguh pasangan setimpal
3934961 sebelum mati aku ingin bertemu lagi dengan dia sebab aku mau mengajukan sebuah pertanyaan sesudah mendengar jawabannya barulah aku bisa mati dengan mata meram
3934962 nona ada urusan apakah kau datang kemari bersama orang orang itu
3934963 aku ingin mengajukan sebuah pertanyaan kepadamu dan kau harus menjawabnya dengan setulus hati
3934964 kalau pertanyaanmu mengenai diriku pribadi aku tentu menjawab dengan seterang terangnya dan setulus tulusnya
3934965 tapi jika kau mengajukan pertanyaan yang mengenai diri orang lain maaf biarpun aku dibunuh mati aku tak akan membuka mulut
3934966 pertanyaan yang kuinginkan adalah ini pada hari itu kau mengatakan kepadaku bahwa kita berdua adalah orang orang yang hidup sebatang kara dan tak punya tempat meneduh oleh karena itu kau bersedia untuk mengawani aku sekarang aku mau tanya apakah pernyataanmu itu keluar dari hati yang tulus bersih
3934967 kalu begitu bukankah kau tak mencela romanku yang jelek dan bersedia untuk hidup bersama sama aku seumur hidup
3934968 soal jelek atau cantik tak pernah dihiraukan olehku manakala kau ingin aku mengawaninmu untuk beromong omong tentu saja aku merasa senang untuk mengiring keinginanmu itu
3934969 kalau begitu kau kau bersedia untuk mengambil aku sebagai istrimu bukan
3934970 lelaki dusun yang tua dan jelek seperti dia masih tak mau menikah denganmu andai kata kami tak mengambil jiwamu kau hidup teruspun tak ada artinya sebelum kami turun tangan lebih baik kau membenturkan kepalamu sendiri di batu besar itu
3934971 selama hidupku selain ayah ibu ayah angkat thay soehoe dan para paman siapa lagi yang pernah mencintai aku dengan setulus hati
3934972 jika di kemudian hari dia bisa memperlakukan aku secara pantas aku dan dia masih bisa hidup beruntung
3934973 dengan setulus hati aku bersedia untuk menikah dengan kau aku hanya mengharap kau tak mengatakan bahwa aku tak setimpal dengan dirimu
3934974 mulai dari detik ini aku akan mencintai akan melindungi kau dengan segenap jiwa dan raga tak peduli ada berapa banyak orang yang akan mencelakaimu tak peduli ada berapa banyak jago yang mau menghina kau aku pasti melindungimu aku bersedia untuk mengorbankan jiwa demi kepentinganmu aku ingin kau bahagia dan melupakan segala penderitaanmu yang dulu dulu
3934975 ah goe koko cobalah katakan lagi apa yang tadi dikatakan olehmu supaya setiap perkataan bisa diingat di dalam lubuk hatiku cobalah
3934976 dulu waktu aku minta kau mengikuti aku kau bukan saja sudah menolak tapi juga memukul aku mencaci aku merasa sangat beruntung bahwa sekarang kau bisa mengatakan begitu
3934977 ah goe koko aku merasa sangat berterima kasih bahwa engkau bersedia untuk mengambil aku sebagai istrimu kau tidak mencela aku seorang wanita yang beroman jelek hanya sayang semenjak bebeapa tahun berselang aku sudah memberikan hatiku kepada seorang lain dahulu saja ia sudah tidak memperdulikan aku kalau dia melihat keadaaku yang sekarang lebih2 dia tak akan menghiraukan aku ah setan kecil yang berhati kejam
3934978 dia sudah menyatakan bersedia untuk menikah denganmu dan kamu berdua sudah cukup lama membicarakan soal cinta
3934979 aku akan segera menemui ajalku andaikata tidak mati akupun tidak bisa menikah denganmu tapi biar bagaimana kata katamu yang diucapkan tadi sesudah aku mati janganlah kau membenci aku kalau ada tempo luang boleh juga kau mengingat aku
3934980 kami sudah meluluskan permintaanmu dan kau sudah bertemu dengan dia sekarang kau harus menepati janji dan memberitahukan di mana adanya orang itu
3934981 siapa yang tidak pernah mendengar nama soet leng siang moay yang tersohor
3934982 kalau kau mau tahu juga baiklah aku akam memberitahukan terang terangan
3934983 yang menyuruh aku membunuh coe kioe tin adalah ho thay ciong dari koen loen pay dan biat coat soethay dari go bie pay
3934984 binatang jangan kau harap bisa menyebar racun dan merenggangkan persahabatan kami
3934985 tak bisa salah lagi dia membunuh coe kauwnio untuk membalas sakit hatiku sebab aku memberitahukan bahwa aku sudah ditipu oleh nona coe dan digigit oleh anjing anjingnya nona itu celaka sungguh aku sama sekali tidak menyuruh ia membinasakan coe kioe tin aku semula hanya mengganggap dia manusia aneh karena romannya jelek dan nasibnya buruk tak tahunya ia bisa membunuh manusia secara serampangan
3934986 perempuan bau sekarang tamatlah riwayatmu tapi aku tak mau menghadiahkan kebinasaan yang enak kepadamu aku hanya mau memutuskan kedua tangan dan kedua betisnya supaya hidup hidup kau digegares kawanan serigala
3934987 jika kau memberitahukan siapa yang menyuruh aku akan membinasakan kau tanpa siksaan tapi jika kau membandel huh huh aku akan memutuskan kaki tanganmu
3934988 kalau kau kepingin tahu juga aku terpaksa bicara terus terang nona coe kie tin mencintai seorang pemuda dan seorang nona lain juga mencintai pemuda itu yang menyuruh aku membinasakan nona coe kieo tin adalah nona yang lalu itu aku sebenarnya sungkan membuka rahasia
3934989 pedangku seperti dipukul dengan semacam senjata rahasia yang sangat lihai
3934990 terus terang dia sudah kena ditotok olehku dengan it yang cie bagaimana ia masih mempunyai tenaga yang begitu besar
3934991 kau boleh menyerang lebih dulu dalam tiga jurus dan sesudah itu barulah aku membalas
3934992 tioe pat koay kau menipu aku kau mempunyai kepandaian yang sangat lihai tapi kau sengaja tidak mau memberitahukan kepadaku
3934993 kau tidak pernah memberitahukan kepadaku bahwa kau mengerti ilmu silat akupun begitu juga
3934994 benar juga kata orang siapa yang berbuat baik akan mendapat pemabalasan baik
3934995 jika aku tidak memikiri kau dan tidak datang lagi ke sini kau tentu tidak bisa menolong jiwaku
3934996 kalau aku tahu bahwa kau berkepandaian lebih tinggi dari aku aku tentu tidak merasa perlu untuk membinasakan perempuan she coe itu
3934997 aku sama sekali belum pernah meminta kau untuk membunuh nona coe
3934998 dia sudah mencelakakan kau dan aku membinasakannya untuk membalas sakit hatimu apa dengan bertnidak begitu aku bersalah
3934999 jikalau mereka satu demi satu harus dihukum mati mereka tidak bakal terbunuh habis pula ada orang orang yang berniat mencelakai aku tetapi di pandangan mataku mereka itu harus di kasihani seperti nona coe dia setiap hari dirundung kekuatiran hatinya terus berdenyutan dia kuatir kakak misannya tidak mau baik dengannya dia kuatir kakak misan itu menikahi nona boe orang semacam dia ada apakah senangnya
3935000 aku mau bilang sesuatu orang ada nasibnya masing maisng umpama kata ada orang berbuat tidak benar terhadapmu lantas kau bunuh dia itulah tidak baik
3935001 jikalau kau mempelajari ilmu silat bukan untuk membunuh orang habis untuk apakah
3935002 kiranya kau seorang kuncu sejati seorang yang sangat baik hatinya
3935003 ibu sering menertawakan ayahku yang dikatakan sebagai orang yang sangat baik hatinya yang menjadi seorang pelajar yang harus dikasihani sebab hatinya sangat lemah selagi itu bicara itu gerak geriknya lagu suaranya mirip dengan mu
3935004 langit ada di atas jikalau aku menggoda kau biarlah langit membunuhku dan bumi memusnahku
3935005 ah kiranya dia coe cie jiak yang aku pernah ketemukan di sungai han soei tay soehoe membawa dia ke boe tong san kenapa dia sekarang masuk dalam partai gio bie pay
3935006 thio boe kie telah mati sekarang ini akulah seorang dusun si can a goe yang sangat jelek rupanya asal aku tidak bisa menyamarkan diri mungkin aku bakal menghadapkan malapetaka yang tak ada habisnya tidak di depan siapa pun tidak dapat aku memperlihatkan diriku yang asli supaya ayah dan ibuku jangan berpenasaran terus di dunia baka
3935007 soecie kau itu sudah menghajar punggungku dengan kedua tangannya dengan pukulan toe chung bong hoa
3935008 dia memukul aku lantas tangannya patah sendirinya apakah waktu itu aku pasti disesalkan dan dipersalahkan coba kau tanya soecie mu apakah pernah aku membalas memukul dia sekalipun satu kali saja
3935009 kau bawalah dia berdua kepada suhu supaya suhu yang memberi hukuman kepadanya
3935010 jika mereka ini bertindak keliru bukan dengan sengaja menurut pandanganku baiklah urusan dihabiskan saja lebih baik kita menjadi sahabat sahabat
3935011 sekarang kau boleh bekuk budak itu kau patahkan kedua tangannya
3935012 maaf siaomoi berlaku kurang aja ingin ku menerima beberapa jurus
3935013 cioe cie jiak diharap nanti dapat mengangkat pamor rumah perguruan mereka maka itu sekarang ia memaksa sang soe moay menempur si gadis desa
3935014 jikalau aku tidak memperlihatkan jati diriku urusan sukar dibuat jelas tapi baiklah aku tetap jangan bicara
3935015 perduli apa dia cantik atau tidak apa kaitannya dengan aku aku justru menguatirkan kau aku takut kau nanti terluka
3935016 untuk apa aku mendustai kau aku hanya tidak menyangka dalam go bie pay ada nona demikian muda tapi ilmu silatnya sudah mahir sekali
3935017 dia tidak terluka sama sekali bahkan aku bilang dia hebat bukan ilmunya yang aku maksud tapi kecerdikannya selagi ia masih berusia demikian muda
3935018 memang tidak ketika tanganku mengenai pundaknya dari pundak itu menolak keluar aliran tenaga dalam yang membuat tanganku mental kembali jelaslah dia telah mempelajari ilmu kioe yang kang dari go bie pay dan membuat tanganku gemetaran dan kesemutan dia mana terluka
3935019 kalau begitu biat ciat soe thay menghargai nona itu dia rela menurunkan ilmu kioe yang kang dari go bie pay sedangkan ilmu itu adalah ilmu pelindung untuk partainya
3935020 melihat orang demikian cantik semangatmu terbang naik keluar langit aku bilang dia tidak terluka lantas kau jadi kegirangan kenapa
3935021 kau telah bilang bahwa kau telah bakal menikahi aku belum setengah hari lewat pikiranmu sudah berubah kau sudah kepincut nona lain
3935022 kau pun bilang bahwa di dalam hatimu ada seorang kekasih lainnya kau tak dapat menikah denganku
3935023 itu benar tapi kau telah berjanji padaku bahwa seumur hidupmu kau akan setia padaku
3935024 kenapa setelah melihat nona cantik kau tak ada semangat seperti ini melihat lagakmu ini bagaimana orang tidak mendongkol
3935025 aku larang kau menyukai dia aku larang kau memikirkan dia
3935026 tapi kau di dalam hatimu mengapa kau senantiasa mengingat seseorang lain kau mengingatnya hingga kau tidak melupakannya
3935027 sebab aku kenal orang itu lebih dulu daripada aku kenal kau coba aku mengenal kau terlebih dahulu pasti seumur hidupku aku selalu baik terhadap kau seorang tidak akan mencintai orang lain lagi ini dia yang dibilang ikut satu orang hingga akhir hayatnya jikalau satu orang mempunyai dua atau tiga pikiran tuhan juga tidak dapat menerimanya
3935028 aku kenal nona cioe jauh lebih lama daripada aku kenal kau
3935029 jikalau kau baik denganku seorang aku juga akan baik dengan kau seorang tetapi jikalau di dalam hatimu memikirkan orang lain aku pun dapat memikirkan orang lain
3935030 beberapa hari lagi kakiku sembuh kita berdua boleh pergi pesiar memandangi keindahan sang alam tidak baguskah itu
3935031 asal yang aku sanggup tentu aku akan melakukannya untuk kau
3935032 jikalau kau berjanji tidak akan gusari aku baru aku mau bicara
3935033 kau bilang di hatimu tidak gusar kalau di mulut bilang tak gusar
3935034 aku datang dari tionggoan yang berlaksa li sampai di wilayah barat ini maksudku ialah untuk mencari dia mulanya aku masih dapat mendengar sedikit kabar tentangnya lalu setibanya di sini ia bagaikan sebuah batu yang tenggelam dalam lautan besar sedikitpun tak kudengar lagi kabarnya maka itu kalau nanti kakimu sudah sembuh aku minta kau membantuku mencari dia sesudah itu baru aku menemani kau pesiar ke gunung dan sungai tidakkah ini bagus
3935035 kau sudah menerima baik kau sudah berjanji tidak akan gusar
3935036 jikalau nanti kita dapat menemukan dia dia akan berpikir bahwa aku telah mencari dia lama sekali dia tidak akan mengusir aku apa yang dia bilang aku akan melakukannya pendek kata aku akan turut segala perkataannya
3935037 mana dapat aku menerangkan goe koko aku tanya apakah kita dapat mencari dia umpama kata kita dapat mencari apakah dia bakal mencaci dan memukulku
3935038 asal hati manusia keras bagaikan emas di atas langit atau di dalam dunia pasti orang dapat saling bertemu
3935039 nona ini demikian tergila gila terhadap kekasihnya jikalau di dalam dunia ini ada seorang yang demikian memikirkan aku biar dalam hidupku lebih menderita lagi aku rela
3935040 jikalau tapak kakinya bin koen itu tapak kakiku dapat berjalan bersama nona cioe
3935041 hayo lekas mari kita pergi kalau terlambat nanti tak keburu
3935042 nona muda dari go bie pay itu tidak mau bertempur sama aku
3935043 ia berpura pura terluka tetapi lain dengan teng bin koen dia bilang dia mau menangkap kita untuk dibawa kepada gurunya itu berbahaya mestinya biat coat soe thay berada di dekat sini pendeta wanita bangsat yang tua itu paling mau menang sendiri mana bisa dia tidak datang kemari
3935044 bertemu itulah belum tapi dia ketua go bie pay dia bukan sembarangan orang
3935045 kau tidak mau memberitahukan namamu apa yang aku bisa kau menghendaki memanggilmu si nona jelek tapi aku merasa kau bagus dilihat
3935046 namaku bukannya coe dari tin coe yang berarti mutiara hanya coe dari tin coe yaitu laba laba
3935047 jikalau ayahku yang memberikannya kau pikir apakah kau kira aku suka menerimanya
3935048 ibuku yang memberikannya ibu mengajarkan ilmu silat cian coe cit hoe choe maka ia bilang aku baiknya memakai nama ini
3935049 sampai sekarang aku belum dapat menyempurnakan jikalau aku sudah mahir maka tak usahlah kita takut pula pada coat soe thay si pendeta wanita bangsat itu maukah kau melihatnya
3935050 laba laba itu ada yang belang itulah yang beracun sekali laba laba dengan sepuluh kaki ialah yang paling beracun tak ada bandingan siapa kena digigit dia tak akan ketolongan lagi
3935051 nona ini sangat cerdik jikalau biat coat soe thay menyusul kita setibanya di sini tentu dia bakal menyangka bahwa kita jatuh mati ke dalam jurang itu
3935052 apa kau takut merangkul aku keras keras hingga mati tercekik
3935053 kau merangkul begini pelan dan kakimu menjepit orang enteng sekali kau membuat leherku geli saja
3935054 gubuk untuk menempatkan seekor kerbau yang besar bukankah kau bernama a goe si kerbau
3935055 empat atau lima hari lagi kakiku tentu sudah sembuh banyak aku dapat berjalan meskipun dipaksakan
3935056 kau sudah jadi si jelek tidak karuan kalau nanti kaki kerbaumu pincang apa itu bagus dilihat
3935057 aku belum lapar kau boleh menunggu sebentar lagi kau terlalu letih
3935058 jikalau kau hendak memperlakukanku dengan baik kau harus sungguh sungguh baik
3935059 wanita itu makin cantik makin pandai dia menipu orang maka terhadap wanita cantik kau harus semakin berhati hati menjaga diri
3935060 aku mempunyai niat mengambil dia sebagai kawan hidupku tapi dia mempunyai pacar sendiri jadi tidak menaruh hati padaku
3935061 siapa berpura pura baik terhadapku mulutnya lain hatinya lain nanti kita tikam tubuhnya hingga berlubang
3935062 ah kau lebih tua dua tahun daripada aku mengapa kumismu sudah tumbuh begitu panjang
3935063 belum pernah aku ketemu orang maka itu aku tidak berpikir untuk cukur
3935064 asal aku menggunakan sedikit saja tenaga aku bisa memotong lehermu ini maka terbanglah jiwamu kau takut tidak
3935065 di dalam dunia ini apa yang bagus di dalamnya suka mengeram apa yang jelek burung merak begitu indah bulunya tapi nyalinya beracun jengger burung boo yan merahpun bagus sekali tapi racunnya bukan main demikian binatang lainnya seperti ular bagus dilihatnya tapi jahatnya berlebihan wajah tampan apa faedahnya yang penting hatinya baik
3935066 kalau aku mencelakai orang hingga hebatnya bukan kepalang hatiku barulah tenang dan girang
3935067 kalau bukan mencelakai orang apa gunanya aku belajar ilmu cian coe ciat hoe coe
3935068 kenapa aku mesti menyiksa diri hingga menderita tak habisnya apa itu untuk main main saja

3935075 i think georgian government in this case is being the aggressor but theyre pretending to be the victim
3935076 the guy to blame is the georgian government not russian who stepped into save innocent people
3935077 yes stepping in to save ossetians otherwise gonna be another genocide
3935078 i believe they will as long as georgians obey their part of the deal
3935079 georgian government made the decision to be the aggressor and even though right now they pretend to be the victim russia did have a choice either to go or not to go i believe they made the right decision
3935080 we have seen first hand how asbestos has wreaked havoc on americans working in naval shipyards automobile plants and the construction industry most often this is through their employers conscious choice for profits over a workers health
3935081 we have a very high percentage of baby boomers who will hit 65 in the next three or four years and then keep hitting 65
3935082 significantly underestimates the number of deaths because we dont actually take any other areas where air pollution does cause cancer in other areas of the body
3935083 that is a huge hit and huge burden upon our health care system
3935084 is it taking doctors attentions away from other issues that are otherwise being missed or ignored
3935085 the numbers to me were not a surprise they were consistent with others numbers id heard

3935087 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidante
3935088 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3935089 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3935090 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3935091 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3935092 they called and i didnt really quite believe it i was hoping i was still asleep and it was a dream but it was for real
3935093 im sure she wouldnt have gone into that situation if she had known nothings worth that
3935094 shes made a huge difference in the world already but i think its just a tragedy a stupid waste that she should be brought to a halt so violently and so soon she had so much that she was offering people
3935095 in the last two three years she travelled at least half a year maybe more and to many different countries her suitcase was sort of installed at the top of the stairs always being unpacked or repacked or en route
3935096 she knew what she wanted she would work hard to get it she didnt suffer fools gladly she had a mission and she took it very seriously she had a huge smile she really loved life she loved travelling she loved seeing different countries
3935097 ive spoken with staff in afghanistan she was terribly well regarded very very well regarded by the staff and by the afghan community as i understand it
3935098 she was very hard working utterly compassionate and committed to her work a real believer in humanitarian assistance
3935099 she was a smart committed talented young woman who went to a difficult part of the world where the needs are extensive to apply the skills that she had acquired over the years in her education and professional experience
3935100 she was courageous compassionate lovely brave hard working and utterly committed to what she was doing
3935101 she was very very good at her work she really was as good as it gets as a humanitarian worker and as an individual and we are heartbroken and utterly grief stricken by her loss
3935102 her energy cheerfulness generosity and critical mind will be sorely missed by her colleagues in education and the feminist community at mcgill
3935103 knowing the risks associated with working in a conflict zone these humanitarian aid workers gave selflessly to help improve the lives of the afghan people
3935104 their spirits will live on in the continued efforts of all who are assisting in the reconstruction of afghanistan
3935105 we think such a rise would reduce luxury car sales by around 20
3935106 we will do whatever we like and we dont want any one to criticize us
3935107 we are prepared to make these investments because we believe in the value of education we believe in the value of publicly funded education
3935108 and i believe that these proposed changes in the four year collective agreement are good for the system they are good for students and they are good for individual teachers
3935109 we will not sign a long term collective agreement with any school board that does not eliminate the gap

3935137 he runs the show and knows the game any game hed be a playmaker in anything he did
3935138 having coached a secondary you have a good idea of the picture you look for back there
3935139 ed is good enough to change the picture just a little bit
3935140 in other words he doesnt have to be positioned quite as deep or quite as wide or quite as tight as another guy would and still be in position to make the play you see why hes made so many plays over the years kind of by baiting quarterbacks a little bit hes got a real knack for that
3935141 we dont want robots on defense and we dont want the offense to know exactly what were in ed will move around eds always in the structure of the defense if hes not weve missed a call or something like that nothing ever has been intentional where hes been out of position i think what happens is people see him moving around and think hes free lancing
3935142 he knows the defense so well he knows the strengths the weaknesses of it
3935143 he knows what the offense is trying to do hes a great student of the game when that opportunity to make a play happens he makes it he doesnt drop it
3935144 he helped me get up to speed watching film and learning the game
3935145 this is a full time job so if you want to be great the film study is what separates you from the guys who dont do that stuff

3935149 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
3935150 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear
3935151 i have voted for members of both parties in the course of my adult life and as i said earlier i will vote for the candidate i think can do the best job for america whether that candidate is a republican a democrat or an independent
3935152 he has energized a lot of people around the world and so i think he is worth listening to and seeing what he stands for
3935153 he likes and admires john mccain and that would be a factor in anything he does if he decides to get more involved
3935154 and likes him and is looking for a reason to vote for him he hasnt found it yet
3935155 i will ultimately vote for the person i believe brings to the american people the kind of vision the american people want to see for the next four years
3935156 a vision that reaches out to the rest of the world that starts to restore confidence in america that starts to restore favorable ratings to america frankly weve lost a lot in recent years
3935157 signal that choice sends about the character and judgment of the candidate

3935176 we have seen first hand how asbestos has wreaked havoc on americans working in naval shipyards automobile plants and the construction industry most often this is through their employers conscious choice for profits over a workers health
3935177 weve worked extraordinarily hard to build a culture where every single day matters and that first day that first week does set a tone for what happens the rest of the school year
3935178 i am very grateful for the attention meeks has brought to this issue
3935179 but i think we can fight this battle and win this battle without doing anything that puts students on a course of behavior that is self destructive
3935180 on november 25th prodisk the tracking is already finished and were now mixing this beast of epic proportions

3935190 dont ever watch the news youre just going to be brainwashed
3935191 you have to do what you love to do not get stuck in that comfort zone of a regular job life is not a dress rehearsal this is it
3935192 life is raw material we are artisans we can sculpt our existence into something beautiful or debase it into ugliness its in our hands
3935193 i hope you get the chance to live like you were dying like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity to think about
3935194 life consists not in holding good cards but in playing those you hold well
3935195 it is not how many years we live but rather what we do with them
3935196 i went rocky mountain climbing i went 2 7 seconds on a bull named fu manchu and then i loved deeper and i spoke sweeter and i watched an eagle as it was flying and he said someday i hope you get the chance to live like you were dying
3935197 the essential conditions of everything you do must be choice love and passion
3935198 i was finally the husband that most the time i wasn
3935199 the tragedy of life is not so much what men suffer but rather what they miss
3935200 what is life it is the flash of a firefly in the night it is the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime it is the little shadow which runs across the grass and loses itself in the sunset
3935201 life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we would not dare to conceive the things which are really merely commonplaces of existence if we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the planning the cross purposes the wonderful chain of events working through generations and leading to the most outer results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable
3935202 i asked him when it sank in that this might really be the real end how
3935203 by praying i place in the hands of the lord the ministry he himself has entrusted me with and the fate of the entire church and civil community
3935204 truly many people write asking me to pray for them they share their joys but also their worries the plans for their lives but also the problems of their families and their work the expectations and hopes that they carry in their hearts together with the distress connected with the uncertainties which humanity is experiencing at this moment
3935205 i know well that the first service i can render to the church and to humanity is precisely that of prayer
3935206 one who prays never loses hope even when he finds himself in difficult or even humanly desperate situations
3935207 both ended their earthly lives with martyrdom in the auschwitz camp
3935208 but precisely in their martyrdom there shines forth the splendor of the love that vanquishes the darkness of selfishness and hatred
3935209 it is moving to note that the humble and trusting recourse to the blessed mother is always a source of courage and serenity
3935210 let us renew our trust in the one who from heaven watches over us with maternal love at every moment

3935214 maybe you can check it out in an art gallery someday
3935215 even better than what you were working on a few months back
3935216 i gave you my napkin after you spilled your drink then i asked to see your drawing even though i had been staring at it the whole time and then you left like i had offended you or something
3935217 see i like how you mad her seem like she matters i mean she probably does because of her attire but maybe she doesnt matter to her job maybe she doesnt even matter at all
3935218 her name is elizabeth my younger sister named her that
3935219 well be able to say more since some things are easier to write out rather than to say aloud
3935220 is actually transmitted by some wave like signal thats fast but not infinitely fast
3935221 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life
3935222 i know there might be wrong decisions that i make and there might be right decisions that i make but theyre decisions that i make for myself
3935223 and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 percent supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all
3935224 i think planning whats going to happen next year or this autumn is going to happen after this week right now all im thinking about is how am i going to play good this week how am i maybe going to possibly win this
3935225 im not going to think about the future right now
3935226 i kind of feel sad for the guidance that she seems to not have in the right direction if she wants to be a golfer she should really concentrate on being on the womens tour and dealing with them and learning to win
3935227 if i will come back in the future i guess time will tell
3935228 i never used the r word that gave me an opening but i dont have a timeframe i have a lot on my plate and im excited about the next chapter
3935229 i drove the ball really well off the tee also to be honest i missed a few fairways but when i did i made a few birdies even from the rough i am just comfortable at this place
3935230 i shot a good score today and i really put a lot of good swings on the ball but i want to go out tomorrow and forget about it and keep it going for all four rounds
3935231 i want to walk away from this week and feel good about my game
3935232 under siege with repeated gunfire loitering drug dealing and other general mayhem
3935233 show me how you do that trick the one that makes me scream
3935234 with our act composite scores increasing every year for three years in a row it seems to indicate that recent educational reforms are making a difference these scores demonstrate the importance of taking rigorous advanced coursework and im proud of the texas students who take on that challenge
3935235 we saw exciting and substantial gains posted by texas students this impressive one year growth shows that our students are increasingly prepared to succeed in college we still have a great deal of work to do to get all students ready for college and the work force but these results show that we are on the right track
3935236 the increase in college readiness in a single year is very significant this gain shows what texas educators and students are capable of we in higher education look forward to working closely with our k 12 colleagues to continue to improve educational outcomes for the students of texas

3935238 we promised to host the uks finest bill of metal in 2008 and with the addition of legendary uk acts like onslaught and benediction were definitely one step closer
3935239 i went to use it one night after patrol and an automated voice came on and said you have 55 minutes left for this call
3935240 i had barely used the card so i thought that was strange the thing is letters can take two weeks or more through mail where im based i dont have internet access or phone access every day so i can go three weeks without any contact
3935241 so when i can call home i dont want to worry about whether my call will go through or if i have enough minutes to talk
3935242 its happened on other cards shes sent me too i never get the number of minutes it says i get on the card
3935243 why cant at amp t just tell you exactly what youre getting
3935244 how is it that when you buy a 550 minute phone card your son or daughter is not even going to get half of that when they use it
3935245 the best value for soldiers are the at amp t prepaid phone cards that were designed specifically for military members the rates we extend are more competitive than you would see for commercial long distance
3935246 who wish to purchase these cards for our troops serving overseas in operation freedom and operation iraqi freedom
3935247 we do give a lot of minutes away for free to the military we work with aafes to educate buyers and we urge everyone to read the fine print on their cards carefully before they buy them we want to make sure military families are getting the best value for their money
3935248 we dont want to produce a card that is specific to iraq korea or japan good lord i dont think we could manage that
3935249 i continue to want us to be a diocese where many theological perspectives can be held in tension and the center of who we are is in christ
3935250 we have one more practice tonight but i think there is a little excitement in each and every one of us that two a days are over
3935251 we are still going to compete and work hard each and every day
3935252 practice was pretty grueling today we worked hard in the morning practice and it was a little cooler sometimes when it is a little cooler like today you get a little lazy but you have to push through it and be mentally tough
3935253 i wasnt upset with it i moved to linebacker in the spring because thats what the team needed and i was able to do that coach saban was impressed with the way i caught on ive always felt like i play a brand of football and he was happy about that he just felt like moving me back to offense i would have a chance to contribute more i worry about on the things i can control i can control how hard i practice and the effort that i put in and thats it
3935254 i was really impressed with last saturdays scrimmage i thought we did a good job of being consistent from start to finish as far as running the ball our front did really well we had some turnovers especially in the red zone that hurt us but whats great about that is its a scrimmage and its on film and we are able to learn from it youd much rather see those types of things happen in a scrimmage atmosphere versus a game we saw a lot of things that we can learn from in order to get where we want to be sometimes you have to fail a few times and you have to make some mistakes and learn from them and not repeat them especially in a game
3935255 its been really fun to see them ive been amazed at how well theyve caught on i think coach saban and the staff did a really good job of making them feel comfortable here and during the summer with the workouts and conditioning and weights that we do it makes it really easy for them to come out the first day of practice and feel like they are comfortable with where they are at and where they are going they are not so head up in the sky and not knowing what field to run to and where to be because we work a lot of those drills in the summer on our own as players they do a really good job of making them feel comfortable and i think that helps a lot
3935256 there has been many times where a receiver was blocking downfield which is big its effort they love to catch the ball and they are open but you dont really understand how valuable a receiver that can block downfield and likes to be physical how valuable that is to the team they have done a really good job of finishing plays i think the overall size when they came in they look a lot different than lot of the classes ive seen come in in the past they look like they have been in the weight room they look like they work hard and they do that is nice to see i think they are going to have a really good career here
3935257 if you play long enough things like that are going to happen there is nothing i can really do about it the thing about it is im not real gun shy so thats not going to hinder me any

3935263 this is the music i heard as a kid in my fathers store and its where all the richness and strength of brazilian popular music comes from
3935264 as sons of the portuguese caetano and gil and all the rest of us tropicalistas absorbed this folk influence transmuted it and then took it to the world
3935265 i hear it most clearly and beautifully when caetano sings he has developed a sophisticated inventive way to use these modulations that were quite common in the singers we heard there in the backlands of the northeast
3935266 it gives me chills just to think of the similarities
3935267 its like mother africa ended up with grandsons in alabama and pernambuco
3935268 by the 1930s m rio de andrade and others felt an urgency to register popular manifestations of culture before it was too late
3935269 most of the northeast had not received electrification yet so life was completely isolated and few people had traveled so he felt he had to take advantage of the moment
3935270 when i first saw the material back in the 1980s the roof was falling down water was leaking in and i thought we were going to lose it all
3935271 but i was greatly surprised when i found most of the 78s to be in good condition and when they werent we were lucky enough to find duplicates that we could copy straight to cd and then eliminate a lot of the hisses
3935272 a goodly portion of the objects they collected especially the drums came from confiscated material at police stations

3935292 these broads are millionaires lionized on tv and in articles about them reveling in their status as celebrities and stalked by grief arazzis these self obsessed women seemed genuinely unaware that 9 11 was an attack on our nation and acted as if the terrorist attacks happened only to them ive never seen people enjoying their husbands deaths so much the democrat ratpack gals endorsed john kerry for president cutting campaign commercials how do we know their husbands werent planning to divorce these harpies now that their shelf life is dwindling theyd better hurry up and appear in playboy

3935303 but when it comes to anti semitism i think were on the same page
3935304 we mentioned our concerns about anti semitism and asked him what his position was

3935312 australian business enterprise communications usage and directions 2008 end user survey
3935313 i actually came here two years ago transferring from scoil triest the special needs school in glanmire because i have autism
3935314 im delighted with my results im hoping to do a course in computers in the national learning network im good at computers and there was a lot of it in the lca so i would like to move on from that a bit and get some qualifications
3935315 every case is individual but with autism its never over my advice to other parents is never say they cant do this or they cant do that the abilities are there you have to put 100 per cent also into the child you have to be there to support him when things do go wrong
3935316 i would say to people with children with autism going to mainstream just stick with it and open up and dont close in no matter what keep your supports open and just stick it it will all turn out fine in the end if you put the effort in
3935317 open mind on the issue he is not convinced at the moment that bonus points would help
3935318 to compensate students for the greater effort widely considered to be required for success in higher level maths
3935319 we want to change the emphasis to ensure that students will have a far greater understanding of maths and far greater practical hands on experience in maths
3935320 and were hoping in those circumstances to ensure that the participation in higher level maths will go from 17 to 30 per cent we will introduce it at first year and fifth year levels so we will have a strand into the leaving cert in two years time
3935321 what we want to do is ensure that the new system of maths introduced is a system thats far more understandable far more practical and will give students going into third level a far better reasoning mechanism with regards to maths
3935322 although there are only just over 100 000 farmers in the country 30 per cent of all work related fatalities happen on farms and this is causing concern
3935323 we understand that the farm is a difficult workplace and frequently may also be the home of a farmer as well but we must keep reminding farmers and their families just how dangerous it is
3935324 so far this year three children aged four six and 14 have died in farm accidents and a high proportion of the remaining deaths have been in the over 60 age category
3935325 it is very disappointing because in other sectors including construction there has been a steady decline in recent years in the number of deaths
3935326 we are going to make a special effort also at the national ploughing association championships next month to highlight the problem
3935327 coverage is scant when references to lung cancer in the context of smoking issues are removed
3935328 the vast majority of lung cancer coverage in the print media is overshadowed and defined by tobacco related issues and does not focus on explaining sign and symptoms of lung cancer to promote early detection
3935329 this research shows that lung cancer related media coverage in ireland is seriously disproportionate to the incidence of and mortality from the disease and supports the long held theory evident in other countries that there is a lack of interest in the media in lung cancer
3935330 they have the power to increase awareness and educate people about lung cancer and become a voice for a group that has been clearly overlooked for many years

3935345 people are realising that you dont have to be a member of a gym to lose weight
3935346 in fact studies have shown that home training is more efficient in weight loss than a gym membership
3935347 we are expanding quickly to manchester and cheshire as our popularity grows
3935348 if you have a home personal trainer you get more for your money and more personal attention than you would in a gym atmosphere and no membership fees for the privilege you only pay for the time with a fitness professional and personal trainers tend to be much more motivated

3935354 for these animals to have suffered and been tortured and dismembered it is like something out of a horror movie
3935355 they were basically mutilated and spread around in the compound where the animals are
3935356 obviously the college community is disgusted and disappointed at whats happened anybody who can take advantage of defenceless animals that are being cared for by our students is quite disappointing

3935375 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
3935376 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
3935377 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
3935378 lets be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that russia and the united states have engaged in on iran or north korea
3935379 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe
3935380 this is much bigger than any other place where there is american influence and this is the most natural allies of america
3935381 there will be no compromise at the expense of our territorial integrity
3935382 i never accused the united states in the first place of anything
3935383 i just said that the russians mistook some of the statements at certain levels
3935384 i dont think you can have any doubt but that the united states has from the very beginning believed that the south ossetian situation needed to be resolved and resolved peacefully as weve been working for months and months and months to do but that russia seriously overreached that russia engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in south ossetia
3935385 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3935386 se voc n o vem depressa at aqui nem eu posso correr sua casa que seria de mim at o amanhecer
3935387 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3935388 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3935389 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3935390 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3935391 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3935392 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3935393 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3935394 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3935395 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3935396 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3935397 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3935398 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3935399 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3935400 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3935401 we welcome the fec looking into this because we are confident they will find what we have known all along that we did nothing wrong
3935402 i think its going to be a case that the fec is going to have to take seriously
3935403 if you have 10 associates in a photo lab and six sign union authorization cars now the store is unionized
3935404 the statements are not correct representations of what the law would require even under the current law
3935405 it would be a violation of the national labor relations act to say those things
3935406 if democrats get the votes they need and elect a democratic president they said it will be the first bill presented and thats scary
3935407 when i was little my dad belonged to the united auto workers union they went out on strike and he had to walk the picket line for six months
3935408 actively collecting signatures for authorization cards now at our stores
3935409 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but also a cherished friend and confidant
3935410 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie

3935423 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3935424 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3935425 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
3935426 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
3935427 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
3935428 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
3935429 but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3935430 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media

3935443 its very embarrassing when you meet like a russian prostitute and she says shes a supermodel and youre like hey me too
3935444 i talked to alfonso about it and i told him that hes one of our leaders here and theres no need for that and he agrees and says it wont happen again its over
3935445 i apologized to piniella and i apologized to my teammates
3935446 i said to him thats not going to happen again i apologized to him
3935447 its part of the game but you cant throw at someones head
3935448 i dont know what they want to do to have two guys thrown out
3935449 i dont want to fight with somebody in the game thats not me
3935450 i didnt think they would throw at me in the last at bat and they did
3935451 they do it and i take it like its part of the game we have pitchers who can do that to the other team if they do it to us why cant we do it to them
3935452 weve worked extraordinarily hard to build a culture where every single day matters and that first day that first week does set a tone for what happens the rest of the school year
3935453 i am very grateful for the attention meeks has brought to this issue
3935454 but i think we can fight this battle and win this battle without doing anything that puts students on a course of behavior that is self destructive
3935455 i was swinging a 34 and i wanted a 33 1 2 and ive been rolling with it for a while it feels comfortable in my hands
3935456 movies and media like the movie tropic thunder encourage disrespect of people with intellectual disabilities we want that to stop

3935458 obviously wed like to get him signed and get him out playing
3935459 i wouldnt call it a distraction but its disappointing because we didnt think this one was going to go like this
3935460 the last one i think everybody expected to be an 11th hour deal this one we didnt and in that regard its a disappointment
3935461 i think you have to when youve gone this far
3935462 fortunately wed be taking the fifth pick in the country and we wouldnt be getting the 35th pick its a lot more palatable now than it was a few years ago prior to the last cba

3935465 knick fans arent passionate enough about our team and will never come together and voice their opinions they dont care that much about their team
3935466 with zeke now as the coach it will ruin the knicks

3935470 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
3935471 we stand firmly against republican efforts to undermine that right to choose at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
3935472 we also recognize that such health care and education help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
3935473 access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education

3935565 history repeats itself because most people dont listen first time
3935566 the more i learn about these rules by the bush administration the more appalled i am and the more determined i am to stop them
3935567 allow health care providers to classify many forms of contraception as abortions and therefore refuse to provide contraception to women who need it
3935568 the date is set but unknown to me to travel once more master calls on me at the most unexpected moments
3935569 there is no doubt that american workers are feeling the pressure from escalating energy and food prices as well as a slumping real estate market but the majority are making retirement a priority and staying the course
3935570 we stand firmly behind the actions of our director of visitor services who acted appropriately to ensure the safety of the museums admissions staff he took measures to protect another staff member who according to witnesses on our staff and among the general public was being photographed in an inappropriate and harassing manner
3935571 good lord he must have to consume 20 000 calories a day just to maintain his body weight
3935572 at lunch phelps gobbles up a pound of enriched pasta and two large ham and cheese sandwiches slathered with mayo on white bread capping off the meal by chugging about 1 000 calories worth of energy drinks
3935573 for dinner phelps really loads up on the carbs what he needs to give him plenty of energy for his five hours a day six days a week regimen with a pound of pasta and an entire pizza he washes all that down with another 1 000 calories worth of energy drinks

3935576 the first thing id do as president is sign the freedom of choice act thats the first thing id do
3935577 grave and clear obligation to oppose them by conscientious objection
3935578 grave obligation of conscience not to cooperate formally in practices which even if permitted by civil legislation are contrary to gods law indeed from the moral standpoint it is never licit to cooperate formally in evil this cooperation can never be justified either by invoking respect for the freedom of others or by appealing to the fact that civil law permits it or requires it
3935579 5 regarding the grave sin of abortion or euthanasia when a persons formal cooperation becomes manifest understood in the case of a catholic politician as his consistently campaigning and voting for permissive abortion and euthanasia laws his pastor should meet with him instructing him about the churchs teaching informing him that he is not to present himself for holy communion until he brings to an end the objective situation of sin and warning him that he will otherwise be denied the eucharist
3935580 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
3935581 anteriormente bebo quer a tener una fiesta a lo grande pero ella se dio cuenta de que quiz s ser a un problema la actriz es cercana a shah rukh y salman y no quiere tomar parte e invitar s lo a uno adem s teniendo a ambos khans en medio de la fiesta estar a invitando a un problema as que bebo se conforma con una peque a fiesta informal otra opci n es trasladarse a goa con el chico del cumplea os por el fin de semana

3935583 yo no he planificado un regalo material para l todav a le he dado tanto de mi tiempo pienso que ese ser mi regalo m s grande para l
3935584 holy holy holy lord god almighty who was and is and is to come
3935585 you are worthy o lord to receive glory and honor and power for you created all things and by your will they exist and were created
3935586 year 0 of the campaign to reflect its own beta ness
3935587 listen you can not tell my supervisors to go f themselves or say f you
3935588 you cannot tell yell at my supervisor and swear at them
3935589 ok ok its your word against hers im just saying that if you do do that or if any other employee does that i will consider it gross insubordination and you will be fired
3935590 ok ok hold on a second first of all she cannot mess with his time and threaten to change his time at all she has no authority to do this and his start time tonight better state 11 00 pm and not 11 15
3935591 just because a worker says fuck you or thats bullshit or something is not ground for gross insubordination the national labor relations board and the nlrb court system has repeatedly stated that salty language can be used on the job and is essentially expected when things are at the heat of the moment
3935592 in the heat of the moment thats fine but if an employee says fuck you to one of my supervisors hes going to be given a warning and fired on the spot for gross insubordination
3935593 an employee says fuck you im not doing that then its gross insubordination but if the employee is just saying fuck you or whatever that is not ground for gross insubordination
3935594 ummm id beg to differ on that one and i would like to see someone try that
3935595 well that wasnt really the issue at hand and we know that she cant change his time and that we shouldnt swear at each other so you know its ok there is no disciplinary action being taken
3935596 i think youll find that this is the real deal
3935597 i was walking in the woods following the signal with my receiver trying to find the turtle and i walked into an area where some large trees had fallen down
3935598 so theres a big hole in the tree canopy so theres a lot of light getting down to the ground and theres a lot of vegetation growing there
3935599 but as im walking i could see a patch of bare soil that didnt look quite right and when i got closer i could tell it had been cleared and some plants had been planted they looked like theyd been grown somewhere else and then actually replanted in the park
3935600 i hung out with girl talk at an afterparty last week because i rock
3935601 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3935602 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
3935603 i was shocked and saddened to hear about the tragedy in arkansas were all grateful for the quick action of law enforcement and quick thinking by chairman gwatneys staff and michelle and i are keeping him and his family in our prayers
3935604 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3935605 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3935606 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3935607 we dont expect him to make a living as a calligrapher do we
3935608 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3935609 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3935610 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3935611 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3935612 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
3935613 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club
3935614 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3935615 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with everyday he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3935616 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3935617 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there its taken both frank and the club longer than we originally thought
3935618 if you are called jane then you he he he you must be tarzan
3935619 people from miles around pack the squeaky wheel tavern in flatsville on the weekends to hear farmer humphrey git sing and play his guitar the man they call humpy git never disappoints it seems which is remarkable considering that he is a self taught singer and guitar player humpys main occupation is farming manure which he often carries into town in a large burlap bag he calls his sack o poop but rumors abound of an impending recording contract for humpy should he be willing to give up his manure farming for a musical career
3935620 while i was a wafflin my breakfast done got cold
3935621 theres a sack o nuts next to moms apple pie
3935622 humpy git will be remembered for his unique vocal style which has been described as a cross between fingernails on a chalkboard and male yodeling after accidentally sitting on a bicycle with the seat removed
3935623 humpys style has influenced many country music stars and willie nelson in particular is said to have learned everything he knows directly from humpy
3935624 its feeling all right the week off really helped by not doing too much and i got back out there today and it was feeling a lot better
3935625 he may require an operation at some point hes positive he trained fully today and hes keen to carry on if thats his mindset thats fine for us

3935646 she loves you too much to do such a thing her little antoine
3935647 you are right jeanette i will know how to handle mother
3935648 these changes are designed to reduce the number of unnecessary consultations under the esa so that more time and resources can be devoted to the protection of the most vulnerable species
3935649 the proposed regulations will continue to protect species while focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur the result should be a process that is less time consuming and a more effective use of our resources
3935650 draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species
3935651 as a result it is inappropriate to consult on a remote agency action involving the contribution of emissions to global warming because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3935652 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3935653 the new rules take decision making on endangered species listings out of the hands of scientists and wildlife professionals at agencies such as the u s fish and wildlife services and instead put those decisions in the hands of agencies working on projects that may be adversely affected by a listing
3935654 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3935655 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3935656 when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated wholly beneficial or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3935657 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3935658 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3935659 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3935660 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3935661 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision

3935678 affirmative action is a shell of what it used to be 30 years ago it had more teeth now its more about equal opportunity
3935679 to me that says that state agencies arent being proactive in recruiting for a diverse workforce
3935680 thousands of qualified persons of every race in the resume bank are not notified of positions for which they are well qualified
3935681 you have to know how to fill in the key words it has artificial barriers im not a big fan of it
3935682 there arent a lot of promotions we need to take a look at how were doing things
3935683 it definitely concerns me theres no doubt that with growing cultural and ethnic groups their representation ought to be rising not decreasing minorities and disadvantaged groups are a vital part of where the workforce is headed

3935702 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3935703 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3935704 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3935705 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3935706 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3935707 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3935708 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3935709 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3935710 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3935711 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3935712 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3935713 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3935714 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3935715 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3935716 the bottom line has been to find a coach who fit into the plan we were executing
3935717 just because a player is in the nhl doesnt mean he has finished developing
3935718 whats evident by the way his teams have played is scott is very technically sound and hes patient
3935719 coaching is just coaching the other stuff is the hard part
3935720 we could not be more pleased to bring the ipig to the masses
3935721 todays consumer demands electronics that function at a high level while still being a welcomed addition to each individuals d cor the ipig satisfies both needs with superior sound quality and a unique aesthetically pleasing design

3935729 im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
3935730 i still keep wondering about his birthplace and his birth certificate im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen
3935731 according to some people who know what theyre talking about who are experts on this they say that the birth certificate that hes got on his website and has been posted to the daily kos and some other places is it looks very much like a photoshop deal and doesnt look legit
3935732 t he republican party could file a class action suit against obama demanding that he provide positive proof that he is a bona fide american citizen
3935733 t he last time i filled in for quinn and rose a guy sent me info about his belief that the so called barack obama birth certificate is actually photoshopped
3935734 responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
3935735 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
3935736 i work with digital images all the time and this one looks like its been tampered with
3935737 im still not convinced that he actually was born a natural born citizen

3935741 its not a question of people who are already overweight becoming clumsy because the majority of these children werent any heavier than their peers
3935742 it was assumed that all the neurological complications associated with obesity were consequences of obesity itself this suggests thats not the case
3935743 but i think both sides are comfortable where we are and it will get done
3935744 were going to do everything we can as an organization to get it done
3935745 i would anticipate it would go down to the deadline like last year

3935753 i was able to get the ball down nearly all of the time thats what im working on every day to keep the ball down
3935754 its my appeal that we should adopt a reconciliatory approach so that stability should return
3935755 because if there is stability we can fight terrorism if we have a strong economy we can fight terrorism and we should all put aside our differences and work to make pakistan strong
3935756 in my view someone is conspiring against our institutions either internally or externally
3935757 but i assure you that the nation will stand together like it did in 1947 and it will prove that pakistan will remain intact despite the predictions of its enemies
3935758 i just kept it in my head that my dear generals eyes would be watching over me and that encouraged me to lift this weight
3935759 i am overjoyed by the fact that i have brought great joy to our dear leader this is the biggest present for the 60th anniversary of the foundation of the republic
3935760 i wanted to bring joy to the people of the dprk but i failed to do so
3935761 we will not let down our country or our leaders
3935762 i thought of our great leader and i knew with his encouragement and trust in us we would get the victory
3935763 i looked to the skies of pyongyang and drew inspiration from him i only wish he could have been here in person i hope that our great leader kim jung il gets the news of this victory and that he is happy

3935769 we are currently in the biggest data center construction boom in history at the same time this boom is dramatically weakening the future flexibility and financial performance of information technology the number of servers in the u s has grown from 5 million in 2000 to 10 million in 2005 to a projected 15 million in 2010 more servers eat up more electricity and energy costs go up to avoid future energy shortages caused by increasing it demands 10 more power plants need to be built to the tune of 2 billion to 6 billion each and their cost is ultimately going to get passed on to it through increased utility bills
3935770 for an organization with 5 000 servers the industry rule of thumb is that up to 30 are technologically obsolete this means that up to 1 500 servers can just be unplugged with no negative impact on data center production the savings 12 million to 23 million recovered in data center facility capacity 700 000 in annual electric savings and 6 000 annual tons of reduced greenhouse gas emissions if we did this on a broad national scale do we really need to be building all the new data centers or could we defer a large portion of this investment into the future our companies and economy would be far better off if that money went into new application development instead of bricks and mortar
3935771 baseball is different from any other sport very different for instance in most sports you score points or goals in baseball you score runs in most sports the ball or object is put in play by the offensive team in baseball the defensive team puts the ball in play and only the defense is allowed to touch the ball in fact in baseball if an offensive player touches the ball intentionally hes out sometimes unintentionally hes out also in football basketball soccer volleyball and all sports played with a ball you score with the ball and in baseball the ball prevents you from scoring in most sports the team is run by a coach in baseball the team is run by a manager and only in baseball does the manager or coach wear the same clothing the players do if youd ever seen john madden in his oakland raiders uniform youd know the reason for this custom now ive mentioned football baseball amp football are the two most popular spectator sports in this country and as such it seems they ought to be able to tell us something about ourselves and our values i enjoy comparing baseball and football baseball is a nineteenth century pastoral game football is a twentieth century technological struggle baseball is played on a diamond in a park the baseball park football is played on a gridiron in a stadium sometimes called soldier field or war memorial stadium baseball begins in the spring the season of new life in football you wear a helmet in baseball you wear a cap football is concerned with downs what down is it baseball is concerned with ups whos up in football you receive a penalty in baseball you make an error in football the specialist comes in to kick in baseball the specialist comes in to relieve somebody football has hitting clipping spearing piling on personal fouls late hitting and unnecessary roughness baseball has the sacrifice football is played in any kind of weather rain snow sleet hail fog in baseball if it rains we dont go out to play baseball has the seventh inning stretch football has the two minute warning baseball has no time limit we dont know when its gonna end might have extra innings football is rigidly timed and it will end even if weve got to go to sudden death in baseball during the game in the stands theres kind of a picnic feeling emotions may run high or low but theres not too much unpleasantness in football during the game in the stands you can be sure that at least twenty seven times youre capable of taking the life of a fellow human being and finally the objectives of the two games are completely different in football the object is for the quarterback also known as the field general to be on target with his aerial assault riddling the defense by hitting his receivers with deadly accuracy in spite of the blitz even if he has to use shotgun with short bullet passes and long bombs he marches his troops into enemy territory balancing this aerial assault with a sustained ground attack that punches holes in the forward wall of the enemys defensive line in baseball the object is to go home and to be safe i hope ill be safe at home

3935791 would think a message to be transmitted and a computer based speech recognition system would decode the eeg signals
3935792 such a system would require extensive training for anyoneusing it to send and receive messages
3935793 initially communication would be based on a limited set of words or phrases that are recognized by the system it would involve more complex language and speech as the technology is developed further
3935794 the cal maritime academy is a good combination of theory and applied science so while you do spend a lot of time doing science and looking through economics books and the basic classical education that you get in any other college they also have a whole other level of hands on practical learning its sometimes very hard to gauge what youve learned from an institution when everythings in theory here after my first two years i walk away knowing not guessing that ive learned quite a bit in a very specific skill
3935795 students graduate from cal maritime with job skills as well as maturity global awareness and leadership skills our students all take part in commercial internships during their undergraduate years and these often lead to employment offers after graduation
3935796 the network opportunities are absolutely endless the internships and jobs and connections to the real world we actually get are extremely good most universities students all live on campus and because cal state fullerton is a commuter campus employers want to come to our school and want to hire students more i like that its more a one on one relationship with your professors that theyre available and not off doing research its more a teaching school than a research school and i really like that
3935797 our student body faculty and staff represent the ethnic and national diversity of southern california theres a feeling of acceptance and diversity that you wont find any place else
3935798 because its one of the top csus california state universities and its affordable for what the campus offers its also a diverse campus a lot of different kinds of people come here because its half commuter and half residential so you could meet lots of different kinds of people
3935799 we use the approach of teaching theory through application students coming to our campus will be able to not only understand their discipline but will have demonstrated the application of that knowledge
3935800 for me its because from the moment you walk onto the campus youre immediately greeted by a diverse student population and a group of professors and administrat ors who truly wish to see their students succeed around every corner you can find opportunities to get involved meet new people and open your mind to new ideas most importantly as a growing individual fresno state allows you the opportunity to be a part of something bigger than just your own college career
3935801 fresno state is a place where faculty care deeply about teaching and learning and are committed to providing an environment where students can be successful
3935802 im really impressed with state schools in general they really set up you for a job when you graduate and i think were a really good school right now im in the nutrition program and the teachers are excellent i never thought that id learn this much in college they really have set me up for knowing everything that i need to know
3935803 we seek folks whether its faculty staff or students who want to pursue their own values at a place where civic engagement community service and sustainability matter
3935804 every great idea starts with a pen paper and a vision

3935829 while we had expected that the bigots and white supremacists would focus their anger on barack obama as the african american candidate what has happened is that both candidates are equally unacceptable to white supremacists who see them as being controlled and manipulated by the jews
3935830 in the warped conspiratorial worldview of the haters mccain and obama are equally tainted by the controlling hand of jews who they allege control the government and pull the levers of power in washington

3935836 when we look at bank profitability we find that australian banks are around the top of the international range he said
3935837 on the surface this could indicate a lesser degree of competition than elsewhere
3935838 but when we look a bit deeper it seems that an important reason for the high profitability of australian banks is their unusually low bad debt experience
3935839 this has been the result of the very strong domestic economy he said
3935840 it is also worth noting that other australian industries have been very profitable over this period
3935841 history shows that it is new entrants that drive competitive behaviour mr battellino said
3935842 it is also important that this information be in a form that is easy to understand he said
3935843 our view of recent events is that they are cyclical in nature rather than a permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when market conditions settle securitisation will pick up again he said

3935860 they went up the chain of command in vietnam but by the time they came out the other end they changed
3935861 what normally happens at the end of a conflict they have a thing called the end of war list an end of war review and you go back through what alterations were made to recommendations over the time of that conflict
3935862 these particular issues werent considered as part of that end of war review
3935863 i guess the important point and what we should focus on today is very much the fact that the gallantry of these men but also of d company as a whole and all those involved is being duly recognised finally

3935870 i come across a lot of parents trying to live out their own ambitions through their children
3935871 it particularly happens in the professions dentistry medicine or law we have fathers coming along heavy handed threatening legal action if we dont let their child in but if a person has not met the terms of an offer the university is not obliged to give them a place
3935872 you cannot plan children you dont necessarily get what you want you didnt expect this its a blow at some level you feel you havent got the results you invested in but its only going to be worse if you criticise them for it
3935873 so buy them a present or take them out because they tried really hard make light of it try and buoy them up then put your energy into helping the kids get a university place
3935874 they can say sell yourself to me then offer ways for them to phrase it better for instance getting them to start by talking about their best result first will help them emphasise the positive during the conversation
3935875 one parent commented to me that essex university is a hotbed of red revolutionaries based on his experiences in the 1960s i dont think anywhere nowadays is a hotbed of red revolutionaries

3935921 in a bling culture criminality easily becomes a short cut to symbols of wealth and power that will otherwise take years of hard work to achieve
3935922 i winced as another round of banner headlines tarred every father in the black community with the same brush the questions that need to be answered for children of all races and social backgrounds are what can we do when there is no father in a young mans life
3935923 while there may be young men on estates missing fathers who left them there are also children in middle britain whose parents become strangers in a culture of long working hours
3935924 without the missing leadership emphasis management at all levels will continue to regard the commitment to equality and diversity as superficial tokenistic and unimportant

3935937 the public prosecution service and the police worked together with kaspersky lab on this case with full contentment
3935938 we dont give out numbers but were 50 per cent over the targets that we set for ourselves
3935939 it has the potential to be a bit of a watershed because the olympics is so mainstream
3935940 we expect that more and more people having used the olympics will sign up to other packages
3935941 the percentage of bigponds revenue that is content compared with access services is still relatively small it will be in the 15 per cent range
3935942 as devices become more sophisticated with the launch of the iphone and similar devices and bandwidth grows people are going online on their phone a lot more often
3935943 the two major trends driving growth have been in social networking and in mobile search
3935944 social networking is driving the bulk of our mobile traffic at the moment and its up 50pc over the quarter
3935945 youtube is now making up the bulk of our video streams
3935946 i dont think there is a lot of content that people want to pay for
3935947 weve had tremendous subscriber growth this year for all of our sports packs
3935948 theres other content thats nice to have but its not essential so people wont pay for it
3935949 people will pay for it we have a whole bunch of seinfeld episodes for sale interestingly drama doesnt seem to have worked quite so well weve tried a variety of things including nine network drama damages its hard to get deeply deeply involved for a long time with a mobile phone screen

3935955 our increased profit after tax guidance is indicative of our ability to manage our business throughout the economic cycle in particular in times of slower consumer spending which we have experienced in the third quarter and particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 chief executive mark mcinnes said
3935956 all states showed a softening in sales growth in the second half with the fourth quarter being notable for its volatility mr mcinnes said
3935957 very challenging but trading picked up in july due to a combination of school holidays and cold weather
3935958 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planning for it more than 18 months ago mr mcinnes said
3935959 as part of the planning process we ensured that each key component of our business was prepared for a soft retail environment
3935960 this means we are well placed to deliver our gross profit margins within our target range of 39 5 per cent to 40 per cent throughout fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2012 mr mcinnes said
3935961 utilised the month of july to clear out any remaining surplus winter stock mr mcinnes said
3935962 we are now in the position of our year end stock in 2008 being eight per cent lower than in fiscal 2007 which means we have a very clean inventory position entering into into fiscal 2009
3935963 as we had expected we experienced volatile retail conditions in the second half mr mcinnes said
3935964 we have a proven business model a strong cash position clean inventory levels an established cost efficiencies program and opportunities for growth
3935965 we believe our company has a bright future and that we are well positioned to continue our track record of delivering year on year growth in shareholder returns mr mcinnes said

3935974 look at a problem long enough the solution will become obvious
3935975 estamos asumiendo toda una reestructuraci n para atender con mejor calidad a esos 4 millones de ni os y a los que se van a incorporar
3935976 es poco probable que los ajustes recientes en las expectativas de inflaci n de corto plazo jueguen un papel crucial en la decisi n de pol tica del pr ximo viernes este no ser a el caso de la evoluci n favorable de las negociaciones salariales
3935977 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
3935978 necesitamos algunos recursos pero no es que est en crisis
3935979 como ustedes saben en torno a este aspecto estamos trabajando es importante destacar que la morgue de bello monte ser sometida a rehabilitaci n y en ese sentido hay una empresa que se va a dedicar a esa materia asimismo se est trabajando sobre las morgues en el mbito nacional

3935982 lamentablemente algunos medios publican unas im genes que en algunos casos yo dir a que es parte de un montaje y hay personas que se prestan para eso pero tengan la seguridad de que en la medida que vayamos obteniendo resultados lo vamos a dar a conocer no tenemos nada que esconde
3935983 este es un recurso escaso es decir son muy pocos los profesionales de la medicina que toman la decisi n de realizar el postgrado en patolog a es un postgrado que s lo se hace en tres universidades del pa s y la mayor a de los galenos que lo realizan se van al rea privada es decir hacen autopsias cl nicas y no forenses
3935984 se han tomado algunas decisiones para mejorar la calidad de vida debo decirles que el ministro elev un punto de cuenta a miraflores y s lo se espera la firma del presidente de la rep blica para que entre en vigencia el nuevo tabulador tabulador que est aprobado y est presupuestado
3935985 el presidente uribe est buscando o que me maten o que me yo me tenga que ir del pa s y del pa s no me voy a ir la responsabilidad sobre mi seguridad y sobre mi vida le corresponde al presidente
3935986 yo puedo ser una persona que no piense como piensa el presidente pero soy una persona decente ticamente respetable incapaz de hacer ese tipo de manipulaciones que ir an en contra no solamente de la verdad sino tambi n de personas que podr an tener consecuencias muy graves para sus vidas

3935990 you muslims prepare for war and raise the banner of jihad let us shed our blood let our limbs be dismembered until we regain the wise caliphate rule
3935991 i think this is an argument the coup leaders are making to justify themselves and what they did but it doesnt conform to reality
3935992 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight
3935993 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3935994 we will now need to review the full range of our relations
3935995 has been very clear for a long time ive been very concerned about russian behavior in a broad variety of areas
3935996 address the future of the alliances relationship with russia and with our g7 partners we should discuss whether it makes sense for russia to continue its participation in the g8
3935997 we also need to review russias aspiration for membership in the world trade organization
3935998 i dont think were going to re ignite the cold war here with russia i dont see this is a return to nuclear standoffs
3935999 as the russians move into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning from senator mccain and senator obama one had a kind of moral neutrality to it that comes i think from inexperience
3936000 we are currently studying the legal details of the case for extradition
3936001 this is our priority we will proceed as soon as possible
3936002 it was he who came up with the idea for sex and the single girl urged her to write it used his contacts to get it published and then came up with an even better idea as he watched her knock herself out writing personal replies to the tons of fan mail she received
3936003 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3936004 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3936005 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3936006 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
3936007 jack reads to her an hour a day as part of his home schooling
3936008 the world is whizzing around her and shes cool as a cucumber saying jack just started can i call you back

3936011 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then peace can come
3936012 the rebel military installations and civilian areas are mixed if the army advances further and confines the rebels into a smaller region then civilian vulnerability will increase
3936013 there are no restrictions and there is no shortage we send food and other essentials as per the request of the senior government official in those areas
3936014 the silence of the international community especially by neighbouring india over the displacement and suffering of tamils is disturbing
3936015 the spirit of the folks who came here at the turn of the century and settled polish town
3936016 i always like to say they come here to eat their way from one end of the fair to the next
3936017 the kielbasa on a kaiser roll with sauerkraut is out of this world

3936019 those who are responsible for the security of the games feel very frustrated because we are in an asymmetric battle with the enemy and who can understand this situation better than the israelis
3936020 we are taking into account the possibility that the group has agents who were brought secretly into beijing
3936021 of course if the chinese security forces had information about them they would have arrested them immediately assessments and scenarios were prepared that there may be attempts to attack public places in the capital such as buses hotels railway stations and the subway but it is quite clear to me that the olympic village is properly secured and very hard to infiltrate
3936022 certain actions be taken to prevent fatigue cracking on critical areas of the forward pressure bulkhead which could result in rapid decompression of the aircraft fuselage
3936023 not a safety issue my arse these aircraft may have been flying for up to five years with missing parts
3936024 it fails to take into account that qantas as is always the case received the approval of boeing and casa for this work before it was undertaken
3936025 all modifications qantas performed on the boeing 737 aircraft were to a standard specifically approved by boeing and casa
3936026 the jack screw is an important component that has been known to seize up in the past regular lubrication and checking of the jack screw is vital because corrosion poses a real risk and must be eliminated to prevent this key component from seizing up
3936027 boeing issued a directive that this component needed to be checked more rigorously and more regularly
3936028 there was a maintenance issue involving the lubrication of a jack screw on a boeing 747 400 qantas found this through a routine check of our maintenance records
3936029 the jack screw had been inspected and the aircraft will operate tomorrow
3936030 there is no connection at all with any other aircraft incident
3936031 the alaska incident involved a different aircraft type and design with different safety features

3936035 fox news not only do i watch it i live it
3936036 but within the c i a the exposure of ms plame is now considered an even greater instance of treachery ms plame a specialist in nonconventional weapons who worked overseas had nonofficial cover and was what in c i a parlance is called a noc the most difficult kind of false identity for the agency to create
3936037 in 1997 valerie plame was being courted by a man who had served as a u s diplomat in nine countries many in africa and possessed about as high a security clearance as any spy could hope for but plame was taking no chances it was only after several months of dating ambassador joseph wilson that plame supposedly a private energy analyst revealed the name of her true employer the cia
3936038 will the white house finally comment on the leak caused by valerie plame

3936054 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3936055 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3936056 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

3936059 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3936060 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3936061 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3936075 our increased profit after tax guidance is indicative of our ability to manage our business throughout the economic cycle in particular in times of slower consumer spending which we have experienced in the third quarter and particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 chief executive mark mcinnes said
3936076 all states showed a softening in sales growth in the second half with the fourth quarter being notable for its volatility mr mcinnes said
3936077 very challenging but trading picked up in july due to a combination of school holidays and cold weather
3936078 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planning for it more than 18 months ago mr mcinnes said
3936079 as part of the planning process we ensured that each key component of our business was prepared for a soft retail environment
3936080 this means we are well placed to deliver our gross profit margins within our target range of 39 5 per cent to 40 per cent throughout fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2012 mr mcinnes said
3936081 utilised the month of july to clear out any remaining surplus winter stock mr mcinnes said
3936082 we are now in the position of our year end stock in 2008 being eight per cent lower than in fiscal 2007 which means we have a very clean inventory position entering into into fiscal 2009
3936083 as we had expected we experienced volatile retail conditions in the second half mr mcinnes said
3936084 we have a proven business model a strong cash position clean inventory levels an established cost efficiencies program and opportunities for growth
3936085 we believe our company has a bright future and that we are well positioned to continue our track record of delivering year on year growth in shareholder returns mr mcinnes said

3936169 the commentator asked them if they could send someone to see the body and they said the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body is the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
3936170 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there
3936171 i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being

3936173 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late mr battellino told a parliamentary committee in sydney today
3936174 we try to be pre emptive when we start tightening and pre emptive when we start easing
3936175 we set about to bring inflation back within the central banks target band of 2 to 3 said mr battellino a member of the banks interest rate setting board

3936177 when we look at bank profitability we find that australian banks are around the top of the international range he said

3936189 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3936190 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3936191 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3936194 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3936195 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3936196 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3936197 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3936198 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3936199 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3936312 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work

3936334 they called and i didnt really quite believe it i was hoping i was still asleep and it was a dream but it was for real
3936335 im sure she wouldnt have gone into that situation if she had known nothings worth that
3936336 shes made a huge difference in the world already but i think its just a tragedy a stupid waste that she should be brought to a halt so violently and so soon she had so much that she was offering people
3936337 in the last two three years she travelled at least half a year maybe more and to many different countries her suitcase was sort of installed at the top of the stairs always being unpacked or repacked or en route
3936338 she knew what she wanted she would work hard to get it she didnt suffer fools gladly she had a mission and she took it very seriously she had a huge smile she really loved life she loved travelling she loved seeing different countries
3936339 ive spoken with staff in afghanistan she was terribly well regarded very very well regarded by the staff and by the afghan community as i understand it
3936340 she was very hard working utterly compassionate and committed to her work a real believer in humanitarian assistance
3936341 she was a smart committed talented young woman who went to a difficult part of the world where the needs are extensive to apply the skills that she had acquired over the years in her education and professional experience
3936342 she was courageous compassionate lovely brave hard working and utterly committed to what she was doing
3936343 she was very very good at her work she really was as good as it gets as a humanitarian worker and as an individual and we are heartbroken and utterly grief stricken by her loss
3936344 her energy cheerfulness generosity and critical mind will be sorely missed by her colleagues in education and the feminist community at mcgill
3936345 knowing the risks associated with working in a conflict zone these humanitarian aid workers gave selflessly to help improve the lives of the afghan people
3936346 their spirits will live on in the continued efforts of all who are assisting in the reconstruction of afghanistan

3936353 ternyata enak juga jalan jalan dihutan bambu sejuk dan begitu damai
3936354 andai aku bisa bernyanyi seperti burung tapi siapa yang mau mengajari aku bernyanyi ya
3936355 yang pasti bukan suara kicauan burung sepertinya suaranya datang dari arah hutan bambu lebih baik aku selidiki saja
3936356 wah aku beruntung sekali hari ini tanpa susah payah hidangan lezat sudah tersedia
3936357 harimau yang baik janganlah kau makan aku tubuhku yang kecil pasti tak akan mengenyangkanmu
3936358 begini caranya coba kau kemari dan renggangkan dulu batang bambu ini dari tubuhku
3936359 nah sekarang masukkan lehermu dan julurkan lidahmu pada batang bambu ini lalu tiuplah pelan pelan
3936360 jangan heran ya kalau suaranya kadang kurang merdu tapi kalau lagi tidak ngadat suaranya bagus lho
3936361 untung ada si harimau hmm bodoh sekali dia mana ada seruling ajaib
3936362 harimau yang telah terjepit diantara batang bamboo tidak menyadari bahwa ia telah ditipu si kancil
3936363 aku mau minum dulu tenggorokanku kering karena kebanyakan meniup seuling
3936364 aku pergi tidak lama nanti waktu aku kembali kau harus sudah bisa meniupnya ya jawab si kancil sambil pergi meninggalkan harimau
3936365 wah ternyata aku telah ditipu lagi oleh si kancil betapa bodohnya aku ini
3936366 grr benar benar keterlaluan kalau ketemu nanti akan ku hajar si kancil

3936369 here comes a robot called ubot 5 developed by a group of researchers at the university of massachusetts amherst to take care of the elderly people in place of a human medical care giver this robot has been designed similar to the human anatomy with the sense of vision and touch this robot can baby boomers the time for taking medicines and when to do grocery shopping ubot 5 has the ability to track the movement of the elders sense and intimate the remote medical technician if they fall down or if no movement is recognized from the old people the robot has also been designed to converse with the elders so that they would not feel lonely the ubot 5 also has the ability to recognize outsiders or parcels blocking its path in fact it can lift about 2 2 pounds and carry to another place the researchers say the ubot 5 carries a web cam a microphone and a touch sensitive lcd display so that it acts as interface for communicating with the outside world

3936386 irigarays task is to reconcile neither the form matter distinction nor the distinctions between bodies and souls rather her effort is to show that these binary oppositions are formulated through the exclusion of a field of disruptive possibilities irigarays intervention in the history of the form matter distinction underscores matter as the site at which the feminine is excluded from philosophical binaries

3936390 the reason for this was the very inadequate state of neurological and physiological at the time not any turning against neurological explanation in principle freud knew that any attempt to bring together psychoanalysis and neurology would be premature neurology itself had to evolve from a mechanical science that thought in terms of fixed functions and centers a sort of successor of phrenology through much more sophisticated clinical approaches and deeper understandings to a more dynamic analysis of neurological difficulties in terms of functional systems often distributed widely through the brain and in constant interaction with each other
3936391 solms approach then is a double one to make the most detailed neuropsychological examination of patients with brain damage and then to submit them to a model psychoanalysis and in so doing hopefully to bring the mechanisms of the brain and the inner world of the patient together

3936396 we mentioned our concerns about anti semitism and asked him what his position was

3936437 we have a fantastic squad of players and a great manager this is a very exciting time at chelsea and im happy to be part of it
3936438 hes fit hes committed and in the modern game you will see top players carrying on longer in their careers
3936439 you have to do what you love to do not get stuck in that comfort zone of a regular job life is not a dress rehearsal this is it
3936440 life is raw material we are artisans we can sculpt our existence into something beautiful or debase it into ugliness it s in our hands
3936441 i hope you get the chance to live like you were dying like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity to think about
3936442 life consists not in holding good cards but in playing those you hold well
3936443 it is not how many years we live but rather what we do with them
3936444 i went rocky mountain climbing i went 2 7 seconds on a bull named fu manchu and then i loved deeper and i spoke sweeter and i watched an eagle as it was flying and he said someday i hope you get the chance to live like you were dying
3936445 the essential conditions of everything you do must be choice love and passion
3936446 on lifes journey faith is nourishment virtuous deeds are a shelter wisdom is the light by day and right mindfulness is the protection by night if a man lives a pure life nothing can destroy him
3936447 i was finally the husband that most the time i wasnt and i became a friend a friend would like to have
3936448 the tragedy of life is not so much what men suffer but rather what they miss
3936449 what is life it is the flash of a firefly in the night it is the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime it is the little shadow which runs across the grass and loses itself in the sunset
3936450 life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent we would not dare to conceive the things which are really merely commonplaces of existence if we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the planning the cross purposes the wonderful chain of events working through generations and leading to the most outer results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable
3936451 i asked him when it sank in that this might really be the real end hows it hit you when you get that kinda news man whatd you do live like you were dying like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity to think about whatd you do with it what did you do with it
3936452 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference
3936453 because our current method produces coiled nanotubes quickly in high yield it can be readily scaled up to industrial levels after formation the coiled nanotubes can be peeled off in one piece and placed on other surfaces to form instant cushioning coatings
3936454 if you move your hand backward as you catch the egg and increase the time of contact over which the impact occurs the impact will be less forceful and the egg will not break it is the same phenomenon experienced in catching a baseball
3936455 our studies with carbon nanotubes have been ongoing for quite some time
3936456 each step along the way has led to the next breakthrough and each time weve learned more about how they grow and what their applications could be we believe that carbon nanotubes have tremendous potential for the lives of each one of us
3936457 asphalt has a lot of advantages as a solar collector
3936458 for one blacktop stays hot and could continue to generate energy after the sun goes down unlike traditional solar electric cells in addition there is already a massive acreage of installed roads and parking lots that could be retrofitted for energy generation so there is no need to find additional land for solar farms roads and lots are typically resurfaced every 10 to 12 years and the retrofit could be built into that cycle extracting heat from asphalt could cool it reducing the urban heat island effect finally unlike roof top solar arrays which some find unattractive the solar collectors in roads and parking lots would be invisible
3936459 our preliminary results provide a promising proof of concept for what could be a very important future source of renewable pollution free energy for our nation and it has been there all along right under our feet
3936460 revolutionary progress in bringing solar energy to its full potential in the energy marketplace

3936463 no way home the decline of the worlds great animal migrations
3936464 protecting the abundance of migrants is the key to protecting the ecological importance of migration
3936465 ultimately however it is only through dialogue with vested interests that recommendations to reduce threats can be implemented protecting corridors will necessitate addressing difficult issues but baseline data provide opportunities to engage in these discussions before situations become dire
3936466 if we are successful it will be because governments and individuals have learned to act proactively and cooperatively to address environmental problems and because we have created an international network of protected areas that is capable of sustaining much of the planets natural diversity
3936467 the further birds migrate north for the summer the faster they put on weight
3936468 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
3936469 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms
3936470 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
3936471 there doesnt have to be an environmental catastrophe for air pollution to cause injury
3936472 were talking about very modest increases air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
3936473 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke
3936474 of course the real solution is to reduce air pollution
3936475 the review by dr simkhovich and his fellow authors make it quite clear that air pollution is linked to cardiovascular disease
3936476 they suggest that this is another compelling reason to campaign for improved air quality while at the same time studying therapies to minimize the risk of exposures
3936477 similar but similar enough that they could probably slip this into a cable re airing of
3936478 these low cost amplifying devices can look tempting to individuals with hearing impairment because of the significant cost differences
3936479 but our research found that the low cost aids generally dont meet the fitting requirements to help a hearing impaired person and could potentially damage a persons hearing
3936480 aside from being of extremely poor quality very low cost hearing aids those under 100 have the potential to damage your hearing because they send very loud sounds into the ear the studys mid range hearing aids 100 500 were of higher quality and were not considered a safety hazard
3936481 based on the research the best advice for consumers is to talk to an audiologist because hearing aids have complex technical features they need to be fitted and customized to the individual
3936482 currently more than 32 million people have a hearing impairment yet only about 25 percent of those use hearing aids
3936483 meanwhile the aging population is growing and hearing loss becomes more common as we become older
3936484 the 115 million bond will require discussions and a deficit reduction plan
3936485 a novel that since its publication in 1932 has probably been read by only two people namely james wood and joseph roth
3936486 this year we had to cope with exceptional heavy ice coverage
3936487 we are happy and content that we were able to recover and exchange the equipment considering the extreme ice conditions
3936488 we have been documenting this water mass for years near greenland
3936489 it was almost impossible to provide evidence of it since 2004
3936490 for these purposes we had to relocate the equipment anchored at the seafloor last year further to the north to follow the receding ice and to ascertain that they stood at least temporarily in the sphere of influence of the ice edge

3936508 id like to explain how a dashingly youthful 59 year old came to be driving a geezermobile in the first place

3936510 to start it place the transmission shift lever in the
3936511 yeah i know it sounds crazy but i think we can make it work
3936512 drive ahead of my actual position because only the brakes worked immediately
3936513 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
3936514 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
3936515 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir
3936516 it would be nice if the links to the references were valid
3936517 its basically one under a vc its very significant and its long overdue
3936518 they went up the chain of command in vietnam but by the time they came out the other end they changed
3936519 what normally happens at the end of a conflict they have a thing called the end of war list an end of war review and you go back through what alterations were made to recommendations over the time of that conflict
3936520 these particular issues werent considered as part of that end of war review
3936521 i guess the important point and what we should focus on today is very much the fact that the gallantry of these men but also of d company as a whole and all those involved is being duly recognised finally
3936522 the 36 year old woman was subsequently breath tested and allegedly recorded a staggering blood alcohol reading of 0 336
3936523 the results suggest that efforts should be made to develop drugs that could be given in a controlled clinical or treatment environment in which addicts would have their most potent drug memories reactivated such treatments would be expected to diminish the effects of those memories in the future and help individuals resist relapse and maintain their abstinence
3936524 this is a new approach to the treatment of drug addiction that has great potential additionally this might also be used to treat other neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by maladaptive memories including post traumatic stress and phobic anxiety disorders
3936525 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s
3936526 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
3936527 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules
3936528 and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
3936529 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
3936530 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels
3936531 you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol
3936532 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
3936533 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
3936534 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
3936535 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
3936536 the u s food and drug administration and other health organizations around the world have concluded that msg is safe
3936537 when are the midges going to be active and what can we do to put a barrier between our livestock and these midges
3936538 the benefit of these techniques is that until very recently midge surveillance relied upon the use of light traps that sometimes do not represent what is happing on animals particularly well
3936539 all of this work contributes to the aims for better knowledge about culicoides that were set out in the european food safety authoritys scientific opinion on bluetongue published a couple of weeks ago
3936540 bluetongue is a terrible disease of ruminant livestock our farmers have worked hard to contain this virus in the infected areas of the south east and east anglia through vaccination and vigilance but we know that we couldnt have achieved this without the effort and knowledge of the scientists at iah bluetongue shares its transmission vector the midge with other exotic but equally serious diseases such as african horse sickness so any knowledge and understanding of the midges behaviour and breeding patterns are welcome we wish the experts at iah success in their endeavours with this project
3936541 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
3936542 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3936543 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
3936544 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
3936545 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
3936546 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
3936547 use of this adapter would represent a significant cost and energy savings annually and over the life of the dryer one day wed love it if conventional dryers could be sold with our idea as a simple modification kit
3936548 architects integrate technology into buildings and make that technology practicable for instance an architect can orient the house to receive solar energy
3936549 we looked at figures nationwide and we found that use of the therapy was extremely variable
3936550 basically a lot of people who should be getting the therapy arent and some of the people who are getting it may not need it
3936551 our findings parallel previous studies evaluating adoption of new medical technology in that they show racial disparity in who is receiving the newest therapies
3936552 in contrast to previous studies however we didnt find any gender gap in the use of crt
3936553 crt is an effective therapy for many patients and this study suggests clinically practice varies greatly compared to what it should be according to recommended guidelines
3936554 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3936555 conventional oceanographic platforms cannot provide observations under the sea ice particularly on the antarctic continental shelf where the most important water mass transformations take place until now our ability to represent the high latitude oceans and sea ice in oceanographic and climate models has suffered as a result
3936556 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3936557 by providing ocean measurements under the sea ice the seals are helping us to establish the global ocean observing system we need to detect and understand changes in the ocean

3936559 allison has a special gift of looking at questions from new perspectives and recognizing relationships that others have either overlooked or missed all together
3936560 this ability has enabled her to make a couple of key breakthroughs as a graduate student that have stumped other scientists for decades
3936561 one symptom of an infected tomato or potato plant with this bacterium is yellowing of the foliage
3936562 the saliva of the tomato psyllid has been known to cause yellowing of tomato and potato leaves the cause of this symptom has been a mystery for over a century
3936563 what we know is that the bacterium is vectored by the tomato potato psyllid into their tomato and potato host plants subsequently causing yellowing and death to the plant
3936564 this knowledge may help growers come up with alternative strategies for controlling this pest were now working in the lab to confirm whether candidatus liberibacter psyllaurous is the psyllid yellows causing bacterium
3936565 chinese farmers call the young infected yellowing shoots of citrus yellow dragons because of the symptoms this disease causes in the plant
3936566 liberibacter psyllaurous could be a good model system to come up with methods for combating citrus greening disease
3936567 findings from this study suggest the significant role that built environment plays in either positively or negatively impacting our health and or lifestyle
3936568 34 of u s adults aged 20 and over are obese part of the rise in this disease may be attributed to our surroundings for example increased accessibility to unhealthy foods the built environment is also creating barriers for our ability to exercise many neighborhood areas lack parks and other recreational facilities and suburbs are often designed to discourage neighborhood walking simply focusing on encouraging people to change their lifestyles to eat better and to get more exercise is insufficient measures are also needed to improve features of the built environment which are often modifiable e g via changes in city zoning development policies to support people in making such changes

3936604 we know that bacteria have nothing to do with loss of enamel witness the billions of animal and human remains in the earth which have lost all flesh and are reduced to tooth enamel and bones it is quite evident that the teeth have been through bacterial contact but are unaffected the same with human teeth they cannot be affected by bacteria because there is no carbon or hydrogen in enamel which bacteria subsist on bacteria cannot damage the enamel which is made up of calcium hydroxy phosphate there is no such thing as decay of the enamel caused by bacteria since bacteria require carbon and hydrogen to live billions of human and animal remains show teeth and bones are resistant to earth bound organisms
3936605 study of streptococcic mutans as a source of so called decay is a waste of government funding
3936606 by drinking a sip of water along with the acid during eating the acid reacts chemically with water immediately to form hydronium ion and thus the enamel is saved

3936645 chipper is a great talent and hes having one of his best years he just gets better and better
3936646 hes a hall of famer switch hitter hes smart and he knows how to hit
3936647 lets be honest hes towards the other half of his career as opposed to the beginning half and its amazing to get your average to continue at that level most guys go the other way mike schmidt is one of the few guys i remember that got better and better
3936648 murph has been a legend in atlanta for a long time and still is so i think it means an awful lot
3936649 i think chipper the last two years is swinging a bat and playing as good as ive ever seen him said cox
3936650 we decided in the eighth inning that when it came to the ninth if were leading were going with gonzo no matter what
3936651 all i remember him throwing in pittsburgh was 93 94 so that part is back and i think his breaking ball is right there too
3936652 when hes throwing the fastball and then he throws that curve ball up there if he bounces it theyre going to swing at it
3936653 hes kind of like billy wagner in that respect when hes throwing the breaking ball and the fastball hes hard to hit at
3936654 hes 22 years old and when hes on the mound youd think hes a 10 year veteran
3936655 when youre a pitcher and youve got the stuff hes got and you can put the ball where you want hes going to do what he did tonight
3936656 i wanted to get the team in the win column tonight
3936657 that last inning you could see i tried to over do it
3936658 i got in trouble and tried to over through i need to stop doing that especially if i want to go deep in the game
3936659 this is what we expect from him its alot of pressure for a young kid but we expect alot of things out of him he stepped up tonight and showed how good he can be
3936660 he was sensational i thought did a very impressive job

3936739 the thing that occurred to me before i went out during the year was play like it could be your last game
3936740 its been well documented that i had a lot of injuries and each game i addressed like it could be my last game and thatll be probably the main theme of it

3936746 weve seen this in the past before in motorolas razr line it was a very big seller but the first version of that phone had rf radio frequency problems they had to recall it fix it and put it back out there
3936747 it could end up drawing more power because now the phone thinks its getting a worse signal than it actually is when it goes to talk to the network it speaks louder than it needs to

3936749 i see no reason why the court shouldnt act in accordance with the wishes of the parties
3936750 it was a public road and the toll was put on it by the previous coalition government
3936751 we did commit in 1995 to remove the toll the contract prevented us from doing that without massive payment from the taxpayers so we introduced cashback
3936752 in 2010 the concession period ends and the toll is scheduled to come off

3936755 if its meant to be it will happen that would be fantastic for brendan but we just worry about winning
3936756 we wont be going out of our way to run into open goals and try to kick the ball at right angles when the goal should be kicked
3936757 but i think both sides are comfortable where we are and it will get done
3936758 were going to do everything we can as an organization to get it done
3936759 i would anticipate it would go down to the deadline like last year

3936772 we cannot wait to see a fall in inflation before we start cutting rates because by then it would be too late mr battellino told a parliamentary committee in sydney today
3936773 we try to be pre emptive when we start tightening and pre emptive when we start easing
3936774 we set about to bring inflation back within the central banks target band of 2 to 3 said mr battellino a member of the banks interest rate setting board
3936775 were confident were on that path thats why were in a position to respond on interest rates
3936776 when we look at bank profitability we find that australian banks are around the top of the international range he said
3936777 on the surface this could indicate a lesser degree of competition than elsewhere
3936778 but when we look a bit deeper it seems that an important reason for the high profitability of australian banks is their unusually low bad debt experience
3936779 this has been the result of the very strong domestic economy he said iga didnt miss chance metcash

3936819 i think its getting everybody on the same page and pointing them in the right direction
3936820 everyones got to come together and be that one group and take on anything that comes our way
3936821 the players dont have any excuses to begin with to be honest
3936822 when youre on that field if you hate the coach or love the coach you need to realize youre playing for your job through the years i think the mentality has been lost or has been shifted
3936823 before it was easier i followed the cobis of the world i followed the alexis of the world and if i didnt do it i knew id be gone
3936824 maybe i havent done a good enough job along with some of the older guys of helping along some of the younger guys gain that mentality but it starts in training
3936825 its on the players and it starts obviously with players like david landon myself chris klein some of the older players

3936842 i remember the crash and then there was a beautiful light and then the canadian and the scot and i were standing at the gates of heaven st peter approached us and said that we were all too young to die and that for a donation of 100 we could return to the earth
3936843 so of course i pulled out my wallet and gave him the 100 and the next thing i knew i was back here
3936844 the scot was haggling over the price and the canadian was waiting for the government to pay for his
3936845 i believe we have a realistic chance of achieving our objectives in iraq
3936846 and as for the survivors if there are any the boats are ready to deport them
3936847 the strategy that petraeus is following might succeed in confronting al qaeda in the early period but it will leave iraq an armed nation an armed society and militias
3936848 before cho got to class that day of reading plays we students were talking to each other with serious worry about whether he could be a school shooter i was even thinking of scenarios of what i would do in case he did come in with a gun
3936849 i hope that it causes us to reflect a little bit more broadly on the degree to which we do accept violence in various forms theres also another kind of violence its not necessarily physical violence
3936850 imus and the verbal violence that was directed at young women of rutgers for them to be degraded thats a form of violence it may be quiet it may not surface to the same level of the tragedy we read about today and we mourn
3936851 the violence of men and women who suddenly have the rug pulled out from under them because their job has moved to another country
3936852 foreign policy as if the children in darfur are somehow less than the children here and so we tolerate violence there

3936864 this is not about democrats republicans or independents its about those who rarely have a voice in our political process the poor the homeless and the hungry
3936865 if the residents of this community have that discussion maybe it will force the conversation to be shaped differently in the political campaign
3936866 we are not a suburban mall we dont have a parking lot people need to take their purchases and take it out to their car these are not always small things

3936869 frankly i think patrick ohannigan ought to be out there making a bazillion dollars from his writing
3936870 that raises the question about how serious can this be if you leave them still working
3936871 sabotage is a very serious charge but it doesnt appear to fit with the fact they havent been suspended even suspended with pay
3936872 a commanding officer could review the file and decide the charge should not be proceeded with
3936873 once we go through that criteria and we decide to lay charges then we select the charges
3936874 it could be the same charges that were laid initially it can be some of the charges it can be new charges or we can decide not to lay any charges
3936875 why were they allowed to continue to work even if they were under suspicion
3936876 i think the department of national defence and the minister should give canadians some assurances about this case
3936877 two canadian forces members charged with sabotage that raises many questions and yet neither the government or the department have given us any understanding of what this means
3936878 im confident that his or her identity will be maintained in this instance
3936879 the ideal situation is a collaboration between home and school and so its very important to keep the lines of communication open
3936880 we have to have so much more support from parents now because children are so much more i guess independent and not as structured as they used to be
3936881 were having fun we do activities that will get the kids involved talking with one another learning about themselves learning about their classmates so it will be an active day
3936882 set a goal what is it that you really want to accomplish and keep your eye on your goal because it does help to prevent the distractions
3936883 remember their game face of what they are you here for
3936884 there is no asbestos thats airborne so i want to make that clear
3936885 its the material thats up there theres still some asbestos in that material thats left up in the ceilings

3936887 this is a very disappointing decision it puts canada more fully in complicity with an illegal and immoral war jeremy will probably end up back here at fort bragg thats usually what happens
3936888 no mans land status meant it was free from being policed by neither wilmette or kenilworth no one could enforce law and order there making it a haven for all the illegal pleasures of the downtown speakeasy this status also lead to its downfall

3936890 i always like to say they come here to eat their way from one end of the fair to the next
3936891 the kielbasa on a kaiser roll with sauerkraut is out of this world
3936892 it is continuing hopefully not for as long as the speculation about frank
3936893 hey guys i got tagged off the break but dont worry i wiped
3936894 in todays forum citizens of the fifth district got a clear contrast of the two choices ahead of them in november more of congressman goodes same failed policies that have led to job loss higher gas prices and a less secure world or tom perriellos positive agenda and energetic vision for the future we certainly won over the room and we believe we can win over the fifth district
3936895 the issue of energy security is our number one national security threat our number one environmental threat and our number one economic opportunity we need a complete generational commitment to energy independence and we must be committed to making the 5th district this nations leader in alternative energy
3936896 goode has never voted for an energy plan that wouldnt make the gas companies more money he has 200 000 personally invested in oil and gas companies he has taken over 100 000 in contributions from big energy and big oil and every single one of his votes makes them more money
3936897 this is another area where i have not sat on the sidelines ive been working since 2006 to ask the right questions we need people who understand how to fix this war every single person in washington has failed on this issue i will stand up to any democrat or republican who continues to fail to push toward peace in iraq
3936898 i dont agree with the premise that the united states has a bad health care system i also contest 45 million uninsured people there are about 12 to 15 million persons in the country illegally and most of them dont have health insurance and we can reduce that figure significantly if they werent in the united states
3936899 anyone who thinks the healthcare system in america is working is probably on the kind of healthcare that members of congress get instead of the healthcare that the rest of us get

3936906 its not comprehensive of the entire board meeting however you cant argue that the events that are portrayed in there didnt take place
3936907 in this day and age with youtube and facebook its just a matter of time before somebody did something like this
3936908 it did give me some thought on what i should or should not say in a board meeting
3936909 i think its great because the level of trust in politicians in the united states is at an all time low
3936910 at least with a clip on youtube you are seeing what really happened no one can doctor or misconstrue what has been said
3936911 you too could become a millionaire and get your taxes cut
3936912 everyone thinks they are middle class because everyone has permission pushed by the media and reality tv to dream they too could win the lottery become an american idol a survivor an andy warhol cartoon character
3936913 never take decisions when youre stressed say help and people will dont hug it to yourself and get depressed talk to others and work out what you want to do next
3936914 if you can persuade them you are really keen it could swing the balance
3936915 most of the calls are from people saying it says here i have my place is it true dont think youre too late if you dont get through right away

3936929 there were 3 mercury spills that i am aware of and they were all immediately contained approximately 1 spoonful was spilt on the inside of the telescope structure the incidents were completely documented and the spills were completely contained there was no possible way that the mercury could have leaked out of the telescope the biggest risk was the health risk to employees working at the facility at the time of the spill going forward modern technology does not require mercury to operate the telescopes
3936930 waste water facilities on mauna kea are an aesthetic concern however septic and cesspool systems are used all over the state and have been no cause for concern
3936931 piko of the pacific it is considered the place of creation and also a place where great gods clashed mauna kea is a place of great cultural sacredness it deserves a sense of reverence for example when people see the supreme court building it isnt a place of religious worship but it is a place of cultural sacredness representing important ideals and it is treated with reverence we dont put satellite dishes on top of it there are places that should be revered and protected beyond religion
3936932 mauna kea is a culturally significant site and any development on the mountain must be done respectfully with the input of the native hawaiian community
3936933 often we hear the full spectrum of the native hawaiian community there are native hawaiians throughout uh that support building the tmt in 1881 king kalakaua wrote a letter after visiting the lick observatory in california stating that he wanted an observatory like it for hawaii up until 1995 prominent hawaiians like governor waihee were involved in groundbreakings and other events supporting astronomy now other community members would like to see the telescopes removed from mauna kea we do not intend to minimize the feelings and cultural concerns but there are many voices
3936934 very well aware that we need to find a middle ground i would like to see fewer telescopes but still have mauna kea be home to the very best in the world when the tmt project is seen in the framework of science education and humanity we find enormous value for every human that wants to understand our world and our place in the universe
3936935 when you level the summit and take away the view plane those are heavy things you cannot do those things while at the same time saying that you respect the culture
3936936 stake holders have something to gain from using a resource they want to do research and are requesting the privilege of using what belongs to the right holders right holders are to whom the resources belong the people of hawaii and the people of the world
3936937 the public trust land was originally leased to the university for 1 they are currently under the same agreement the university then subleases land to other countries and universities and they dont pay to use the land they pay the university for telescope use and viewing time the exchange is not made in dollars and so does not go to benefit the public as owners of the public trust lands
3936938 this imbalance is a legitimate concern the benefits are focused too much on the astronomy community and there should be more tangible direct benefits to the local community you will see this in future proposals the tmt proposal includes scholarships this issue needs more thorough discussion and astronomers should stay out of it the community needs to decide and be clear about the benefits they are requesting
3936939 150 million per year and 400 jobs these jobs are not just for highly trained astronomers the operation of the telescopes requires a range of support from office clerks to maintenance personnel and many positions are filled by big island locals
3936940 astronomy is one of the very few areas where uh has developed world leadership in exchange for building two 100 million telescopes uh has leased the land for a symbolic 1 to each observatory within a few years the original 88in telescope had out performed all others on earth much of the recent fundamental progress in astronomy has come from mauna kea the research institute of astronomy was created and although it is much younger than others it has quickly become one of the top 5 in the world because students have access to viewing time
3936941 science is fundamentally important to the community there is no progress without it humans are curious by nature and want to learn about he world we live in and our role in the universe
3936942 there is an inherent good in discovering more about astronomy
3936943 but is it balanced with the cost to other values
3936944 research generates money from technologies for military and civilian purposes with information gathered on mauna kea
3936945 public right holders of the summit and stake holders that have economic interests are placed on the same plane what are the limits and other values that need to be respected when we think about mauna kea
3936946 this is science for the sake of knowing there is no money generated from operating the telescopes and any technology developed is for the sake of science not money what is produced are publications for scientific journals
3936947 is as old as galileos first telescope 400 years ago
3936948 science is not bad things just need to be viewed in the proper context with accountability and questioning science needs to be balanced with other values and ways of knowing progress does not mean the same thing for everyone
3936949 publicly accountable management body lets see a real mauna kea management commission where every person isnt appointed by the developer we want a comprehensive conservation plan that truly respects all values the plan needs a numeric limit to telescope impact and way to measure impacts of the telescopes
3936950 the university wants to be the manager of the mauna kea land uh hired a private consulting firm to write a management plan to propose to dlnr private consults shouldnt drive the plan that is the role of government there is an inherent good in discovering more about astronomy but it needs to be balanced with the cost to other values they uh have clear development interests and plans
3936951 the board of land amp natural resources manages the conservation district including mauna kea and they are the publicly accountable entity dlnr should be creating this conservation management plan for mauna kea what they create will be fundamentally different from a telescope development plan
3936952 it is not the dlnrs responsibility to write the management plan

3936959 while we are encouraged by these early results we are increasing our flexibility to give us the levers to pull in tougher market conditions including fuel price hedging and capacity management in all our markets

3936966 i cant speak highly enough of them nor the fans who sent me loads of letters after what happened in my private life they have been fantastic throughout my time here and hopefully i can repay them on the pitch

3937058 kau benar terlebih lihai dari oey lao shia aku takluk padamu
3937059 aku tidak sudi duduk di perahu kecil aku menghendaki yang besar
3937060 siapa menduduki itu dia mesti celaka kalau tidak sakit tentu dapat halangah maka itu sudah lama dibiarkan saja tidak dipakai siapa bilang aku pelit jikalau kau tidak percaya sekarang aku nanti bakar untuk kau lihat
3937061 aku hendak duduk perahu baru itu aku hendak duduk perahu baru itu

3937076 bagian bawah dari kiu im cin keng itu bukankah kau yang memberikannya kepada ciu pek thong
3937077 ada sehelai barang yang aku berikan pada ciu toako aku tidak tahu barang apa itu
3937078 bukankah kau telah merampasnya itu dari bwee tiauw hong dengan tanganmu sendiri syukur oey yok su si tua bangka itu tidak mendapat tahu mestinya kau pun telah membilangnya kau telah paham kitab itu bahwa selanjutnya di kolong langit ini tidak ada tandinganmu
3937079 oey lao shia telah kena aku jual aku bergurau dia kira itulah benar benar
3937080 jadi benar tadinya ceng jie tidak ketahui halnya kitab itu
3937081 dia hanya mengira itu latihan napas saja jikalau dia mengetahuinya lebih dulu mana dia sudi belajar padaku adikku kau sekarang telah ingat baik baik isi kitab bukan bukankah kau bakal tidak akan melupakannya pula
3937082 bagaimana kau masih berguyon saja nanti aku bicara sama saudara yok
3937083 tanpa perkenan dari oey peehu siauwtit tidak berani meminjamkannya kepada lain orang
3937084 benar benar aku tolol mengapa aku hendak meminjam peta dari bocah ini dia justru menghendaki sangat supaya oey lao shia membenci muridku
3937085 perahunya saudara yok itu mungkin benar ada rahasianya maka itu baiklah kamu legakan hatimu nanti perahuku mengikutinya dari belakang jikalau ada perlunya akan aku memberikan bantuanku
3937086 aku justru hendak mencoba coba ada apakah yang aneh pada perahunya oey lao shia ini jikalau kau mengikuti kita habisnya tidak ada bahaya tidak ada bencana bukankah itu tidak ada artinya
3937087 hendak aku melihatnya apakah bisa perahu ini membikin mampus kita bertiga
3937088 mungkin kalau satu hari oey lao shia kumat tabiatnya dia juga bakal mengutungi lidah putrinya kalau itu sampai terjadi maka barulah aku percaya benar dia mempunyai kepandaian lihai
3937089 sekarang mari kita periksa ke dasar perahu ada apanya yang aneh
3937090 dia bilang perahunya ini berbahaya toh bahayanya tidak ada sungguh menyebalkan
3937091 benar benarkah ia bermaksud baik si tua bangka berancu itu tidak biasanya bertabiat demikian baik budi
3937092 mari aku ajarkan kau semacam ilmu mengemis nasi jikalau tuan rumah tetap tidak sudi mengamal kau libat dia selama tiga hari tiga malam supaya kau buktikan nanti dia suka mengamal atau tidak
3937093 jikalau kau tidak pergi anjing jahat itu bakal menggigitnya habis bagaimana
3937094 tuan rumah yang demikian tidak berperasaan prikemanusiaan kalau malamnya kau santroni dan mencuri sepuasnya hartanya itulah tidak melanggar hukum thian
3937095 mengertikah kau maksud gurumu itu berarti dia menganjurkan kau menggerembengi mertuamu itu umpama kata dia tetap tidak hendak menyerahkan putrinya dan bahkan hendak menghajar kau maka pergilah kau diwaktu malam membawa lari gadisnya itu
3937096 jikalau kau mau minta aku kembali ke tho hoa to untuk membantui kau mencuri istri itulah tidak nanti aku lakukan
3937097 aku ingin toako pergi ke kwie in chung di telaga thay ouw

3937108 apakah ayah maksudkan engko ceng kalau engko ceng duduk di dalam perahu itu kenapakah
3937109 aku dan engko ceng ada anak anak baru belasan tahun maka mustahil di belakang hari kita tidak bakal bertemun pula
3937110 loo boan tong telah memusnahkan kitab bagian atas dan bagian bawah dengan gencetan tangannya ketika itu aku mengira tidak dapat aku mewujudkan keinginanmu itu siapa tahu seperti disuruh hantu atau malaikat dia bersikeras hendak menaiki itu perahu terpajang yang indah yang aku sengaja bikin untuk pertemuan kita nanti
3937111 sering aku minta naik perahu itu ayah selalu melarang dengan keras kenapa ayah membuatnya itu untuk ia bertemu sama ibu
3937112 loo boan tong dapat membaca kitab kiu im cin keng di luar kepalanya dai hapal sekali begitu pun dengan si bocah she kwee itu yang menghapalnya tak salah sekarang aku mengirimkan jiwa mereka berdua itu sama artinya dengan membakar habis kitab tersebut maka arwah kau di langit aku percaya puas dan tenanglah kau hanya sayang si pengemis tua she ang itu tidak karu karuan turut mengantarkan nyawnya di dalam satu hari aku membinasakan tiga ahli silat kelas satu dengan begitu aku telah memenuhi janjiku kepadamu maka jikalau di belakang hari kita bertemu pula pasti kau akan membilangnya suamimu telah membuktikan perkataannya

3937124 what conceivable reason would i have for getting involved in this or taking cctv footage that would pervert the course of justice and prevent the guys that carried out this terrible attack from being prosecuted its just insane its ridiculous and these guys are clueless clowns in my eyes
3937125 police investigating an attempted murder are investigating a report that cctv footage which could be vital to the case has gone missing one person was arrested and later released pending a report to the pps
3937126 this is sickening to treat other human beings like that is simply appaling i hope action is taken to remove this sign immediately we must never see anything like this again
3937127 landlords should play a positive role in helping migrants feel welcome in the area instead of playing into the hands of racists
3937128 this despicable matter is unrepresentative of a community which is making significant progress migrants play a massively positive role in our community they bring cultural diversity to northern ireland and they contribute greatly to our economy
3937129 it is an outrageous thing to do you cannot say no foreigners you cannot say english speakers only
3937130 i am renting this property without prejudice to anyone in the whole wide world
3937131 but please be aware there are a number of criteria suitable candidates must pass before being eligible to rent this property
3937132 i am looking for tenants whom the neighbourhood like who keep their noise down and will not attract attention to themselves
3937133 any infringement on the human rights of the individual concerned is justifiable for the protection of life or the prevention and detection of crime
3937134 probably the most impactive piece of legislation there has ever been
3937135 there is a great need for public protection and we are very pleased with the measures being made available to us
3937136 under the new arrangements i am not expecting a big tsunami in terms of violent offenders and sex offenders
3937137 all the indications are they want to kill police there is no intelligence at all to suggest they want to currently kill anyone other than police if innocent ordinary people get in the way they would have no issue they dont care its just not what their tactics are the notion theyve got any moral position is non existent
3937138 they are badly disrupted by our activity over 40 arrested this year on various operations
3937139 with absolute certainty that the provos are not engaged in any terrorist activity
3937140 level of awfulness that we havent even conceived of yet
3937141 whats quite interesting is the determination of cops not to be put off what they are doing its consistent
3937142 the police federation has been very clear we werent frightened 30 years ago were not going to be frightened of these people now
3937143 we are seeing dissident republicans currently at the top end of activity in my experience here
3937144 for up to a year now ive been saying my major concern is dissident republicans
3937145 but as in the history of the past we dont know everything and as a consequence of quite determined attempts to kill police officers in four incidents show they have some capability and some capacity
3937146 all the indications are they want to kill police there is no intelligence at all to suggest they want to currently kill anyone other than police if innocent ordinary people get in the way they would have no issue they dont care its just not what their tactics are the notion theyve got any moral position is non existent
3937147 weve got a reasonable grip on them we are determined to deal with them
3937148 young disenfranchised people who are seeking something to do in life that gives them a sort of awful credibility
3937149 they want to recruit more people and they see killing cops as a way of recruiting more people
3937150 the people they are recruiting are hugely vulnerable young people who i suspect more competent groups wouldnt want to touch with a barge pole again it doesnt make them less dangerous sometimes it makes them more dangerous
3937151 they are in their death throes is how ive described it
3937152 i think there will come a point in time where people have just got so sick of them we see that but the end game is always going to be messy and this is one of those
3937153 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away so its right to assume it still exists
3937154 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
3937155 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
3937156 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence its easy to deny if someone is killed by someone who is inextricably linked to provos for someone to say it wasnt authorised its quite an easy thing to say
3937157 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
3937158 lets not forget one of the first convictions for an international terrorist offence was abbas boutrab here
3937159 i see more and more of this punk gone country thing happening nowadays even kids in hardcore bands are growing beards and wearing western shirts
3937160 i guess what sets us apart is that weve really gone overboard we play country music
3937161 a base da igualdade do respeito m tuo soberania independ ncia e integridade territorial assim como a n o interven o nos assuntos internos de cada pa s
3937162 where the hell is the dark knight game tie in
3937163 i didnt have any female friends once you and i started dating because of you
3937164 if i had a bullet id know just where to put it
3937165 condenaram nos termos mais en rgicos o atentado terrorista em tr poli que deixou numerosos mortos e feridos
3937166 levar os autores organizadores e financiadores deste ato conden vel justi a
3937167 por fim impunidade dos autores de atentados terroristas no l bano
3937168 espero que este ataque n o dificulte os progressos positivos realizados para permitir ao l bado voltar normalidade
3937169 i dont know why i create i just have to
3937170 if im going to make you chuckle im going to take your breath away
3937171 um privil gio servir como presidente desta academia uma poca muito din mica para nossa organiza o e para nossa arte e estou muito orgulhoso de fazer parte disso
3937172 this could be the trigger that helps move prospective first time buyers off the fence and back into the market but it wont last forever
3937173 7 500 home buyer tax credit gets lots of public interest
3937174 does the credit have to be paid back to the government if so what are the payback provisions yes the tax credit must be repaid home buyers will be required to repay the credit to the government without interest over 15 years or when they sell the house if there is sufficient capital gain from the sale for example a home buyer claiming a 7 500 credit would repay the credit at 500 per year the home owner does not have to begin making repayments on the credit until two years after the credit is claimed so if the tax credit is claimed on the 2008 tax return a 500 payment is not due until the 2010 tax return is filed if the home owner sold the home then the remaining credit amount would be due from the profit on the home sale if there was insufficient profit then the remaining credit payback would be forgiven
3937175 acho que os fatos dos ltimos dias mostram que h muitos lugares no mundo onde n o necessariamente antevemos esse tipo de conflito estourando preciso ter uma m o firme e experiente no comando
3937176 da secular ambi o dos russos de estabelecer o imp rio russo
3937177 mas acredito que precisamos nos posicionar da forma mais corajosa poss vel em prol desse pequeno pa s a ge rgia
3937178 baiklah begini keputusan kita sebenarnya saudara yok sudah menerima naik keponakanku tetapi karena memandang mukanya saudara cit biarlah kedua bocah itu diuji pula aku lihat cara ini tidak sampai merenggangkan kerukunan
3937179 sebentar apabila kau tidak sanggup melawan kwee sieheng itu tandanya kau sendiri yang tidak punya guna kau tidak dapat menyesalkan lain orang kita semua mesti dengan gembira meminum arak kegirangannya kwee sieheng itu jikalau kau memikir lainnya hingga timbul lain kesulitan bukan saja kedua locianpwee bakal tidak menerima kau aku sendiri pun tidak gampang gampang memberi ampun padamu
3937180 makhluk berbisa bangkotan teranglah sudah kau merasa sangat pasti untuk kemenangan pihakmu ini
3937181 kata katamu ini sengaja kau perdengarkan untuk kami mendengarnya supaya kami tidak usah mengadu kepandaian lagi dan lantas saja menyerah kalah
3937182 jikalau kau ketahui itu bagus saudara yok silahkan kau menyebutkan syarat atau cara ujianmu itu
3937183 kita ada bangsa memainkan pukulan dan tendangan maka itu saudara yok jikalau kau mengajukan syarat mestilah itu mengenai ilmu silat umpama kata kau mengajukan urusan syair dan nyanyian atau soal mantera dan melukis gambar dan lainnya maka kami berdua terang terang akan mengaku kalah saja kami akan menepuk nepuk kempolan kami dan mengangkat kaki tak usah lagi mempertontonkan keburukan kami di depan kamu
3937184 aku juga tidak nanti membiarkan kedua sieheng mengadu kepandaian si tho hoa to ini sebab itu dapat merenggangkan kerukunan kedua pihak
3937185 apakah kepala penguji hendak memperlihatkan beberapa jurus untuk setiap orang mencoba coba jurus itu
3937186 dengan cara itu sudah dipertanggungjawabkan yang aku nanti tidak berlaku berat sebelah bukankah diwaktu menggeraki tangan dapat orang membikin enteng atau berat sesuka hati saudara hong kepandaianmu dan sudara cit sudah sampai dipuncaknya kemahiran dan barusan pun sampai seribu jurus lebih kamu masih sama tangguhnya sekarang baiklah kau mencoba kwee sieheng dan saudara cit mencoba auwyang sieheng
3937187 kita harus mengadakan aturannya pertama tama auwyang sieheng lagi terluka tidak dapat ia mengempos semangatnya dan berkeras menggunkana tenaganya dari itu kita harus menguji kepandaiannya tetapi bukan tenaganya kedua kamu berempat harus bertempur di atas bambu siapa yang terlebih dulu jatuh ke tanah dialah yang kalah dan yang ketiga siapa yang melukai pihak anak muda dialah yang kalah
3937188 kamu berdua sangat lihai jikalau tidak diadakan aturan semacam ini sekali kamu turun tangan apakah kedua sieheng masih ada nyawanya saudara cit asal kau membikin lecet saja kulitnya auwyang sieheng kau teranggap kalah demikian juga dengan saudara hong
3937189 oey lao shia si sesat bangkotan benar benar sangat ajaib bin aneh bukan percuma namanya disohorkan
3937190 pikir saja siapa yang melukai musuh dia justru yang kalah aturan ini adalah aturan paling aneh sejak jaman purbakala tapi baiklah mari kita bertindak menurut aturan ini
3937191 asal aku menghitung habis satu dua dan tiga kamu semua boleh mulai bertempur auwyang sieheng dan kwee sieheng siapa saja di antara kamu yang jatuh lebih dulu dialah yang kalah
3937192 kwee ceng sebaliknya tolol dia melayani auwyang hong emngadu tenaga dan kepandaian pasti dia bakal jatuh lebih dulu
3937193 jikalau aku mesti melayani dia sampai lebih daripada limapuluh jurus ke mana perginya pamornya see tok
3937194 saudara cit muridmu yang lihai ini campur aduk sekali ilmu kepandaiannya
3937195 dia pun sampai dapat mempelajari ilmu gulat dari bangsa mongolia
3937196 bukanlah aku yang mengajarkan dia maka itu janganlah kau main gila denganku
3937197 kau jangan bersusah hati saudara hong jangan panas auwyang sieheng lebih lihai siapa tahu pertandingan kedua dan ketiga dia nanti yang menang
3937198 kalau begitu silahkan saudara yok menyebutkan acara pertandingan yang kedua itu
3937199 pertandingan yang nomor dua dan nomor tiga ini adalah pertandingan sacara bun
3937200 kenapa kau menggunai cara bun ah engko ceng sudahlah kau jangan mau bertanding pula
3937201 dalam ilmu silat kalau telah dicapai puncaknya kemahiran apa orang akan terus main keras kerasan saja acaraku yang kedua ini kau tahu adalah untuk meminta kedua sieheng mengenal sebuah lagu serulingku
3937202 anak anak muda masih lemah sekali latihannya bersemedhi menenangkan hati aku khawatir tidak dapat mereka bertahan dari lagumu saudara yok
3937203 kedua sieheng silahkan kau masing masing mematahkan secabang pohon kapan nanti kamu mendengar suara laguku lantas kamu menimpali dengan mengetok ngetok batang pohon itu siapa yang dapat menimpali paling tepat paling bagus dialah yang menang
3937204 teecu ini sangat tolol tentang ilmu tetabuhan teecu tidak vtahu satu nol puntul maka itu dalam pertandingan yang kedua ini teecu menyerah kalah saja

3937207 aku punya engko tolol ini tidak mengerti ilmu tetabuhan tidak selayaknya ayah justru menguji ia dengan lagu
3937208 bocah ini mempunyai kepandaian luar biasa tidak dapat ia dipandang enteng
3937209 kalau ia memaksa melawan ia masih dapat bertahan sekian lama hanya kalau ia tetap terserang terus hawa panas dan dingin bergantian kesudahannya ia bakal dapat sakit berat
3937210 bocah ini masih sangat muda usianya siapa tahu ilmu dalamnya begini bagus mustahilkah sengaja ia memperlihatkan sikap ketolol tololan sedang sebenarnya ia cerdas luar biasa jikalau tapat dugaanku ini anakku mesti dijodohkan dengannya baiklah aku mencoba pula
3937211 dari tiga ujian kau sudah lulus yang dua karenanya sudah boleh kau mengubah panggilan menjadi gakhu tayjin

3937270 kau datang dari tempat yang jauh dan aku belum lagi melakukan kewajibanku sebagai sahabat mana bisa enak hatiku
3937271 keponakanmu tidak punya guna ia membikin kau malu tetapi oey peehu telah menjanjikannya hendak mengajari keponakanmu semacam ilmu kepandaian
3937272 kepandaian pamanmu adalah yang terlihai di kolong langit ini tidak ada lain orang yang dapat menandanginya karena ini adalah warisan keluargamu sebenarnya tak usah kau mencari dari lain kaum hanya apa yang dinamakan co to pang bun yaitu ilmu golongan kiri atau sampingan aku si tua masih juga mempunyakannya sedikit maka jikalau sieheng tidak mencelanya yang mana saja yang aku mengerti suka aku mengajarkannya padamu
3937273 hendak aku memilih yang paling lama dipelajarinya yang paling meminta waktu tocu ini kabarnya mengerti ilmu ngo heng ki bun baiklah aku minta ilmu itu yang tak keduanya dikolong langit ini yang tentunya tak habis dipelajari dalam sehari semalam
3937274 keponakanmu mengagumi ilmu ngo heng ki bun dari peehu maka itu aku mohon kebaikan budi peehu untuk mengajari saja aku ilmu itu
3937275 ilmu ki bun itu menggenggam banyak sekali kau hendak mempelajari yang mana satu
3937276 keponakanmu melihat jalanan di tho hoa to ini sangat berliku liku pepohonannya pun lebat sekali aku menjadi sangat menganguminya maka itu aku mohon peehu sukalah memperkenankan aku tinggal di sini untuk beberapa bulan dengan begitu maka keponakanmu jadi dapat ketika untuk belajar dengan sabar
3937277 jadinya kau hendak menyelidiki rahasianya pulauku ini sebenarnya apakah maksud kamu
3937278 kau sungguh tidak tahu tingginya langit dan tebalnya bumi tho hoa to ini tercipta setelah peehumu menghabiskan hati dan darahnya pulau ini teratur begini sempurna bahwa orang luar tidak berani menyerbunya semua mengandal kepada lihainya ini dari itu mana dapat peehumu membebernya kepada kau
3937279 walaupun tho hoa to ada hanya sebuah bukit yang gundul orang di kolong langit ini belum tentu ada yang sanggup mendatanginya untuk membikin celaka pada aku oey yok su
3937280 akalmu ini akal memancing kemarahan orang kau menggunainya dengan caramu yang kurang jujur
3937281 orang bilang sesudah tiga tahun menjadi pengemis berpangkat pun dia tak sudi tetapi saudara yok jikalau aku dapat tinggal tiga tahun di dalam duniamu yang begini adem nyaman menjadi pengemis pun tak sudilah aku
3937282 jikalau benar kau sudi tinggal untuk suatu waktu denganku di sini supaya kita kakak beradik dapat minum arak dan mengobrol itulah sungguh hal yang aku memintanya pun tidak dapat
3937283 kamu kedua tuan jikalau kau sampai tidak berkelahi tak usah sampai dua bulan lamanya pastilah kau berhasil menciptakan semacam ilmu pedang yang luar biasa gaib
3937284 ini pun kata katamu yang di hati lain di mulut lain
3937285 inilah peta lengkap dari tho hoa to di pulau ini ada jalanan rahasia jalan keder menuruti jurus patkwa dan semua itu tercatat di dalam peta ini sekarang kau ambillah ini untuk kau mempelajarinya dengan seksama
3937286 kau mesti pergi ke lim an dimana kau mesti cari sebuah rumah penginapan atau kelenteng dimana kau dapat tinggal menumpang selang tiga bulan aku nanti perintah orang untuk mengambil pulang peta ini cuma diingat dalam hati aku larang kau membuat salinannya
3937287 kau tidak mengijinkan aku tinggal di pulaumu ini siapa sudi memperdulikan segala ilmu sesatmu itu bagaimana dalam tempo tiga bulan aku dapat menolongi kau menjagai kitabmu itu jikalau ada kerusakan atau kehilangan siapa yang dapat bertanggungjawab lebih baik aku tidak mengerjalannya
3937288 dia kata hendak memerintah orang datang mengambilnya nantin tentulah ia bakal mengutus gadisnya ini ini pun ada suatu ketika baik untuk berada dekat si nona
3937289 lain tahun di akhir tahun kembali tiba saatnya perundingan ilmu pedang di gunung hoa san maka itu baik baik saja kau memelihara dirimu supaya nanti kita dapat bertempur secara hebat

3937311 utopian fantasy that gun control laws will somehow make neighborhoods safer
3937312 while promising to preserve our second amendment rights the party platform demonizes semiautomatic sport utility rifles and wants them banned calls for anti gun show legislation and proposes so called common sense gun laws
3937313 boiled down all it really means is that the democrats are still the party of gun control no matter how they try to re package the rhetoric
3937314 shamelessly telling american gun owners that they embrace the rights of millions of shooters hunters and gun collectors
3937315 as democrats descend on denver to nominate a candidate who is on record in opposition to sensible concealed carry laws we encourage gun owners across the country and especially in colorado to remind the party that the supreme court in june held that gun bans are unconstitutional

3937327 when we look at bank profitability we find that australian banks are around the top of the international range he said
3937328 on the surface this could indicate a lesser degree of competition than elsewhere
3937329 but when we look a bit deeper it seems that an important reason for the high profitability of australian banks is their unusually low bad debt experience
3937330 this has been the result of the very strong domestic economy he said
3937331 it is also worth noting that other australian industries have been very profitable over this period
3937332 history shows that it is new entrants that drive competitive behaviour mr battellino said
3937333 it is also important that this information be in a form that is easy to understand he said
3937334 our view of recent events is that they are cyclical in nature rather than a permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when market conditions settle securitisation will pick up again he said
3937335 although global equity and credit markets continue to be more fragile and volatile than in recent years i remain cautiously optimistic about the prospects for asx over the medium term managing director robert elstone said
3937336 staggering pace but initial listing activity reduced sharply amid tighter credit conditions

3937341 this seems to be a movie that extols some of the conservative viewpoints that we are dealing with terrorists
3937342 but batman goes into another country and with a c130 snatches a guy out then throws him back here into gotham so theres rendition at one point the morgan freeman character says to batman wait a minute hang on youre eavesdropping on everyone in gotham and batman says yes to stop this terrorist morgan freeman says i cant be a part of it and yet morgan freeman does become a part of it and they find the joker one of the ways they find the joker is through eavesdropping i mean the parallels here of whats going on is to me stunning

3937353 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3937354 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3937355 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3937356 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3937357 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3937358 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3937359 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3937360 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3937361 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3937362 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3937363 people will respond to demagoguery if they dont believe they have sufficient knowledge and sufficient confidence in their ability to weigh arguments and assess whats behind them
3937364 the danger is that we move increasingly toward being a society where the most important decisions are ultimately made by fewer and fewer people

3937366 its a kind of learning that occurs through interaction with health care professionals
3937367 we have in this country a major crisis of people listening to people they feel comfortable with rather than listening to a variety of groups and critically thinking through their messages
3937368 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3937369 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3937370 she just has a sense of where the wall is and how to get there first

3937376 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3937377 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3937393 the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing
3937394 lastly when the whole body of the church should be sufficiently weakened and infidelity strong enough the final blow is to be dealt by the sword of open relentless persecution a reign of terror is to be spread over the whole earth and continue while a christian should be found obstinate enough to adhere to christianity

3937397 to make the perfecting of reasoning powers interesting to mankind to spread the knowledge of sentiments both humane and social to check wicked inclinations to stand up for suffering and oppressed virtue to facilitate the acquirement of knowledge and science
3937398 the great strength of our order lies in its concealment let it never appear in any place in its own name but always covered by another name and another occupation none is fitter than the three lower degrees of freemasonry the public is accustomed to it expects little from it and therefore takes little notice of it
3937399 for the order wishes to be secret and to work in silence for thus it is better secured from the oppression of the ruling powers and because this secrecy gives a greater zest to the whole
3937400 how can the weak obtain protection only by union but this is rare nothing can bring this about but hidden societies hidden schools of wisdom are the means which we will one day free men from their bonds
3937401 the art of illuminism lay in enlisting dupes as well as adepts and by encouraging the dreams of honest visionaries or the schemes of fanatics by flattering the vanity of ambitious egotists by working on unbalanced brains or by playing on such passions as greed and power to make men of totally divergent aims serve the secret purpose of the sect
3937402 these good people swell our numbers and fill our money box set yourselves to work these gentlemen must be made to nibble at the bait but let us beware of telling them our secrets this sort of people must always be made to believe that the grade they have reached is the last
3937403 one must speak sometimes in one way sometimes in another so that our real purpose should remain impenetrable to our inferiors
3937404 nothing less than to win power and riches to undermine secular or religious government and to obtain the mastery of the world
3937405 the most admirable thing of all is that great protestant and reformed theologians lutherans and calvinists who belong to our order really believe they see in it the true and genuine mind of the christian religion
3937406 behold our secret in order to destroy all christianity all religion we have pretended to have the sole true religion to deliver one day the human race from all religion
3937407 there is no way of influencing men so powerful as by means of women these should therefore be our chief study we should insinuate ourselves into their good opinion give them hints of emancipation from the tyranny of public opinion and of standing up for themselves

3937413 nathan invested it in 800 000 pounds of gold from the east india company knowing it would be needed for wellingtons peninsula campaign he made no less than four profits 1 on the sale of wellingtons paper which he bought at 50 on the dollar 2 on the sale of gold to wellington 3 on its repurchase and 4 on forwarding it to portugal this was the beginning of the great fortune

3937417 masonic lodges were initially dedicated to king solomon because he was our first most excellent grand master
3937418 name solomon is not the israelite king it is the name in form but different in its meaning it is a substitute a composite sol om on the names of the sun in latin indian and egyptian and is designed to show the unity of several god ideas in the ancient religions as well as with those of freemasonry
3937419 hiram represent s a popular syrian god against whom the champions of jehovah the jews strove ceaselessly
3937420 temple of solomon presented a symbolic image of the universe and resembled in its arrangements and furniture all the temples of the ancient nations that practiced the mysteries

3937423 the final unpublished chapters revealed the entire pattern secret societies had been working on for thousands of years to achieve the ideal commonwealth in the political world
3937424 there exists in the world today and has existed for thousands of years a body of enlightened humans united in what might be termed an order of the quest it is composed of those whose intellectual and spiritual perceptions have revealed to them that civilization has a secret destiny the outcome of this secret destiny is a world order ruled by a king with supernatural powers this king was descended of a divine race that is he belonged to the order of the illumined for those who come to a state of wisdom that belong to a family of heroes perfected human beings

3937426 was lost to the ancient world with the decay of the mysteries but its faithful initiates carried it sealed to another land the book is still in existence
3937427 not only were the founders of the united states government masons but they received aid from a secret and august body existing in europe which helped them to establish this country for a peculiar and particular purpose known only to the initiated few
3937428 americas true destiny will remain a secret as long as great masses of people have no knowledge whatsoever that enlightened humanitarians through thousands of years have in their own and succeeding generations remained united on the high purpose of eventually instituting democratic rule throughout the world
3937429 tried to cooperate with the church so as to be able to work from the inside rationalize the doctrine of jesus and empty it gradually of its mystical content freemasonry hoped to become a friendly and legal heir to christianity they considered logic and the rules of scientific thinking as being the only absolute and permanent element of the human mind
3937430 freemasonry has incorporated bits of other systems in its initiations and higher degrees such as mystery schools mithraism the egyptian priesthood the system of the pythagoreans essenes cabalists druids the orders of the knighthood rosicrucians arabic secret societies and the knights templar
3937431 for well over 150 years the destiny of this country has been determined largely by men who were members of the masonic fraternity
3937432 mentally and physically competent of good moral character and believe in the existence of a supreme being
3937433 freemasonry is not a religion even though it is a religion in character does not pretend to take the place of religion nor serve as a substitute for the religious beliefs of its members and accepts men found to be worthy regardless of religious convictions
3937434 to make good men better through its firm belief in the fatherhood of god the brotherhood of man and consists of men bound together by bonds of brotherly love and affection
3937435 overthrow of the whole religious political and social order based on christian institutions and the establishment of a state of things based on pure naturalism
3937436 all roman catholics who belong to masonic lodges risk excommunication
3937437 freemasonry rapidly expanded in europe in france a number of the masonic sects dabbled with magic and occultism in germany some were called order of the gold and rosy cross or rosicrucians in england during the 1880s the famous magical society the hermetic order of the golden dawn adopted most of the masonic grades
3937438 masonry has nothing whatever to do with the bible it is not founded upon the bible for if it were it would not be masonry it would be something else
3937439 the only personal god freemasonry accepts is humanity in toto
3937440 the religion then of masonry is pure theism on which its different members engraft their particular opinions but they are not permitted to introduce them into the lodge or to connect their truth or falsehood with the truth of masonry a christian mason is not permitted to introduce his own peculiar opinions with regard to christs mediatorial office into the lodge
3937441 when a brother reveals any of our great secrets or whenever a minister prays in the name of christ in any of our assemblies you must always hold yourself in readiness if called upon to cut his throat from ear to ear pull out his tongue by the roots and bury his body at the bottom of some lake or pond
3937442 prayer should be of a general character containing nothing offensive to any class of conscientious brethren
3937443 masonry became an early and essential part of my success
3937444 jesus christ buddha and krishna are examples of great philosophers who taught how to use mind power
3937445 guidepost is an interfaith magazine and dr peale does not want to offend those who are not christians
3937446 was is and will always be the struggle against the church and the christian religion
3937447 masonry is religion a worship in which all good men may unite that each may share the faith of all where else except in a masonic lodge could men of many religions meet each praying for all and all for one
3937448 a world wide religion masonry is the universal religion only because and so long as it embraces all religions
3937449 every masonic lodge is a temple of religion and its teachings are instruction in religion masonry like all religions all the mysteries hermeticism and alchemy conceals its secrets from all except the adepts and sages or the elect and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead to conceal the truth which it calls light from them and to draw them away from it the truth must be kept secret and the masses need a teaching proportioned to their imperfect reason
3937450 every mans conception of god must be proportioned to his mental cultivation intellectual powers and moral excellence god is as man conceives him the reflected image of man himself
3937451 the true name of satan the kabalists say is that of yahveh reversed for satan is not a black god lucifer the light bearer strange and mysterious name to give to the spirit of darkness lucifer the son of the morning is it he who bears the light doubt it not
3937452 the blue degrees are but the outer court or portico of the temple part of the symbols are displayed there to the initiate but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations it is not intended that he shall understand them but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them their true explication is reserved for the adepts the princes of masonry it is well enough for the mass of those called masons to imagine that all is contained in the blue degrees and whoso attempts to undeceive them will labor in vain
3937453 because of outstanding service to others which reflects credit upon the order
3937454 blue lodge and then must decide whether they want to enter either the scottish or york rites capitular degrees
3937455 1 pantheism for the higher degrees atheism for the lower degrees and the populace 2 communism of goods women and general concerns 3 the destruction of the church and all forms of christianity and the removal of all existing human governments to make way for a universal republic in which the utopian ideas of complete liberty from existing social moral and religious restraint absolute equality and social fraternity should reign
3937456 i propose academies under the direction of the order this will secure us the adherence of the literati science shall here be the lure
3937457 we must acquire the direction of education of church management of the professorial chair and of the pulpit
3937458 it is the jesuitry of weishaupt that causes all our divisions it is the despotism that he exercises over men perhaps less rich than himself in imagination in ruses in cunning i declare that nothing can put me on the same footing with spartacus as that on which i was a first
3937459 i abhor treachery and profligacy and i leave him to blow himself and his order into the air
3937460 if you are a traitor and a perjurer learn that all our brothers are called upon to arm themselves against you do not hope to escape or find a place of safety wherever you are shame remorse and the rage of our brothers will pursue you and torment you to the innermost recesses of your entrails
3937461 all religion all love of country and loyalty to sovereigns were to be annihilated
3937462 the great care of the illuminati after the publication of their secret writings was to persuade the whole of germany that their order no longer existed that their adepts had all renounced not only their mysteries but as members of a secret society
3937463 by this plan we shall direct all mankind in this manner and by the simplest means we shall set in motion and in flames the occupations must be allotted and contrived that we may in secret influence all political transactions i have considered everything and so prepared it that if the order should this day go to ruin i shall in a year re establish it more brilliant than ever
3937464 next to this the form of a learned of literary society is best suited to our purpose and had freemasonry not existed this cover would have been employed and it may be much more than a cover it may be a power engine in our hands by establishing reading societies and subscription libraries and taking these under our direction and supplying them through our labors we may turn the public mind which way we will a literary society is the most proper form for the introduction of our order into any state where we are yet strangers
3937465 reveal to thy new chief all thou shalt have heard learned and discovered and also to seek after and spy into things that might have otherwise escaped thy notice and to avoid all temptation to betray what thou has now heard lightning does not strike so quickly as the dagger which will reach thee wherever thou mayest be
3937466 deluded people you must understand that there exists a conspiracy in favor of despotism and against liberty of incapacity against talent of vice against virtue or ignorance against light every species of error which afflicts the earth every half baked idea every invention serves to fit the doctrines of the illuminati the aim is universal domination
3937467 the appalling thing in the french revolution is not the tumult but the design through all the fire and smoke we perceived the evidence of calculating organization the managers remain studiously concealed and masked but there is no doubt about their presence from the first
3937468 we must flatter the people by gratuitous justice promise them a great diminution in taxes and a more equal division more extension in fortunes and less humiliation these fantasies will fanaticize the people who will flatten all resistance
3937469 drank freely of the french philosophy in religion in science in politics he came from france in the moment of fermentation which he had a share in inciting

3937472 there is no god of justice to order things aright on earth if there be a god he is a malicious and revengeful being who created us for misery
3937473 so perfectly affiliated with the parisian jacobins that their origin from a common parent cannot possibly be mistaken
3937474 designed to protect the united states from the extensive french jacobin conspiracy paid agents of which were even in high places in the government
3937475 you certainly never felt the terrorism excited by genet in 1793 when ten thousand people in the streets of philadelphia day after day threatened to drag washington out of his house and effect a revolution nothing but a miracle could have saved the united states from a fatal revolution of government
3937476 practically all of the civil and ecclesiastical establishments of europe have already been shaken to their foundations by this terrible organization the french revolution itself is doubtless to be traced to its machinations the successes of the french armies are to be explained on the same ground the jacobins are nothing more nor less than the open manifestation of the hidden system of the illuminati the order has its branches established and its emissaries at work in america the affiliated jacobin societies in america have doubtless had as the object of their establishment the propagation of the principles of the illuminated mother club in france i hold it a duty my brethren which i owe to god to the cause of religion to my country and to you at this time to declare to you thus honestly and faithfully these truths my only aim is to awaken you and myself a due attention at this alarming period to our dearest interests as a faithful watchman i would give you warning of your present danger
3937477 shall our sons become the disciples of voltaire a french writer and the dragoons of murat or our daughters the concubines of the illuminati
3937478 i have observed these doctrines gradually diffusing and mixing with all the different systems of freemasonry till at last an association has been formed for the express purpose of rooting out all the religious establishments and overturning all the existing governments of europe
3937479 the ravings of a bedlamite bedlam was the name of a hospital in london for the mentally insane
3937480 i have heard much about the nefarious and dangerous plan and doctrines of the illuminati
3937481 it was not my intention to doubt that the doctrines of the illuminati and the principles of jacobinism had not spread in the united states on the contrary no one is more satisfied of this fact than i am the idea i meant to convey was that i did not believe that the lodges of freemasons in this country had as societies endeavored to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first or pernicious principles of the latter that individuals of them may have done it or that the founder or instruments employed to have found the democratic societies in the united states may have had this object and actually had a separation of the people from their government in view is too evident to be questioned
3937482 there is sufficient evidence that a number of societies of the illuminati have been established in this land of gospel light and civil liberty which were first organized from the grand society in france they are doubtless secretly striving to undermine all our ancient institutions civil and sacred these societies are closely leagued with those of the same order in europe they have all the same object in view the enemies of all order are seeking our ruin should infidelity generally prevail our independence would fall of course our republican government would be annihilated
3937483 yale has influenced the central intelligence agency more than any other university giving the cia the atmosphere of a class reunion
3937484 year by year the deadly evil of the skull and bones is growing
3937485 assure its future peace by the re establishment of a just equilibrium of the powers
3937486 the high contracting powers being convinced that the system of representative government is equally as incompatible with the monarchical principles as the maxim of the sovereignty of the people with the divine right engage mutually in the most solemn manner to use all their efforts to put an end to the system of representative governments in whatever country it may exist in europe and to prevent its being introduced where it is not yet known
3937487 to inquire how far freemasonry and french illuminism are connected
3937488 resolved on the report of the committee appointed to inquire how far freemasonry and french illuminism are connected that there is evidence of an intimate connection between the high orders of masonry and french illuminism
3937489 communism is the secret name of this tremendous adversary which the rule of the proletariat with all that implies opposes to the existing bourgeois regime communism is nonetheless the dark hero cast for an enormous if fleeting role in the modern tragedy and awaiting its cue to enter the stage
3937490 our final aim is that of voltaire and of the french revolution the complete annihilation of catholicism and ultimately all christianity
3937491 mazzini behaves too much like a conspirator of melodrama to suit the obscure role we resign ourselves to play until our triumph mazzini likes to talk about a great many things about himself above all he never ceases writing that he is overthrowing thrones and altars that he fertilizes the peoples that he is the prophet of humanitarianism
3937492 with tongue and pen with all our open and secret influences with the purse and if need be with the sword
3937493 we must allow all of the federations to continue just as they are with their systems their central authorities and diverse modes of correspondence between high grades of the same rite organized as they are at present but we must create a super rite which will remain unknown to which we will call those masons of high degree whom we shall select obviously referring to the new and reformed palladian rite with regard to our brothers in masonry these men must be pledged to the strictest secrecy through this supreme rite we will govern all freemasonry which will become the one international center the more powerful because its direction will be unknown
3937494 we shall unleash the nihilists and the atheists and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect of absolute atheism the origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil then everywhere the citizens obliged to defend themselves against the world minority of revolutionaries will exterminate those destroyers of civilization and the multitude disillusioned with christianity whose deistic spirits will from that moment be without compass anxious for an ideal but without knowing where to render its adoration will receive the pure light through the universal manifestation which will result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of christianity and atheism both conquered and exterminated at the same time
3937495 that which we must say to the crowd is we worship a god but it is the god one adores without superstition
3937496 everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers
3937497 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3937498 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

3937504 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3937505 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3937506 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3937507 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
3937508 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation
3937509 this report shows that things dont seem to be getting better
3937510 and in fact in terms of the actual numbers they seem to be getting worse
3937511 canada has one of the highest percentages of baby boomers in the world and in the next two or three years the baby boomers will hit 65
3937512 lets realise that we will get a return on our investment by investing even more in looking at reducing pollution
3937513 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3937514 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3937515 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3937516 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3937517 i pose a conundrum to you a riddle if you will
3937518 the growing redirection of olympic gold medals is because the old disparities between competitive sports levels due to historical and economic causes is being constantly overturned
3937519 this also means the traditional sporting powers face stronger and stronger challengers
3937520 perusing the medals tally people can take joy in seeing that on the grand stage of the olympic games the asian tempest blows stronger and stronger
3937521 the manipulation of public opinion by media savvy extremists and the poisoning of public discourse happen because individuals and groups that express themselves freely do not aim at truth
3937522 most of the news rooms have gone from media bias to engaging in media corruption
3937523 with the proliferation of technological advances and subsequent increased ambitions on the global socio political economic platform so too have the ambitions in newsrooms across the nation increased
3937524 with full access and control of the news outlets that reach the masses and no one to answer to media have ceased to be reliable tools for information but powerful tools for fraud and manipulation
3937525 when journalism is inaccurate when it marginalizes important issues or denies access to different voices and when it is manipulated to serve narrow interests it damages democracy
3937526 protect and nourish the values and public good that flow from committed ethical journalism
3937527 to circulate the worries fears and inquiries of people who have no institutional voice
3937528 one inconvenient truth that cries out for concerted action is the fact that too many journalists are being killed in the line of duty often in areas that are free of armed conflict
3937529 to educate enlighten and to unite perceptions to take collective and concerted action for good causes and for good fights
3937530 hasta el cura desde el cielo se deleit con la torer a de carlos escolar
3937531 con los pies en la tierra y la cabeza en el cielo
3937532 qu es la vida un frenes qu es la vida una ilusi n una sombra una ficci n y el mayor bien es peque o qur toda la vida es sue o y los sue os sue os son
3937533 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3937534 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3937535 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3937536 que el tiempo pone a cada uno en su sitio
3937537 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3937538 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3937539 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3937540 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3937541 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3937542 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3937543 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3937544 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3937545 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3937546 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3937547 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3937548 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3937549 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3937550 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3937551 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3937552 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3937553 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3937554 the 36 year old woman was subsequently breath tested and allegedly recorded a staggering blood alcohol reading of 0 336
3937555 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3937556 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3937557 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3937558 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3937559 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3937560 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3937561 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3937562 when we look at bank profitability we find that australian banks are around the top of the international range he said
3937563 on the surface this could indicate a lesser degree of competition than elsewhere
3937564 but when we look a bit deeper it seems that an important reason for the high profitability of australian banks is their unusually low bad debt experience
3937565 this has been the result of the very strong domestic economy he said
3937566 it is also worth noting that other australian industries have been very profitable over this period
3937567 history shows that it is new entrants that drive competitive behaviour mr battellino said
3937568 it is also important that this information be in a form that is easy to understand he said
3937569 our view of recent events is that they are cyclical in nature rather than a permanent change to the structure of the market in the sense that when market conditions settle securitisation will pick up again he said
3937570 as such it would be premature at this stage to embark on proposals such as the setting up of new government bodies to support certain forms of financial activity
3937571 when we look at bank profitability we find that australian banks are around the top of the international range amp squo amp squo he said
3937572 on the surface this could indicate a lesser degree of competition than elsewhere
3937573 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3937574 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3937575 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3937576 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3937577 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3937578 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3937579 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3937580 one of our all time best selling directors the bulk of the pacific sun library is built on the rock hard muscles of csabas incredibly hot hungarian bodybuilders with handsome faces perfectly sculpted bodies and jaw dropping endowments his models never fail to get pulses racing
3937581 gianna has been one of my favorites since the first time i saw her
3937582 her scene in this movie is one of the longer ones and its nice to see that shes grown out a nice thick bush for this scene and as a boob movie should probably have all the cumshots land on the girls chests
3937583 i think maybe its been out there before but its not been just that
3937584 so i just focused on that and that only and well see how it goes if theres more need ill make number two
3937585 por qu google maps no muestra ninguna ciudad o carretera en georgia o en sus vecinos armenia y azerbaiy n nunca lanzamos cobertura de estos pa ses porque no est bamos satisfechos con los datos disponibles
3937586 algunos de nuestros clientes han preguntado si eliminamos informaci n de algunos de esos pa ses en respuesta a las recientes hostilidades en la regi n y puedo asegurar que no es el caso los datos de esos pa ses nunca estuvieron en google maps
3937587 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3937588 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3937589 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3937590 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3937591 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3937592 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3937593 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3937594 its basically one under a vc its very significant and its long overdue
3937595 they went up the chain of command in vietnam but by the time they came out the other end they changed
3937596 what normally happens at the end of a conflict they have a thing called the end of war list an end of war review and you go back through what alterations were made to recommendations over the time of that conflict
3937597 these particular issues werent considered as part of that end of war review
3937598 i guess the important point and what we should focus on today is very much the fact that the gallantry of these men but also of d company as a whole and all those involved is being duly recognised finally
3937599 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3937600 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3937601 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3937602 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3937603 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3937604 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3937605 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3937606 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3937607 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3937608 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3937609 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3937610 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3937611 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3937612 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3937613 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3937614 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3937615 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3937616 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3937617 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3937618 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3937619 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3937620 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
3937621 during the past year many of the top social networking sites have demonstrated rapid growth in their global user bases
3937622 facebooks recent ascension to become the top global social networking site has been spurred by its substantial growth across worldwide regions
3937623 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3937624 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3937625 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3937626 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3937627 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3937628 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3937629 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3937630 who are open to doing something on the production side
3937631 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3937632 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3937633 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3937634 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3937635 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3937640 if anyone feels offended by it we totally apologize for it
3937641 all of the spanish people are close to the chinese people mentally
3937642 to me it was a little clownish for our part to be doing that the sponsor insisted and insisted they pushed because theyre the people that pay the money it was just a bad idea to do that it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
3937643 seur approved the campaign and also it was approved by the federation it passed several filters before its publication in marca
3937644 it was born as a self assured wink to support the selection and at no moment was considered offensive or racist seur wants to express publicly their respect to all the groups and wanted at no moment to be offensive to anybody
3937645 i think some people want to mix that with things that have happened in spain before spain is one of the most multicultural countries in the world

3937651 i just cant believe they cant make an exception to the rule when its so obviously an integral of our business im livid
3937652 there are pubs like this all across the uk and they can have fires because its for the character
3937653 this is a character pub and it should have an exemption
3937654 i dont think a heat pump would look great on our wall
3937655 i want the council to have a think about it and see if they can send someone down here to have a talk about it
3937656 to have one fireplace lit in the whole of nelson i dont think thats a big ask do you
3937657 they will take away the big steel cage we sometimes have to drive around in
3937658 theres a lot of new opportunities in the food area and in sustainability you can see some of those start to come through in terms of the news theres a lot of pressure on finding new ways to produce food and for refining food
3937659 this merger would all be part of saying how can we do the best possible innovation that we can to assist the industries
3937660 we really do want to know what our staff think
3937661 when you think of the profile that would be created from bringing together plant based research with seafood research with animal forage research these are all very key areas for the growth of our economy so for science it should lead to further investment

3937665 the application of basic risk management principles to all risks facing an organization
3937666 together with our partners we provide customers with pre populated content which looks at what are the top risks by industry that companies need to look at and what risk indicators and recommended thresholds they need to be aware of
3937667 these results showed us that enterprise risk management has become a huge challenge for those charged with managing a companys financial health with many looking for guidance on the next steps they should take
3937668 very manual often confined to just the finance organization and isnt part of the core business
3937669 like millions of filipinos we want to watch the reunion concert but when we look for ways to get the tickets we are redirected to www marlboro ph this is clearly tantamount to advertising
3937670 philip morris sought to gloss over any likely illegality which may arise from its sponsorship of the event by calling the reunion a promotional event not open to the general public but restricted to trade partners and adult smokers who have to obtain an invitation by registering in marlboros website
3937671 mere play of words a marketing ploy that circumvents the law
3937672 cigarette and tobacco companies from sponsoring any sport concert cultural or art event as well as individual and team athletes artists or performers where such sponsorship shall require or involve the advertisement or promotion of any cigarette or tobacco company tobacco product or tobacco use
3937673 advertisement is likewise prevalent in the manner by which philip morris has aggressively used viral marketing to induce eraserheads fans to register on its marlboro website to obtain invitations to the event
3937674 any visual and or audible message disseminated to the public about or on a particular product that promote and give publicity by words design images or any other means through electronic form of mass media
3937675 the manner by which pmi has utilized the electronic media to stir interest and create hype about this event lure both smokers and non smokers alike to its website with the expectation of obtaining an invitation thereby creating much publicity and getting electronic media mileage about marlboro its product name is nothing but plain and simple out and out advertisement
3937676 the business of conceptualizing presenting making available and communicating to the public through any form of mass media any fact data or information about the attributes features quality or availability of consumer products services or credit
3937677 the act alone of making the concert accessible and free only to smokers philip morris is actually promoting smoking
3937678 the concert is like a carrot at the end of the stick the price for smoking
3937679 you have to create national consciousness among the majority of the people

3937683 but i think both sides are comfortable where we are and it will get done
3937684 were going to do everything we can as an organization to get it done
3937685 i would anticipate it would go down to the deadline like last year
3937686 hes starting to get there as far as getting down in the zone

3937700 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store

3937702 this is a perfect time to grow as aggressively as we are
3937703 every cloud has a silver lining in the case of a company like the bargain shop we are an extreme value retailer
3937704 in difficult economic times in particular with the increase in energy costs its something that coincides very well with our strong suit which is offering good quality merchandise close to peoples homes people want to save on gas
3937705 the whole category of giant tiger bargain shop dollar stores has been doing well and is likely to do better as the economy weakens

3937751 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3937752 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3937753 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
3937754 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
3937755 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
3937756 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
3937757 but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3937758 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media
3937759 he said its not that its not that i obviously was joking on that i said look im not here to take chads spot or replace him or whatever it is what it is
3937760 i said this the other day i dont think ive ever beaten chad
3937761 the omni fort worth has now changed our skyline forever
3937762 its obvious as we look at the results that while their bills were higher they were more satisfied
3937763 at the end of the day we all compete on a number of dimensions and customers vote with their feet

3937770 it seemed like he had an easy time with us and nobody should have an easy time with us
3937771 there are just so many hitters that can go up there and hit the ball out of the ballpark
3937772 theres a lot of professionals in here everybodys still up i think were going to be fine
3937773 theyre a great team these are the guys that we grew up watching i grew up watching derek jeter in the world series and alex rodriguez in the kingdome
3937774 you certainly kind of take a step back coming into the series and say all right this is another game but it is a little more special
3937775 chance to win a series after an emotional win last night and you dont do it its not good
3937776 we stood up well because we were so young in the middle of the park
3937777 of course for a game of that level you could be worried but i have confidence in them and i must say i have been paid back very well
3937778 we expected a difficult game and we were not disappointed they man marked us all over the pitch and we needed to be patient and not make any mistakes at the back
3937779 we changed a bit tactically at half time but most important they dropped their level a bit to do what they did in the first half to tackle for every ball is of course very difficult and from then on we looked a bit more comfortable
3937780 its a massive mountain to climb its bigger than everest but we take heart from the performance
3937781 i said before that this game isnt just about now but also the future i like what i see of this team we showed we are a good team who can compete with the likes of arsenal
3937782 we go away thinking 2 0 is an unbelievable result because of the performance we put in
3937783 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half

3937785 i had a client out here who was pulled over and the police found a whole bunch of stuff in the car that they believed did not look right then got a search warrant and went through his house when he was released he informed me a number of guns and ammo were missing police denied taking the guns but one of the officers in the search was latter fired for dishonesty of course this was after the statute of limitations had run and my client had no recourse

3937790 this was a preposterous lawsuit and we are pleased that it has been dropped americans should be aware that such lawsuits may seem far fetched but they really are happening and foreign legal decisions are increasingly cited in american courts

3937792 according to italian law the demand to remove a name from the register must be made by an individual with a personal interest rather than by a private association such as the uaar
3937793 also it was easy to demonstrate that the group had no legal leg on which to stand
3937794 exercising your first amendment rights is not a crime we believe the court made the right call here both for our client and for every american who treasures free speech
3937795 the constitution allows citizens to engage in the expression of free ideas without being subjected to arbitrary restrictions imposed by local governments that is the principle that was at stake
3937796 the courts confirmation that the ordinance is unconstitutional means that granite city citizens and by extension citizens throughout the 7th circuit can once again express their beliefs without fear of reprisal by local authorities
3937797 we are very pleased at the school districts decision we hope district officials will officially modify their policy so that we do not need to continue this lawsuit
3937798 that extend the communitys cultural recreational artistic or educational opportunities
3937799 we appreciate the school districts decision to do the right thing
3937800 we look forward to a change in district policy that will make that good decision permanent so that the free speech rights of community members and groups will continue to be protected

3937817 no girls are creeped out when you do that first you have to get her to want to see your caterpie so she can help it evolve
3937818 so are you saying i should ask misty out on a date
3937819 if you want her to make your caterpie evolve thats the only way ash
3937820 it was nothing i i just had to go to bathroom really bad

3937950 it happened and it was my fault said defensive tackle lamarr houston who said he blew an assignment that allowed mccoy to dart through the line and take one to the house

3937953 i have deer that ill never see on those cameras
3937954 im pretty convinced of this there are deer that you get one picture of every year and some you never see so does the camera tell me anything not really
3937955 the exception to the stealth would be during the rut
3937956 but then who knows where a bucks going to be all of my cameras are on protein which means the deer come at night most of the time and thats not going to help me hunt them it does help me know if theres a 3 year old 7 pointer out there but i dont think its cheating

3937980 people come in the mornings to get a medal update and a schedule of whats on in the afternoon we see a lot more people watching videos
3937981 i think were going to smash any streaming targets we might have set
3937982 when seven throws to the website we see an immediate spike in traffic
3937983 thirty per cent of tv viewers are online at the same time
3937984 its certainly being demonstrated that that audience is using the web to give them extra information
3937985 its almost not worth putting standard definition televisions on the floor even at 89 people are just not interested
3937986 in all of our stores hdtv sales are up between 10 and 40 per cent and probably by at least 40 per cent in the last few weeks
3937987 it is the only product i can think of at the moment that is selling like hotcakes
3937988 we have sold more than three times what i would have expected and again i think the olympics have been a factor
3937989 i didnt think tivo would be a big seller sometimes you just never know
3937990 we dont give out numbers but were 50 per cent over the targets that we set for ourselves
3937991 it has the potential to be a bit of a watershed because the olympics is so mainstream
3937992 we expect that more and more people having used the olympics will sign up to other packages
3937993 the percentage of bigponds revenue that is content compared with access services is still relatively small it will be in the 15 per cent range
3937994 as devices become more sophisticated with the launch of the iphone and similar devices and bandwidth grows people are going online on their phone a lot more often
3937995 the two major trends driving growth have been in social networking and in mobile search
3937996 social networking is driving the bulk of our mobile traffic at the moment and its up 50pc over the quarter
3937997 youtube is now making up the bulk of our video streams
3937998 i dont think there is a lot of content that people want to pay for
3937999 weve had tremendous subscriber growth this year for all of our sports packs
3938000 theres other content thats nice to have but its not essential so people wont pay for it
3938001 people will pay for it we have a whole bunch of seinfeld episodes for sale interestingly drama doesnt seem to have worked quite so well weve tried a variety of things including nine network drama damages its hard to get deeply deeply involved for a long time with a mobile phone screen

3938003 i think this a la carte method of squeezing travelers is basically bait and switch
3938004 they bait us with a base fare and then start packing on the fees
3938005 making the hop to hoboken twice what we were told
3938006 the airlines have been very clear in publicly communicating their rates and charges
3938007 in addition the introduction of service fees has been the subject of many media stories which has increased even more customer awareness
3938008 have the authority to determine what an airline can charge for its services
3938009 airlines and ticket agents are unbundling specific fees from their advertised airfares and we will continue to monitor the industry to ensure these fees are clearly advertised and disclosed to passengers
3938010 on average it costs us airways 700 per round trip to carry a passenger
3938011 if i now said my day rate just paid for my infrastructure and my client had to pay extra for my advice that would be ludicrous
3938012 give me the price of the ticket let me make an informed decision and dont anger me by nickel and diming me on every bloody charge

3938044 it kills me even to admit it but before i had joey i would use that word occasionally and now looking back i regret it more than anything else in my whole life
3938045 knowing that i once said that word in that way
3938046 in the context of the film i really feel like its really clear that were making fun of actors and actors who try to use serious subjects to try to win awards
3938047 i think i always feel sad all the time and including when someone actually tries to be really hurtful about it
3938048 to know that there are children and adults in your community that are just like you just like your children and its just the point of just meet them just meet my son

3938071 they do their own singing and their own dancing in the film
3938072 you get the opportunity to see both of these guys go for it in a real way thats fun and energetic mac definitely can carry a tune he does a great falsetto in the movie and a baritone and alto as well he has a range he plays a range of emotions in the film as well as octaves
3938073 when i came on they asked do you want him in the movie and i was like of course not to include him in the movie would have been sacrilege i had to have isaac in the film
3938074 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man
3938075 he is a dreamboat if i were that age and single id be in so much trouble
3938076 i said youd be exactly my type he liked it he was like that would be great i was of course teasing but of course not teasing
3938077 hes so nice and grounded and sweet as can be hes the real deal hes a teen idol
3938078 she was great shes a very normal 15 year old girl and i guess that makes her extraordinary considering the circumstances
3938079 she works hard and shes got a good attitude i think with the right direction and the right choices she can do some great things
3938080 hes a very nice guy and we had a real good time together
3938081 shes such a different character than jan shes earthy with no ulterior motives
3938082 you know shell either be a great mother or be the greatest example of what not to be as a mother
3938083 itll be interesting to see michael and jan now they always have a power struggle he had it all last season and now shes got it back again and it keeps them an interesting couple
3938084 im pretty sure riddler gets his shot ed nigma gets his moment
3938085 its a very very awesome prison i majored in architecture in college and design is how i actually started in for super max designing that prison it had to be the kind of thing that was a character in and of itself
3938086 were in a world where instead of just trying to contain a guy whos really big youre trying to contain a guy who can in the case of icicle who can freeze things what kind of a cell would a guy like that need in order to have his powers neutralized so to escape from super max they have got to go through the most elaborate heist weve ever seen involving superpowers because the prison itself kind of has superpowers
3938087 what we wanted to do and i think well continue to do as the studio continues to push the movie forward is to be able to put queen in the center of a much bigger universe
3938088 in the same way that marvel is starting to do when youre in the filmed dc universe where this world and this world and this world they all exist in an interrelated web its the kind of thing that i think absolutely is about spelling out a couple different roads for a couple different characters
3938089 by the time a movie like this comes out we will all understand origin stories and mainstream audiences now are willing to suspend their disbelief to the point that we can believe that a world exists where superpowers exist and people dress up in costumes so now what now what do we do and i call this superhero 2 0
3938090 we do deal with his origin hes got a very interesting origin with a desert island and everything else but we get to the core of green arrow not by showing where he starts but by pushing him into a key moment in his life where everything he has is lost and hes got to earn it all back i think for audiences its going to be a great way to get to know a new character

3938096 how many lives were lost during your tragic vote or die campaign in 2004 when will your savage thirst for blood be slaked
3938097 what have i ever done what have you ever done aside from you know launching a multimillion dollar media empire lording over a hugely successful clothing line shaping the career of perhaps the greatest mc of all time scoring a series of hits as both a producer and a solo artist and running in the new york city marathon on a whim actually wait never mind

3938100 did you know that the average american is blessed with a blissfully short memory and yet a seemingly endless appetite for nostalgia so much so that he or she is willing to forgive most transgressions and forego all pretenses of taste in exchange for a song that will sound excellent in very large speakers or at the beach are you aware that most of us are doddering sods brainless infants who prefer things big and loud and shiny and equate aesthetic excess with true happiness do you realize theres a sucker born every minute did i just let the cat out of the bag
3938101 thank you for not beating me with a champagne bottle or a telephone receiver
3938102 when i was growing up i had a pretty difficult time
3938103 i just found when i was introducing myself to people it was a little awkward
3938104 you get all those wee wee jokes and that sort of thing
3938105 he e mailed me right away and said holy sh the nintendo is named after you
3938106 the reason my parents chose that is because they didnt really have a name picked out when my mom was pregnant
3938107 i thought it was weird nintendo would go with that
3938108 now when i meet people i say my name is wii
3938109 oh wii are you going to go home to play with yourself
3938110 the hayes family is comfortable with dr kraus recommendation to not conduct an autopsy
3938111 we are overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and love from isaacs dear friends colleagues and fans from every corner of the world and we thank each and every one of them for their kind thoughts and prayers
3938112 i started remembering my dad did this movie called putney swope i was in new york at that time and the character was supposed to be a vietnam soldier so i was remembering some of the folks who were hanging out in the west village back then
3938113 without it being too specific i just started this gravelly cool very world weary voice and i said oh my god im going to have a ball with this
3938114 i laid the voice on stiller and he laughed and i thought you know hes just laughing to make me feel ok and then hes going to change it all when we get there
3938115 he was really improvising a lot of the time and there was a little bit of a question like is that intelligible
3938116 we did some looping too but it really was who the character was and what he was playing the idea of this australian guy playing this black guy and his interpretation of that that was always what we were satirizing the idea of to try to be taken seriously
3938117 i think this is going to be a big coming out party for him as a comedian
3938118 you knew he was a great actor with chaplin but all of the films hes made were great dramatic films this is the first one where its been full blown comedy and his skills are sharp
3938119 life is too goddamn serious things are scary i got to laugh my ass off in this movie ill take that over rocket science any day and ill certainly take that over self important dramatist
3938120 el racing no est en liquidaci n y la venta de duscher ha sido muy ventajosa
3938121 but im already starting to get the ideas and the aesthetics and everything and its very different from 2006s the black parade
3938122 its hard to say at this point but musically how black parade tapped into the glam classic rock of queen and ziggy stardust this taps into something different not punk but maybe in its proto sense the aesthetic it is extremely different and it is more stripped down too when we get a chance were going to get together and do some demos and start rolling but were going to take it slow i feel like we needed to be away for a while people need to kind of miss us because there was a point in the last two and a half years where you could have seen us at least once a month if you wanted
3938123 its weird sometimes you give interviews and they catch you in a weird mood on the road and youre like nah i didnt say it was going to be a more punk rock record i just thought it would be more stripped of the bells and whistles
3938124 we provided intake documentation and the judge said it was insufficient
3938125 the judge said he should have informed the court sooner and because it was the second time hed missed court in this case she issued the warrant
3938126 working towards getting him some help and we hope that will be taken seriously by all parties in this case
3938127 he qualified for us and he feels comfortable with me
3938128 we have to work out an arrangement that will work with the courts
3938129 we are in court again next week on other matters and my hope is we can get the warrant resolved by then and get back on track we have some things in the works to get the warrant taken care of my hope is that we can resolve it without an arrest but hes been arrested at the airport before so they obviously have an eye out for him so im not sure
3938130 its actually been really fun weve been listening to our ipods and i slept for a lot of the time weve been just keeping each other busy
3938131 it seems like time goes by so slow because im so excited
3938132 i really like spending time with my kids theyre really good girls and the jonas brothers are just awesome theyre darlings
3938133 its kind of cool to be a part of it its good to see people so excited about a band
3938134 i want you to sing this with me as loud as you can
3938135 im proud to be speaking at pax 08 even if youre not a parent come to hear me say thank you come to hear me talk about whats good about gaming see me preview concepts from my new book come join the gamerparent revolution and come see why tycho was right
3938136 probably the best ball striking day as far as 18 consecutive holes that ive ever had
3938137 it seemed i had 15 feet for birdie on every hole and i took advantage of most
3938138 one bogey seven birdies you cant ask for much more than that
3938139 ive hit a lot of fairways and greens and had a few putts roll in no headaches i havent had to work real hard
3938140 i swing as hard as i can and hope it goes in the right direction
3938141 ive played in tournaments with fields just as good i shouldnt look at it any different just because pros are in it
3938142 i come into every tournament expecting to win so obviously i came in here looking for the
3938143 she really just wanted to help the children of afghanistan
3938144 she was such a positive person she was one of these people who would always bring a solution to any problem she was a very brave very committed person
3938145 i always worry when she goes to afghanistan every time she goes but i try and convince myself that its more dangerous driving to the airport here than there but i guess on this occasion it wasnt

3938148 it seems extraordinary to imagine that four u s agents whod gone to pick her up two military two fbi along with at least two afghan translators were somehow surprised by this woman who overpowered them grabbed a gun flipped the safety fired off a couple of shots and then could only be subdued by shots to the torso

3938165 were so excited were going to go to virgin megastore across the street and wait in line a little bit longer
3938166 we do anything for our fans and we owe everything we have to them
3938167 we cant tell what were performing but it will be our second single
3938168 i think it is more urban im working with producers who are just amazing

3938179 youre not guaranteed the senior coaching position but if you make good decisions generally in life and coaching you will tick most of the boxes
3938180 im pretty confident i can do a fantastic job id back myself to have these boys battle ready for afl in 2011
3938181 if the board think ive done a good job im a chance to be sitting in the chair in 2011 if they dont im not here
3938182 the only concern id have is if i wasnt doing a good job
3938183 i am very confident he will become such an important member of the team that it will be difficult for us to look elsewhere
3938184 its that character in guy to go out take some risks and back yourself that im very attracted to if all goes well lets look for a pretty rosy future together thats my attitude
3938185 the opportunity was one that i didnt want to pass up
3938186 its a journey im very excited about in the history of the afl there hasnt been an opportunity for a coach to come in and have two and a half years to develop and mould a side
3938187 it was just to show how serious we are and let the players know that how they played against carlton was unacceptable and embarrassing
3938188 i suppose you could say it was a bit of a reality check for the players a bit of a wake up call but we feel it was something that had to be done
3938189 i think thats just the third time weve done it but a point had to be made because what we saw last saturday against carlton wasnt good enough
3938190 i dont think the groundsmen were too happy with us because it was pretty muddy and the oval got churned up
3938191 but everyone got through it ok apart from the injured guys who did some work on the side
3938192 without giving too much away lets just say it was one of those good tough old fashioned port adelaide training sessions
3938193 we were disappointed with the way we played last week so im sure it was to make sure all the boys have got their heads screwed on this week
3938194 our effort needs to be a lot greater than last week and if we can match collingwood for effort and contested ball then our skill level and talent should be able to get us a win get the best of foxtel

3938200 i feel that i have taken petrowest as far as i can and it is now time to step aside and allow another ceo to take it to the next level
3938201 as a significant unitholder and as a continuing director i look forward to working with the new ceo
3938202 ken was instrumental in the creation of petrowest and in bringing together a group of private companies that are well positioned to deliver strong performances
3938203 we thank ken for his dedication and commitment to building value despite numerous industry challenges his insight and vision of what petrowest can and will be has set the stage for a strong recovery
3938204 since he wasnt aware of his actions and was manipulated into destroying an entire species should he be punished or locked up to ensure that no one else can aim the gun that is ender at someone else

3938209 shes been waiting for it for four years so that was huge
3938210 on any given day anybody can win especially in track you can fall you can slip pull up anything anything can happen you cant take it for granted
3938211 the reason last season was such a wonderful thing was that it was great for football it is the all american success story
3938212 the greatest thing about it is that nobody expected it we can go all the way back and talk about the parade and why the people were the way they were they were ecstatic and they were hanging off buildings nobody worked it was because no one expected it
3938213 this is not a case of misconduct that warrants this type of action
3938214 certainly the timing is quite unfortunate because it is near the beginning of the school year
3938215 it was a unanimous vote of the school board after careful consideration beyond that i dont really want to comment
3938216 the district when it became aware of issues investigated and when it became ripe the board acted
3938217 i would classify them as flirting between two consenting adults
3938218 they said something to the effect of you look hot and cant wait to see you
3938219 this is the first i have heard about this situation
3938220 this is completely unfair to leave us parents wondering what has taken place and not allow us to make and voice our own opinion in support for or against the school boards decision
3938221 at present influenza immunity relates only to specific strains and simply does not exist in the event of a new pandemic outbreak the ongoing outbreaks and spread of the highly pathogenic h5n1 virus in poultry and wild birds have led to fears that a subtype that is transmissible from human to human could emerge therefore the ability to detect and type influenza virus immediately is essential in setting up appropriate controls as quickly as possible to minimise the spread of any potential pandemic virus
3938222 facebook has done an exceptional job of leveraging its brand internationally during the past year
3938223 by increasing the sites relevance to local markets through local language interface translation the site is now competing strongly or even capturing the lead in several markets where it had a relatively minor presence just a year ago
3938224 during the past year many of the top social networking sites have demonstrated rapid growth in their global user bases
3938225 facebooks recent ascension to become the top global social networking site has been spurred by its substantial growth across worldwide regions
3938226 suffering is the single greatest challenge to the christian faith
3938227 a lot of those exciting players who get questioned normally bounce back i think he would have copped a fair bit in the newspapers in melbourne they are pretty brutal down there when it comes to a high profile player who has dropped off a bit
3938228 the bulldogs have been up there for pretty much most of the year they might have dropped off a little bit in the last couple of weeks
3938229 but they are a good team and to expect them to come here half hearted would be wrong

3938235 i hope all the unselected candidates will give full support and work together in mobilising the partys machinery to ensure bn s victory during the campaign dont push aside the selected candidate although in our division we are not supporting him
3938236 we have to strive to achieve success and we should not entertain other considerations and we should not think who will become umno division chief and so on instead think of the strategy to win this by election
3938237 scientists and engineers should not be involved in these kinds of ethical questions
3938238 we all recall of course john mccains outrage when the united states violated this rule back in 2003

3938240 the situation in georgia remains fluid and dangerous as soon as possible my colleagues senators lieberman and graham will be traveling to georgia theyre both members of the senate armed services committee i hope that other members of the armed services committee in the senate will go together

3938246 but when it comes to anti semitism i think were on the same page
3938247 we mentioned our concerns about anti semitism and asked him what his position was
3938248 and he said he was certainly not an anti semite
3938249 all forms of anti semitism discrimination against minorities and anti muslim sentiment

3938251 id like to see you write a follow up on who should take advantage of this credit
3938252 being that its a loan it obviously isnt going to be economical for everyone
3938253 i am not in any way struggling to pay my mortgage and i dont have credit card debt
3938254 sure i need a lawn mower and i wouldnt mind the boost in my savings since my down payment wiped me out but is this tax credit really economical if i dont really need the money for anything except immediate gratification
3938255 the result is that families leverage their future retirement security to ease their present financial insecurity
3938256 robbing tomorrow to pay for today economically squeezed families are turning to their 401 k s to make ends meet
3938257 with other venues to borrow money particularly home equity lines closed off due to lower house prices tighter credit standards and slower income growth families are turning increasingly to the easily accessible loans from their 401 k plans
3938258 managers who lead with levity benefit from higher levels of employee engagement and overall success
3938259 we have a saying that in the tax arena procrastination costs

3938264 contrary to conventional wisdom mortgages can actually be a wealth building tool for boomers throughout their retirement years
3938265 in addition to their tax benefits mortgages help free up funds that otherwise would be tied up in property ownership for investment in equities
3938266 well if you spend more money than you make you know what happens and it can happen
3938267 the word alone causes peoples blood pressure to rise its a hard sounding word phonetically in sync with its impact on peoples lives
3938268 up to our eyeballs how shady lenders and failed economic policies are drowning americans in debt
3938269 set free by two decades of deregulation todays creditors have cooked up products that are so complicated deceptive and trap laden that even the most sophisticated borrowers cant tell a good loan from a bad one
3938270 to shine a light on how much we make how much we spend how much we owe and how much weve got secretly socked away is to give others a potent glimpse into the values we live by
3938271 admitting to money troubles can often feel like admitting to a weakness of character
3938272 we might be able to talk to you and find a way to set up something that fits your budget
3938273 the consumer has the right to pay whatever they can pay
3938274 dont allow yourself to be bullied by anyone asking for your money
3938275 do what you can do and if that is not acceptable its unfortunate for that credit grantor
3938276 if you have cash in hand you are more likely to obtain a reasonable settlement than a promise to pay something in the future
3938277 you have already broken a promise to pay in the future so cash today really talks
3938278 were going to get a 7 500 plus tax refund im not sure how thats possible but i triple checked our return should we use the refund to pay down our mortgage
3938279 the decrease in the second quarter of 2008 shows that the vc investment spend has been hindered by the macro events in the economy

3938287 alfys not brave i feel his tenseness beneath me ive never seen him more terrified yet somethings driving him to attack the hydra did you notice how the hydra burns
3938288 well go at the hydra with our swords and keep it busy while alfy breathes fire against the creature as long as he can
3938289 just breath fire hold your nose as tight as you can and have your dragon breathe fire
3938290 fff fff fff i dont know but if im right well all know soon enough
3938291 i am now recognising in both the one dayers and the tests i am one of the more senior players and that i need to go out and play like that
3938292 its an exciting thing for me to be seen as one of the senior players and to go out there and have a responsibility to deliver its a role im looking forward to having for a while to try to lead by example
3938293 its something i want to do as i have played enough test matches i have made a switch in the batting order from five to three and there is an opportunity to cement my place
3938294 it has been like that in the one dayers for a while and it is something i have enjoyed and i have been able to be very vocal in team meetings
3938295 hopefully it will be the same in the test matches and my performances against south africa the form team in world cricket show i have improved this summer i am desperate for that to continue
3938296 the ability is in the dressing room to win the ashes i dont think anyone would doubt that
3938297 the one thing we need to do as a side which we havent done too well is to be consistent
3938298 we scored almost 600 at lords and then followed that up by scoring 200 twice in the first innings of the next two tests
3938299 the audience is every four years for the olympics or when lance armstrong was winning the tours thats american cycling so i hope that winning a gold medal will bring the fans out for more than just one day every four years
3938300 we both come from a triathlon background we both have the same mentality
3938301 and what lance has done for the sport hes done wonderful things and hes also done wonderful things for the cancer foundation and i hope to follow in his footsteps and be that sort of role model for our country and up and coming riders
3938302 when i was his age i was carrying three sets of pads
3938303 im glad ive been here going on my ninth year
3938304 theres only four of us who have been here that long

3938306 any time you add a brett favre to your team it never hurts
3938307 hes going into this ninth year too hes been a starting quarterback for a long time hes going to help the team
3938308 we know what we can do its not about lining up in formation and running a play now its about getting into a better play than the one we called in the huddle and running the one we like the best
3938309 from day one weve been way ahead of last year
3938310 we are working on timing of plays that we are running a lot of which we didnt run against baltimore
3938311 all those things were kind of on the hit parade and we will continue to work on those things about 20 percent of the time and the other 80 percent will be geared towards things that tampa bay does

3938315 i tend to liken it to maybe a nascar race
3938316 weve improved at the world cups this team overall is going in the right direction on the track i dont think theres any doubt about that we have what i would consider veterans in both jennie and sarah taylors a newbie but hes a heck of a one and i think our mens sprinters are even stepping up overall we have some expectations
3938317 we have water sunshine we even have an active volcano wehave more energy than we need for our development
3938318 we will be fighting 100 percent against co2 at the samedate that you the g8 rich nations will be at 50 percent

3938422 it is an honor for the hartwell foundation to provide financial support to this outstanding researcher the competition for awards this year was remarkable making the final selection very difficult
3938423 by activating the nanoparticles with ultrasound we can hopefully get a more targeted and more sustained release of the chemotherapy drugs this will potentially provide for fewer treatments with the same efficacy
3938424 the clinician is faced with a difficult catch 22 wait until the child is older and risk that the tumor cant be controlled or treat at an early age knowing that there will be permanent damage because our treatment approach obviates the need for radiation these side effects from radiation are not a concern children who are most sensitive to these side effects stand to benefit the most
3938425 this new project will allow him to harness that prior expertise with a new concept for brain tumor therapy that could revolutionize our ability to help patients with this disease it is a terrific example of how biomedical engineering can help bridge the gap between complex diseases and the new technologies needed to treat them

3938436 eaa and other general aviation organizations have voiced opposition to this mandatory training requirement
3938437 like it or not the mandatory awareness training is the least onerous intervention the government can take on incursions
3938438 and if incursions continue after this training requirement has been in place for a while well have an even more difficult time opposing those who want to greatly increase restricted areas so its really up to us to become more vigilant about this

3938455 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3938456 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3938457 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3938458 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3938459 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3938460 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3938461 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3938462 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3938463 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3938464 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3938465 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3938466 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3938467 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3938468 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3938469 our own record checking procedures we identified an issue pertaining to one step of the modification
3938470 we are now working with boeing on the best way to carry out the rectification work to get the aircraft back into service as quickly as possible
3938471 our increased profit after tax guidance is indicative of our ability to manage our business throughout the economic cycle in particular in times of slower consumer spending which we have experienced in the third quarter and particularly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 chief executive mark mcinnes said
3938472 all states showed a softening in sales growth in the second half with the fourth quarter being notable for its volatility mr mcinnes said
3938473 very challenging but trading picked up in july due to a combination of school holidays and cold weather
3938474 we were anticipating a slowdown and had started planning for it more than 18 months ago mr mcinnes said
3938475 as part of the planning process we ensured that each key component of our business was prepared for a soft retail environment
3938476 this means we are well placed to deliver our gross profit margins within our target range of 39 5 per cent to 40 per cent throughout fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2012 mr mcinnes said
3938477 utilised the month of july to clear out any remaining surplus winter stock mr mcinnes said
3938478 we are now in the position of our year end stock in 2008 being eight per cent lower than in fiscal 2007 which means we have a very clean inventory position entering into into fiscal 2009
3938479 as we had expected we experienced volatile retail conditions in the second half mr mcinnes said
3938480 we have a proven business model a strong cash position clean inventory levels an established cost efficiencies program and opportunities for growth
3938481 we believe our company has a bright future and that we are well positioned to continue our track record of delivering year on year growth in shareholder returns mr mcinnes said
3938482 its been a long long journey so long that a whole book was written about a part of it its obvious to anyone who is familiar with the story and the history that it is one of the project that to make an understatement did not turn out the way it was originally planned
3938483 if you view it from the point of view as something that would replace outlook and exchange it has completely and utterly failed
3938484 last january i reached the conclusion that i was really ready and needing to go on to other things and the team on the project had a really strong desire to see it through to competition the team shrank in size pretty dramatically then i put a little more money into it in order to enable this transition to happen in 2008 part of which was they were going to ship 1 0
3938485 you asked if chandler has lived up to the dream i had six years ago and i think the fair answer to that is in part yes and in part no what has actually been delivered delivers on part of what the original dream was theres a cross platform fully open source innovative personal information manager with a very strong calendar those were among the original goals obviously its taken dramatically longer than i thought it would which i would attribute to not good judgment about how long it would take or the complexity of the project
3938486 its more of a conventional open source project in the sense that its momentum hereon is going to depend on the extent there is a community of volunteers who find it valuable enough to contribute to it and move it forward
3938487 the short answer is i dont know but there are promising signs the numbers of people involved while modest are non trivial and growing if you view it from the point of view as something that would replace outlook and exchange it has completely and utterly failed but from the point of view of having built something that tens of thousands of people are happily using and were using before there was a 1 0 by those metrics its pretty promising
3938488 well yeah actually its easy when youve been successful to lose calibration about what you can accomplish about how hard it can be about how long it will take theres lots of people on the second time around that have dug themselves into one or another kind of hole part of what allowed chandler to get traction and to get to 1 0 was when people on the project myself included where able to have more modest objectives to have more realistic planning and to get into a more agile cycle of development on the principle it is far better to deliver something than it is to have huge dreams and deliver nothing that would be my advice
3938489 when it gonna be my turn to be in a show when can i get a ribbon momma why sissy get to do dis and i dont
3938490 when youre bigger when you can freaking post a trot my friend
3938491 you have to trot and you have to post that means go up and down in the saddle you have to do that before you can be in a show
3938492 yeah but if i buy show gear and pay entry fee for a two year old that would make me
3938493 what do you mean everybody knows about roo all of you
3938494 we strongly encourage the committee to develop and evaluate a scenario that places tolls on both sr 520 and i 90 on 2010
3938495 im like every taxpayer everything sounds like too much to me that sounds expensive
3938496 theyve got to think usually you dont want to pay for something thats not already there let us pay for it after its built
3938497 you wont find anyone who will say gee golly i want to pay tolls
3938498 we want as many cooks as we can get in this kitchen
3938499 the true peaceful face of islam stresses that the word
3938500 we continued to build our alternative asset management business in the quarter with our fundraising efforts for onex partners iii
3938501 two closings of third party capital for that fund totalling over us 2 4 billion were successfully completed and we believe that we are on track to conclude that fundraising in early 2009
3938502 there is very very little liquidity in the credit markets and its not readily available
3938503 the pricing of it has moved up fairly meaningfully in the last few months theres really no change for the better that is clear
3938504 this is what it costs this is what youll get out of it and here are the problems
3938505 i think theres an increased demand for growing organic and its something were hoping we can do
3938506 we have to find niches to fill and this seems to be one that maybe would work for us
3938507 once the farm gets going i think this is a viable way of producing vegetables also

3938515 id like to see you write a follow up on who should take advantage of this credit

3938517 i am not in any way struggling to pay my mortgage and i dont have credit card debt
3938518 sure i need a lawn mower and i wouldnt mind the boost in my savings since my down payment wiped me out but is this tax credit really economical if i dont really need the money for anything except immediate gratification

3938520 i prefer to store the memories that still linger of open spaces fields and watermelons olive and almond trees
3938521 i remember the horse that was tied to the mulberry tree in the yard and how i climbed on to it and was thrown off and got a beating from my mother i remember the butterflies and the clear feeling that everything was open the village stood on a hill and everything was spread out below
3938522 the cost of fuel is clearly hitting new zealanders hard enough to make them change their behaviour
3938523 the fact that this latest poll was taken in winter is also interesting as youd expect people would turn to their cars more when the weather is bad
3938524 perhaps it shows that we often drive our cars short distances that could easily be walked instead
3938525 at the core of liberalism is the spoiled child miserable as all spoiled children are unsatisfied demanding ill disciplined despotic and useless liberalism is a philosophy of sniveling brats

3938530 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
3938531 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
3938532 this is a simplified version of what goes on in the human brain where we can look and control the basic features in the way that we want in a human brain you cant really do that
3938533 this is all the stuff that came out of it
3938534 id say there are two gallons of water and maybe half a gallon of gasoline
3938535 i dont know how many cars were talking about here but this could get pretty costly
3938536 if you had a problem the right thing to do is let people know

3938554 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work

3938613 i think weve frankly gone about as far as we can go
3938614 real wages adjusted for inflation are falling and there is no sign at all of any change in direction
3938615 what have we already sacrificed and what are we willing to take back

3938620 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3938621 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3938622 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3938623 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3938624 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3938625 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3938626 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3938627 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3938628 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3938629 its what you learn after you know it all that counts
3938630 if we dont change direction soon well end up where were going
3938631 ponder the path of your feet and let all your ways be established
3938632 if you board the wrong train it is no use running along the corridor in the other direction
3938633 nearly 80 of the land that is currently being leased by oil companies for drilling in the u s are not being used for this purpose
3938634 thats why charlie will lead the fight to end americas dependence on the worlds most unstable regions for oil by investing in domestic energy production
3938635 the new owner will owe 3 900 in property taxes in 2009 on her 1 purchase unless she challenges the tax assessment

3938648 ive been reading what ryan has been saying to the media and i want to say the other side of it hes blaming the driver when i think that there are poor management practices that are actually to blame for the accident
3938649 ryan hashagen of bellingham the companys owner said the brakes of the three wheeled touring vehicle were working properly and that the driver should never have taken the pedicab down such a steep slope
3938650 our heart goes out to all those affected by this incident
3938651 we want to get to the bottom of this situation as much as anyone we are conducting a full investigation into what has occurred we are cooperating with all relevant local authorities investigating this incident

3938658 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3938659 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
3938660 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
3938661 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
3938662 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
3938663 but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3938664 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media
3938665 he said its not that its not that i obviously was joking on that i said look im not here to take chads spot or replace him or whatever it is what it is
3938666 i said this the other day i dont think ive ever beaten chad
3938667 until i hear anything else thats the way im looking at it right now
3938668 im focusing on football until i hear anything else ill assume its over

3938676 virtual assistant i know i need one but where do i begin
3938677 there are thousands on the web where do i begin
3938678 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3938679 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3938680 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3938681 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3938682 i dont know but i sure dont like those who ask that question
3938683 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3938684 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
3938685 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3938686 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
3938687 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3938688 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3938689 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
3938690 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
3938691 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
3938692 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
3938693 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
3938694 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
3938695 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
3938696 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
3938697 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3938698 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3938699 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3938700 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3938701 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3938702 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
3938703 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3938704 the right information has to be given to the people
3938705 yang peiyi missed out on selection to appear at the ceremony because of her external appearance it was for the national interest
3938706 i think there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic director picked the best voice and the best performer
3938707 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great
3938708 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
3938709 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3938710 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
3938711 i think the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world
3938712 chens original interview was posted on beijing radios web site sunday night by tuesday the link was shut down the chinese government routinely blocks sites that are politically sensitive or that could cause embarrassment to the countrys communist rulers

3938724 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3938725 saakashvili was crazy enough to go in the middle of the night and bomb a city
3938726 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran over elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilians alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3938749 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
3938750 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
3938751 this is not a case of misconduct that warrants this type of action
3938752 certainly the timing is quite unfortunate because it is near the beginning of the school year
3938753 it was a unanimous vote of the school board after careful consideration beyond that i dont really want to comment
3938754 the district when it became aware of issues investigated and when it became ripe the board acted
3938755 i would classify them as flirting between two consenting adults
3938756 they said something to the effect of you look hot and cant wait to see you
3938757 this is the first i have heard about this situation
3938758 this is completely unfair to leave us parents wondering what has taken place and not allow us to make and voice our own opinion in support for or against the school boards decision

3938781 it kind of offended my notion of justice you can serve your time and still have your rights taken away i studied the history of black disenfranchisement in the state we had the grandfather laws and the tissue paper ballots when a black man came to vote they gave him a tissue paper ballot that was later thrown out there were lynchings and riots weve got a long history of depriving people of the right to vote in florida
3938782 we hope to set a model for other denominations about how to face this dark tragic part of our history because we believe that only when you repent can you move on
3938783 im just angry cause who in their right mind would want to start a fire you know they could have killed somebody i thank god everyday everyone came out alive my kids my neighbors
3938784 my kids are standing across the street with nothing little shorts on with no shoes i looked and everything was gone i asked my husband did you get their shoes but we got nothing
3938785 i hope to share how people could make a presence in the blogosphere and perhaps earn a little without having to be so gung ho

3938792 we have had 10 000 police officers killed or injured trying to bring peace to our communities
3938793 mates lets be proud as a rat with a gold tooth
3938794 i believe that this war is lost and this surge is not accomplishing anything as is shown by the extreme violence in iraq this week
3938795 youre in air force country now i got you everythings going to be ok
3938796 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3938797 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3938798 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3938799 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3938800 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3938801 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3938802 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
3938803 its amazing because theyve been such a big influence ever since we grew up
3938804 its kind of too good to be true i was like a little giddy kid at christmas when i heard that we got to do this tour
3938805 were used to doing little pub shows running in trying to get sound ready but this was really easy we got treated super nice
3938806 daltry and townshend they dont actually interact much because theyve been there and done that so they kind of get driven to the stage they do their show and they kind of get driven away
3938807 the purpose of the talk and the paper is to make clear just how dire the situation is and how rapidly things are getting worse
3938808 its a lot like the issue of climate change that we had ignored for so long if anything the situation in the oceans could be worse because we are so close to the precipice in many ways
3938809 all of the different kinds of data and methods of analysis point in the same direction of drastic and increasingly rapid degradation of marine ecosystems
3938810 just as we say that leatherback turtles are critically endangered i looked at entire ecosystems as if they were a species
3938811 the reality is that if we want to have coral reefs in the future were going to have to behave that way and recognize the magnitude of the response thats necessary to achieve it
3938812 the challenges of bringing these threats under control are enormously complex and will require fundamental changes in fisheries agricultural practices and the ways we obtain energy for everything we do
3938813 so its not a happy picture and the only way to deal with it is in segments the only way to keep ones sanity and try to achieve real success is to carve out sectors of the problem that can be addressed in effective terms and get on it as quickly as possible
3938814 our amnesia about what is natural is the greatest threat to the environment
3938815 some may say that it is irresponsible to make such predictions pending further detailed study to be sure of every point however we will never be certain about every detail and it would be irresponsible to remain silent in the face of what we already know
3938816 lack of political will and the greed of special interests
3938817 simply enforcing the standards of the magnuson stevens act and the u s national marine fisheries service would result in major improvements in u s waters within a decade
3938818 discard is a terrible practice in addition to the moral aspects of this sheer waste of food discards lead to unrecorded catches which lead to incorrect fisheries statistics which again disrupt the basis for scientific assessments of stocks and scientific advice on management
3938819 the best scientific advice is that we shouldnt be fishing for cod at all because stocks have been so depleted in the north sea and yet here we have tons of fish being dumped overboard
3938820 discard is happening all the time but normally it takes place at sea where nobody can see what is happening this incident has to be multiplied many many times to get an idea of the scale of the waste
3938821 the fishermen would say it happens because quotas are too small and they have to throw fish back but you would have to be insane to agree with that argument
3938822 it is morally wrong and its just p ing in your own bed this has been illegal in norway since the eighties and the boat would have been arrested had it done it in the norwegian sector it is just calculated environmental criminality the whole thing is very provocative disappointing and shocking
3938823 the system forces fishermen to go to a place they are unfamiliar with to seek the fish they have quotas for unfortunately in this case they landed a quantity of saithe which they didnt have a quota for
3938824 if they had dumped it there and then they would have been breaking norwegian laws and if they had landed it back in the uk they would have been fined
3938825 they did the only think they could do which was to steam 100 miles away wasting time and fuel to an area where they hoped to find the type of fish they are entitled to catch and where they could legally dump the saithe
3938826 this is a horrible indictment of the system fishermen have to operate under these are young men under massive pressures trying to make a living no fisherman wants to dump fish his job is to find fish for people to eat not to see it thrown over the side
3938827 throwing dead fish back into the sea is a waste that nobody wants to see but there is no easy answer
3938828 uk fishermen have shown that they are committed to finding new ways of protecting vulnerable stocks and the european union has backed a uk action plan designed to reduce the amount of discards
3938829 the uk is keen to ensure more effective and sustainable fisheries by reducing by catch and discards and the government is working closely with fishermen to achieve that
3938830 discarding fish not only means a massive waste of food and potential income it also leads to unrecorded catches resulting in a poorer scientific basis for our management decisions
3938831 i want a requirement that all fish caught in norwegian waters also by foreign vessels must be taken to port regardless of which final port is used we will introduce new requirements as a condition for obtaining licenses to fish that vessels cannot discard valuable fish caught here
3938832 this must stop now the eu community cannot be taken seriously if it allows this kind of behaviour this is certainly not how to manage the worlds resources
3938833 it is a disgrace this practice is depleting populations that are already overfished and it is happening everywhere
3938834 all of these fish are perfectly marketable and have been legally caught but if you are a fisherman it makes more economic sense to take boat to market with the most saleable fish so you discard the lowest value stuff
3938835 it is out of contact we very rarely fish in norwegian waters thats the first time in years
3938836 the reason there are discards is the ridiculously low quotas fishermen cannot make a living with them they are at a ridiculous level
3938837 throwing dead fish back into the sea is a waste that nobody wants to see but there is no easy answer the uk is keen to ensure more effective and sustainable fisheries by reducing by catch and discards and the government is working closely with fishermen to achieve that
3938838 this is rabid anti gm misguidedly demonising gm results in the real issues being sidelined creating the very problems that prince charles is trying to address
3938839 there are several issues that have been muddled together resulting in serious dangers to the future direction of agriculture
3938840 he has confused the dominance of multinational companies and its consequences for food security with the use gm in agriculture if there were a total world ban on gm tomorrow it would have no effect at all on the dominance on big multinational companies
3938841 prince charles like many wealthy people has no concept of the hardships of other parts of the world he wants to retain his vision of a rural idyll by telling the poor to eat organic cake while he pours wine into the fuel tank of his sports car
3938842 he is using the privileged position of a prince of the realm to try to influence us with a one sided irresponsible view of food technology he is like a romantic 19th century poet writing and painting pictures of rural life
3938843 environmentalists have been saying for years all we need to do is redistribute wealth to feed the poor it has not happened so we have to produce more food the most effective way is through gm crops
3938844 i was shocked and saddened to read what prince charles said shocked because it was so ill informed one sided and generally negative
3938845 saddened because the prince is in a position to lead this country in solving some of the massive problems he identifies he could bring together our world class scientists and agricultural experts to catalyse constructive debate and action that would benefit the uk and the rest of the planet
3938846 instead he indulges in diatribes in which he appears to blame the problems of the planet on a single technological advance that he has completely misunderstood
3938847 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3938848 food security is an important issue we do need to evaluate a range of techniques and technologies which have been proposed for enhancing food crop production and the royal society is currently undertaking a study looking at this
3938849 if we go down this path i think we will put this country at risk there could be a period of great difficulty in the next 10 or 20 years
3938850 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3938851 prince charles has got a way of getting things absolutely wrong its an entirely luddite attitude to simply reject them out of hand
3938852 condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa
3938853 what all run by gigantic corporations is that really the answer i think not that would be the absolute destruction of everything
3938854 corporations are conducting a gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong why else are we facing all these challenges climate change and everything
3938855 the global livestock business is among the most damaging sectors to the earths increasingly scarce water resources
3938856 a nightmare vision in which millions of small farmers are driven off their land and into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness
3938857 these slums are filled with the unemployed and disaffected africas cities are becoming a powder keg of instability and discontent
3938858 we are missing the point we should be discussing food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3938859 we are deeply concerned that the steep rise in global food prices coupled with availability problems in a number of developing countries is threatening global food security
3938860 securing world food security may be one of the biggest challenges we face in this century
3938861 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3938862 small farmers would be the victims of gigantic corporations taking over the mass production of food
3938863 i have been to the punjab where you have seen the disasters that have taken place
3938864 today every farmer is in debt and despair vast stretches of land have become water logged desert
3938865 look at western australia huge salinisation problems i have been there seen it some of the excessive approaches to modern forms of agriculture
3938866 salinity is one of the greatest environmental threats facing western australias agricultural land water biodiversity and infrastructure it is caused by too much water containing dissolved salts in the wrong places in the landscape
3938867 guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3938868 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
3938869 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3938870 and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3938871 what all run by gigantic corporations is that really the answer i think not that would be the absolute destruction of everything and the classic way of ensuring that there is no food in the future
3938872 with nature we have gone working against nature for too long
3938873 its an entirely luddite attitude to simply reject them gm crops out of hand
3938874 prince charles should stick to his royal role rather than spout ing off about something which he has clearly got wrong
3938875 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present
3938876 gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world

3938882 some students love music and want to participate in our fine choral and instrumental programs some want to keep playing sports at a competitive level some come for passionate teachers who will open their minds to new ideas some like our rural setting and the community it engenders some come because we are a college of the church where it is possible to combine faith and learning most though have no idea how luther college will transform their lives
3938883 the best reason to go here for me is that although its a small school its spread out the campus is big so it never feels small the staff is friendly the academics are great the city is wonderful and its just a train ride away from chicago which gives easy access to the city
3938884 manhattan colleges strong sense of community academic support systems and location would be among the major reasons for choosing us
3938885 lyon college provides a warm friendly atmosphere that allows students to excel in areas other than the classroom the degree of personal growth and development that students experience while at lyon far exceeds that which would be possible at a larger college or university
3938886 lyon college offers a liberal arts education of superior quality in the beautiful environment of the ozark foothills where outdoor activities are abundant

3938901 in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone ive spent more time with
3938902 i would hope that my would join me in condemning this kind of politics although i support sen obama i would never be dumb enough to offer policy advice to either candidate they seem to be doing fine without me
3938903 it came in good faith from sources we believed we still trust our sources
3938904 had we had their denial we would have done a different story
3938905 one of the problems of this world is unringing a bell
3938906 she couldnt say well maybe well work through this for years or maybe we should separate for two years
3938907 the cancer forced her to choose whether to move forward
3938908 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
3938909 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt
3938910 jack reads to her an hour a day as part of his home schooling

3938914 i dont know how far the debris goes every time they tried to dig they would run into more they couldnt go any deeper they went about seven feet and theyre still pulling debris out
3938915 they told me that it will cost thousands of dollars to get it out of my backyard i dont have thousands of dollars to get this out of my backyard
3938916 i just closed on this house july 21st im not even unpacked and then we go to put our pool in and we dont even have a decent backyard

3938918 with one of the most influential presidential elections of recent history approaching the creative coalition is delighted to partner with ciara elend to further the involvement of entertainment leaders at both upcoming conventions this collaboration blurs party lines and allows us to heighten the awareness and importance of citizen action
3938919 i was fascinated by the support artists across the nation were lending to this election for both parties
3938920 after i came up with my initial concept i realized the ideal partner to bring this to fruition was the creative coalition
3938921 it is a great honor to partner with the creative coalition so much thought and hard work went into the design of this concept so it is very satisfying to have that recognized by such prominent members of the creative community
3938922 1 0 which on its own is an excellent strategy but we took into account all the feedback we received on the first version and upped the ante on the this latest release
3938923 vestas is one of the largest suppliers of turbines to guangdong nuclear and we are proud that they once again have decided to use vestas turbines it is a clear sign of the trust and professional working relations that have been building up between our two companies
3938924 shuts down the opposition media he could well try to divert attention away from his political problems by ginning up a fresh conflict with the breakaway regions of both of which are protected by russian troops and regional militias
3938925 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore
3938926 in the event of an outbreak of hostilities expect the u s to do what they have done for the duration of georgias political crisis proffer unconditional support to saakashvili with russia aiding and giving political and diplomatic support to the abkhazians and the ossetians and the americans letting loose a flood of military aid to tbilisi this could be the first theater of actual conflict in the
3938927 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
3938928 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3938929 im just planning out who i will be visiting with in september
3938930 shortly after that ill make a commitment im looking for a school to have a sincere interest in me and where ill have the opportunity to play and get a great education i also want to be around good people
3938931 he can defend a two shooting guard to a four power forward i think hes an underrated athlete hes more explosive than people think hes bouncy off one feet hes bouncy off two
3938932 those are the main areas he also competes every play and he shoots better off the dribble than people give him credit for he can catch and shoot and he does attack the basket
3938933 givon is looking at dane miller class of 2009 and pat jackson class of 2008
3938934 they have depth in the wing position he wants to go somewhere and play and not look over his shoulder rutgers looks at him as a primary shooter
3938935 but he loves assistant coach craig carter its the big east and they are rebuilding they have a lot of pieces and they are recruiting he takes a look at the wing position he wants to play with guys hes familiar with and he might want to be a part of that
3938936 tapi sekarang sudah diperbaiki 80 persen sebagian besar menggunakan dana alokasi khusus melalui apbd pada 2008 ini ada 66 sekolah yang nilainya masing masing rp 150 juta
3938937 we have seen more and more russian troops coming into the area all day a continuous build up of forces including columns of tanks and truck all along the roads here
3938938 they came into this area and destroyed six georgian vessels
3938939 from what we understand they came with the specific task of destroying all the military facilities of the georgians
3938940 poti is one of the most important ports in the black sea
3938941 the offensive means that the ceasefire is dead back to ground zero
3938942 no more than 100 metres away is an armoured personnel carrier with three russian soldiers on top behind that there is a long convoy of russian military vehicles
3938943 the fact russian forces have moved so far into georgian territory will be seen as an act of provocation
3938944 theyre not moving at a fast speed but they are moving towards tbilisi
3938945 it is only 60km from gori to tbilisi but this doesnt look like an invasion force
3938946 this seems to have overstepped the bounds of the russian side of the ceasefire they had pledged not to move from their positions and to stop firing
3938947 these are disturbing developments given all the work that was done by the eu yesterday
3938948 we have heard from our colleagues on the ground that this isnt the case
3938949 russian occupying forces were continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
3938950 georgian forces have begun their pullback towards tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3938951 we are still obliged to fulfil our mission by taking out firing positions snipers and so on
3938952 i myself saw three personnel carriers on the edge of the town but there was no doubt they were moving towards gori
3938953 neither russian peacekeepers nor any units subordinate to them are present in gori
3938954 we created plenty of chances and always looked to get the ball forward
3938955 but were a work in progress theres still things to work on and it certainly wasnt a perfect performance
3938956 theres still 90 minutes to play the second leg will be very different and will be played in different circumstances
3938957 well play to our people and at the vicente calderon we are confident that we can win
3938958 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
3938959 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
3938960 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
3938961 dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars
3938962 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins

3938977 when seven throws to the website we see an immediate spike in traffic
3938978 thirty per cent of tv viewers are online at the same time
3938979 its certainly being demonstrated that that audience is using the web to give them extra information
3938980 its almost not worth putting standard definition televisions on the floor even at 89 people are just not interested
3938981 in all of our stores hdtv sales are up between 10 and 40 per cent and probably by at least 40 per cent in the last few weeks
3938982 it is the only product i can think of at the moment that is selling like hotcakes
3938983 we have sold more than three times what i would have expected and again i think the olympics have been a factor
3938984 i didnt think tivo would be a big seller sometimes you just never know
3938985 we really didnt get any data that made us feel any better about the financials
3938986 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
3938987 the way through this is to try to look at everything a little bit further down the road and just buckle up because its going to be a pretty wild ride
3938988 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3938989 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
3938990 i do not have time to waste on bill kristols musings
3938991 i am not going to the convention i have made this clear

3938996 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3938997 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3938998 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3938999 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3939000 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3939001 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3939002 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3939003 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3939032 spike said you two were an item so i knew and i dont care
3939033 sit woman before you collapse i can smell your exhaustion kagome you find out what she wants im making something to drink
3939034 was that even an offer to get me something to drink
3939035 do you want tea or coffee or soda or water
3939036 strong thank you ive been going for two days without sleep
3939037 and he can also hear you even in the kitchen
3939038 but i wont ask him ever to like you or forgive you
3939039 word has it that you two have been making a major dent in the bad guy population around here
3939040 its something to do on friday nights what can i say buffy why are you here
3939041 we need a heavy hitter to take out a bad guy kagome your name came up
3939042 very bad apocalyptically end the world nasty bad with a big emphasis on nasty
3939043 he even fetches the paper from the driveway in the morning sits on command too
3939044 what makes you think id help and kagome sure as hell aint
3939045 inuyasha dont make me do it i will youre worrying buffy
3939046 maybe she should be scared stupid bitch thinks she can just waltz in here and ask us to help her
3939047 we both have reasons to mistrust one another inuyasha do you think its really all that easy for me to come here
3939048 yknow did it ever occur to you that if the circumstances were different the three of us might have been friends were on the same side were fighting the same good fight and weve much in common the three of us
3939049 feh fair folk not like the demons you usually fight more like youkai my fathers people
3939050 didnt know any of them were alive in this world in this day theyre dangerous
3939051 i led a force of about two hundred slayers and a few dozen others against them two weeks ago some of us survived most of the unseelie didnt we tracked their damned prince or at least his credit cards here
3939052 she is she cant you cant turn away from this
3939053 kagome are you okay because if you want away from him we can help you hed never find you
3939054 buffy dont worry about me not that way not ever not from inuyasha
3939055 buffy youre right about us that in another world another time another place the three of us might have been friends but im not sure inuyasha will ever forgive you for what you did to his wife and to him and for the girls he had to kill to survive
3939056 hai and sometimes i think that eats at him worst of all
3939057 buffy all youve ever seen of inuyasha is the anger in him i wish you could know him as he really is but im not sure hell ever forgive you enough to let his guard down around you
3939058 if you ever do need help youre one of us we help our own
3939059 yes we fight the same fight tell me about these unseelie
3939060 the short explanation is that they were stealing children to sacrifice to open a new hellmouth under new york city
3939061 word is between you guys and angel and spike theyve decided los angeles is a lost cause though why theyd think new york city was going to be easier lets just say we had some pretty big league help taking them out that city has no shortage of heroes
3939062 unseelie are a lot like youkai from what ive read i should be able to purify them the same way
3939063 wil wants to work with you to catch prince federic thats the baddy we want to take out here hes gone underground somewhere in this area but we dont know where shes hoping she might be able to help you intensify your talents you could really help turn the tables towards our side
3939064 if i try to leave him behind and go fight something nasty without him hell only follow me
3939065 i dont want willow or somebody else getting the wrong idea and hurting him if he shows up unexpectedly if i help its with inuyasha openly at my side and i want your solemn promise that youll see to it that your people will not hurt him i will ask him to be low key because i know having him around will be quite disruptive and likely many of your people have issues with him but i want it known that hes working with me and hes under your protection
3939066 can would has to the ends of the earth and into hell itself if necessary id do the same for him without hesitation were two halves of a whole buffy
3939067 and we fight together very well as a team i honestly cant think of anyone id rather have watching my back in a fight inuyashas more likely to get myself and himself out of trouble alive than anyone else i know
3939068 can i ask you a question and get an honest answer
3939069 speaking of honest answers anyway do you seriously think inuyasha can restrain himself and not hurt anyone in a seriously hostile environment cause theyll hate him he might get a warmer reception from the unseelie than he will from my own people
3939070 buffy inuyashas been dealing with hatred his entire life it wont be anything new for him
3939071 youll have to worry about me a whole lot more than him if anyone gets out of line inuyasha will snap and snarl but his barks far worse than his bite he never hits first when its humans involved
3939072 hes pretty good at provoking people into hitting first though
3939073 i can tell them not to but i cant guarantee someone wont get stupid
3939074 if they attack him i think hell be fine hell defend himself of course but i would be highly surprised if hed let anyone push him over the edge he really doesnt want to go there again he was in a pretty bad place mentally for a long while there but i think hes doing better the exception would be if im threatened or one of his other friends like shippou or spike these days then all bets are off
3939075 anyone among my people dumb enough to attack a slayer with a half demon bodyguard of inuyashas power deserves what they get
3939076 the threat wont come from any of my scoobies my inner circle i can assure you that but theres over sixteen hundred girls now plus some other people weve picked up along the way and
3939077 angels been putting the girls up in his hotel well meet there about six tonight
3939078 with a soul dont worry i wont stake him noon then ill be there
3939079 you wouldnt be coming to me or accepting inuyasha fighting at my side if it wasnt serious and i told mr giles that id help if you needed me i expect sooner or later ill need the favor returned
3939080 particularly with you living here in la i swear this town has more outbreaks of weirdness
3939081 ill bring a couple of other people too will you have problems with a couple of full youkai coming with me
3939082 trust me shippous much better mannered than inuyasha he was raised by humans and hes one of my better friends i trust him implicitly he works for lorne you know lorne right and spike knows him as for kirara youre petting her now
3939083 kirara youll come right to a fight were going to be taking on a bad youkai
3939084 we dont give out numbers but were 50 per cent over the targets that we set for ourselves
3939085 it has the potential to be a bit of a watershed because the olympics is so mainstream
3939086 we expect that more and more people having used the olympics will sign up to other packages
3939087 the percentage of bigponds revenue that is content compared with access services is still relatively small it will be in the 15 per cent range
3939088 as devices become more sophisticated with the launch of the iphone and similar devices and bandwidth grows people are going online on their phone a lot more often
3939089 the two major trends driving growth have been in social networking and in mobile search
3939090 social networking is driving the bulk of our mobile traffic at the moment and its up 50pc over the quarter
3939091 youtube is now making up the bulk of our video streams
3939092 i dont think there is a lot of content that people want to pay for
3939093 weve had tremendous subscriber growth this year for all of our sports packs
3939094 theres other content thats nice to have but its not essential so people wont pay for it
3939095 people will pay for it we have a whole bunch of seinfeld episodes for sale interestingly drama doesnt seem to have worked quite so well weve tried a variety of things including nine network drama damages its hard to get deeply deeply involved for a long time with a mobile phone screen
3939096 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3939097 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3939098 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3939099 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3939100 youre going out there and trying to make the right calls so everyone is on the same page
3939101 i wouldnt say i have it down 100 percent but its definitely getting better every day
3939102 the second you think youve got it figured out the defense throws a new look at you i dont think anyone would ever say theyve got it totally down
3939103 its obvious hes been in his playbook a whole lot hes a smart guy hes making all the right calls getting the line going the right way a lot of times hes been on the same page as the quarterback a lot so hes doing a great job with that
3939104 yet through the scent of water it will bud and put forth boughs like a plant
3939105 image that tipped me over the edge was his half full box of washing powder sitting on the laundry window

3939110 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3939111 if indeed russia is violating a cease fire and i have to say the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the cease fire that will only serve to deepen the isolation to which russia is moving
3939112 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3939113 it was fantastic to do that album not only live with that music that i love everyday but i just worked with such wonderful musicians who are so talented
3939114 speed is a major factor which leads to many crashes and certainly has a direct effect on the outcome of any crash regardless of cause
3939115 the army has been called out and they are patrolling the streets
3939116 the protests are the manifestation of an anger that the peace process doesnt seem to have achieved anything
3939117 larry and i will have a bowl of mueslix and a small shot of prune choice and be in bed by 9 oclock
3939118 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3939119 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3939120 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3939121 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3939122 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3939123 the utah state university family has lost a valued and much loved member garys accomplishments were many and he will be missed our thoughts and condolences are with his family
3939124 saya setuju memang perlu payung hukum yang lebih kuat lagi supaya penyadapan jadi yang lebih baik

3939126 folks who arent goofing around and who can be trusted to say what they mean in relatively plain english
3939127 john mccain has been running ads associating me with britney spears and paris hilton he has been criticized for those ads but i believe they reflect a deep concern that i share with him
3939128 and i can hardly believe the appetite for news about paris and britney and now angelina and beyonce when there are wars going on and the earths climate is shifting dangerously and our people are losing jobs and health coverage
3939129 the celebrity culture is sexualized to a point that threatens anyone who tries to raise children to be responsible and caring human beings
3939130 i recognize that my family and i are in some danger of being sucked into the celebrity culture
3939131 the government cannot ban or censor celebrity culture it can support local civic engagement education and arts as alternatives and our leaders can speak out against the culture in this i would gladly join my republican opponent
3939132 may god bless her and all who sail in her
3939133 if a man is to be obsessed by something i suppose a boat is as good as anything perhaps a bit better than most
3939134 ships are the nearest thing to dreams that hands have ever made
3939135 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3939136 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3939137 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces
3939138 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states and europe and other nations russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3939139 we expect russia to honour its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
3939140 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces who have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3939141 were concerned about reports that russian forces have entered and taken positions in the port city of poti that russian armoured vehicles are blocking access to that port and that russian forces are blowing up georgian vessels
3939142 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years separatist official ruslan kishmaria said
3939143 most of the affected people have fled their homes with only the clothes on their back
3939144 so we dont know what is the condition of people who stayed in the conflict area
3939145 right now the access problem is a largely a political one
3939146 where is the usa and where is nato i guess people react differently depending on whos ox is being gored
3939147 id had relatively little experience with men by then you could count all the men id slept with on your fingers and toes and have a few left over
3939148 they called and i didnt really quite believe it i was hoping i was still asleep and it was a dream but it was for real
3939149 im sure she wouldnt have gone into that situation if she had known nothings worth that
3939150 shes made a huge difference in the world already but i think its just a tragedy a stupid waste that she should be brought to a halt so violently and so soon she had so much that she was offering people
3939151 in the last two three years she travelled at least half a year maybe more and to many different countries her suitcase was sort of installed at the top of the stairs always being unpacked or repacked or en route
3939152 she knew what she wanted she would work hard to get it she didnt suffer fools gladly she had a mission and she took it very seriously she had a huge smile she really loved life she loved travelling she loved seeing different countries
3939153 ive spoken with staff in afghanistan she was terribly well regarded very very well regarded by the staff and by the afghan community as i understand it
3939154 she was very hard working utterly compassionate and committed to her work a real believer in humanitarian assistance
3939155 she was a smart committed talented young woman who went to a difficult part of the world where the needs are extensive to apply the skills that she had acquired over the years in her education and professional experience
3939156 she was courageous compassionate lovely brave hard working and utterly committed to what she was doing
3939157 she was very very good at her work she really was as good as it gets as a humanitarian worker and as an individual and we are heartbroken and utterly grief stricken by her loss
3939158 her energy cheerfulness generosity and critical mind will be sorely missed by her colleagues in education and the feminist community at mcgill
3939159 knowing the risks associated with working in a conflict zone these humanitarian aid workers gave selflessly to help improve the lives of the afghan people
3939160 their spirits will live on in the continued efforts of all who are assisting in the reconstruction of afghanistan
3939161 we are absolutely outraged by this cowardly attack against humanitarian workers people who were in a marked humanitarian vehicle
3939162 they were unarmed obviously there was not a military convoy in sight and it is utterly reprehensible that they should be killed in this brutal inexplicable fashion
3939163 she was an expert in her field phd an internationally recognized authority on education education for women and girls especially in conflict settings
3939164 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3939165 they called and i didnt really quite believe it i was hoping i was still asleep and it was a dream but it was for real
3939166 shes made a huge difference in the world already but i think its just a tragedy a stupid waste that she should be brought to a halt so violently and so soon she had so much that she was offering people
3939167 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3939168 they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in the humanitarian community in afghanistan
3939169 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the dangers that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country
3939170 canada is recognized the world over for its compassion and generosity
3939171 both humanitarian aid workers shared these values and their convictions motivated them to contribute to afghanistans reconstruction efforts and to help maintain the hope for a better future that is so needed in a country that has been torn apart by years of hostility
3939172 she was utterly compassionate she was giving she was courageous and she was very very good at her work
3939173 she really was as good as it gets as a humanitarian worker and as an individual and we are heart broken and utterly grief stricken by her loss
3939174 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most
3939175 these things are not just made up the format of a curse or spell must be based on real examples from the classical period and reflect the beliefs of the practitioners
3939176 in their many guises magic and witchcraft have been important features of most societies whether approved of or feared by non practitioners
3939177 the questions that need to be asked of any tertiary education are what are they doing to create good citizens and what are they doing to ensure the skills are transferable
3939178 john mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption shows how far he is willing to go to win
3939179 despite all of his rhetoric about reform mccains willingness to accept money raised by tainted abramoff cronies like ralph reed shows that mccain simply cannot be trusted to bring change to washington politics
3939180 john mccain says he takes the high road and then he comes to atlanta and chows down on shrimp cocktail with an unindicted co conspirator
3939181 senator mccain knows exactly how ralph reed helped jack abramoff defraud indian tribes out of tens of millions of dollars
3939182 senator mccain should spare himself any further embarrassment by canceling this event immediately
3939183 raises serious questions about why he mccain didnt bring ralph reed before his committee was he concerned it would undercut his presidential campaign now you see ralph reed raising money for his campaign
3939184 ralph reed is not part of our fund raising organization in the state of georgia nor is he part of this event
3939185 i take the long view of politics which is that yesterdays opponent can be tomorrows friend or ally
3939186 i have found this to be the case with senator mccain i am supporting him because he is running on principled conservative positions on taxes judges terrorism energy values and the family i hold no position title or official role in the mccain campaign and am not seeking one
3939187 i was very intrigued when i heard reports that ralph reed was actively fund raising for mccain
3939188 i was curious as to whether or not senator mccain knew that ralph reed was actively fund raising for him

3939191 universal news launched universal news on demand in the beginning of 2007 to basically increase the efficiency and the sell through of the products that we already had in our stores
3939192 we didnt want to turn to publishers and say were okay with selling just 45 of your product which is actually higher than the industry average
3939193 i dont think theres anything more valuable than creating a discussion around a magazine cover

3939195 the shortage of staff has accelerated sharply with 39 fewer full time farm workers on uk farms than in 1999 this will take a long time to reverse but it needs to if we are not to have a crisis in 10 to 15 years we are told that the average age of farmers is touching 60
3939196 broken newel post kicked out rail cracked missing and half pried away stained glass windows were among the worst atrocities we spied
3939197 and of course three of the four fireplace mantels had been brutally yanked from their walls
3939198 onion domed towers and a wraparound porch with spindle work columns
3939199 the top advertisers already get that cables got a co lead role in their tv plans but i think whats shining a light on the growth of iconic programming makes it all a stronger play when they are getting their sales force pumped up for the coverage and the overall power of the brand
3939200 this years weak economy has resulted in extremely volatile ad markets with major advertisers scrambling to allocate budgets where they will get the most bang for the buck

3939290 ketika pada bulan ketiga yang baru lalu ini aku minggat dari tho hoa to dan aku pergi ke utara di sana aku telah menyamar sebagai pengemis
3939291 disepanjang jalan ada saja anjing yang menggonggong dan mengikuti aku hendak menggigit selalu aku hajar dia dengan dupakan lantas dia lari sambil menggoyang goyang ekornya

3939335 si bisa bangkotan menghendaki ynag tulen kau tulis yang palsu
3939336 ya yang palsu di jaman ini melainkan kau seorang yang ketahui kitab yang tulen dari itu apa pun yang kau kehendaki kau boleh tulis siapa yang akan ketahui itulah kitab yang tulen atau yang palsu kau menulis jungkir balik bunyinya kitab biar ia mempelajarinya menurut bunyi kitab yang palsu itu dengan begitu kendati pun sampai seratus tahun ia tak akan berhasil menyakinkan sekalipun satu jarus
3939337 auwyang hong sangat mahir ilmu suratnya kalau teecu menulis sembarangan lantas ia ketahui bagimana nantinya
3939338 tulis tiga baris yang benar lalu selipkan sebaris yang ngaco di bagian latihannya kau boleh tambahkan dan kurangi umpama kitab menyebut delapanbelas kali kau tulis duabelas kali atau duapuluh empat kali biarnya si bisa bangkotan sangat cerdik tidak nanti ia dapat melihatnya biarnya aku tidak gegares dan minum tujuh hari tujuh malam suka aku menonton si bisa bankotan itu mempelajari kitab palsu itu
3939339 bukan saja dia akan menyia nyiakan ketika akan bercapai lelah tidak puasnya ada kemungkinan dia nanti mendapat celaka karenanya
3939340 inilah cara mempermainkan orang yong jie dan ciu toako paling menggemarinya
3939341 sayang yang satu berpisah hidup yang lainnya berpisah mati kapan aku bisa bertemu pula dengan mereka supaya aku bisa menuturkan bagaimana aku mempermainkan si bisa bangkotan ini
3939342 aku si pengemis tua ilmu silatku telah menjadi satu partai tersendiri maka juga tidak aku termahai kiu im cin keng umpama kata kitab itu dibeber di depan mukaku tak nanti aku meliriknya cuma mereka yang tidak punya guna yang ilmu silatnya sendiri tidak karuan dia ingin sekali mencurinya sekarang kau kasih tahu paman anjingmu kiu im cin keng bakal ditulis untuknya biar ia menutup pintu mengeram diri untuk memahamlannya nanti sepuluh tahun kemudian biar ia muncul pula untuk mencoba menempur pula aku si pengemis tua kitab itu memang kitab bagus tetapi aku si pengemis tidak menghiraukannya lihat saja sesudah dia mendapatkan kitab itu apa dia bisa bikin terhadap aku si pengemis tua
3939343 kiranya si pengemis bangkotan sangat jumawa dia sangat mengandalkan kepandaiannya hingga ia suka menyerahkan kitab padaku kalau tidak ia tidak dapat dipaksa
3939344 ilmu kepandaian pamanku sudah sampai dipuncaknya kemahiran paman boleh pandai tetapi paman tidak nanti nempil dengannya perlu apakah dia mempelajari kiu im cin keng sering pamanku itu mengatakan kepadaku ia percaya kui im cin keng kitab kosong belaka melulu untuk mendustakan orang maka hendak ia melihatnya untuk ditunjuki bagian yang ngaco belo itu supaya semua ahli silat di kolong langit ini dapat mengetahui kekosongannya tidakkah pembeberan itu ada faedahnya untuk kaum rimba persilatan
3939345 anak ceng kau tulislah kiu im cin keng dan kau serahkan pada mereka ini jikalau si bisa bangkotan dapat menemui kekeliruan kekeliruan dari kitab itu nanti aku si pengemis tua berlutut dan mengangguk angguk di depannya
3939346 muridku menulis kitab untuknya ia menyuguhkan arak jempolan tetapi untuk aku si pengemis tua ia menyediakan arak yang tawar seperti air
3939347 mestinya si bisa bangkotan menyimpan araknya di dasar perahu baik aku meminumnya hingga puas habis itu tahangnya aku isi dengan air kencingku biar nanti ia mencicipinya
3939348 mungkinkah mereka hendak minum arak tapi kenapa mereka tidak menitahkan orangnya
3939349 apakah semua minyak dan belerang di semua ruang perahu ini sudah siap sedia
3939350 semua sudah siap asal api dipakai menyulut kapal besar ini akan segera menjadi abu hingga si pengemis tua bangka itu pun bakal mampus ketambus
3939351 pergi kau kumpuli semua gundik yang paling disayangi di dalam ruang sebentar kalo si bocah kwee sudah tidur pulas kau ajak semua ke perahu kecil aku sendiri yang nanti pergi kemari untuk menyalakan api
3939352 si pengemis busuk ada jago silat kenamaan kepala dari suatu partai pantas ada orang orang yang berkorban untuknya
3939353 paman lagi satu jam maka bocah she kwee itu bakal dikubur di dasar laut setelah mana di dalam dunia ini tinggallah kau seorang yang mengetahui isinya kitab kiu im cin keng
3939354 kalau tidak malaikat menyuruh aku mencuri arak mana aku ketahui aka keji dua orang ini
3939355 arak yang wangi arak yang wangi mari lagi sepuluh poci
3939356 tua bangka yang berbisa mari kita bertempur pula sampai seribu jurus untuk memastikan siapa tinggi siapa rendah oh oh bocah yang baik akur akur
3939357 lihat si pengemis bau tinggal mampusnya saja masih dia ngaco belo
3939358 jangan menanyakan sebabnya jalan dengan hati hati supaya jangan ada yang dapat melihat

3939360 dia ingin naik ke perahu kita nanti aku merampas yong jie
3939361 kau melindungi perahu ini supaya tidak sampai kena dirampas si tua bangka yang berbisa itu
3939362 kalau aku desak dia hingga dia terbakar kalau ia sampai mengantar jiwanya itu tak menarik hati
3939363 dia telah mendapatkan salinan kitab dari ceng jie jikalau dia tidak mendapat kesempatan untuk mempelajarinya bila nanti ia mampus pastilah ia mampus tak puas tidak dapat tidak dia mestinya dibikin kena batunya
3939364 sekarang tubuhku pun basah maka marilah kita berdua bertempur pula sekarang barulah adil sama rata sama rasa
3939365 seumur hidupnya si pengemis bangkotan ini hari barulah ia bertempur paling memuaskan
3939366 asal kau bergerak satu kali saja akan aku hajar hancur kepalanya
3939367 belajar golok seratus hari belajar tombak seratus hari belajar pedang selaksa hari
3939368 aku telah tolongi see tok mustahilkah ia menggunai tongkat ularnya mencelakai aku
3939369 lepaskan si pengemis tua cuma kau sendiri yang boleh naik
3939370 hati hati jikalau kau main gila aku nanti lelapkan kau di dalam air selama tiga jam
3939371 i block that out of my mind i dont worry about that
3939372 hes just an incredible athlete and i wish him the best
3939373 we actually hung out a little bit this offseason at some different events
3939374 were fine we talk like normal people we dont worry about the comparisons
3939375 hes going to be great in this league all the best to him
3939376 i know im far from it i know theres a lot of hard work focus determination and patience involved you have to go out there and continue to work your way through it
3939377 i dont because when i look back on it there were a lot of things that were left on the field that could have been better and that could have helped me out and could have helped the team out
3939378 i used to get to the top of my last step and sit and bounce now im sliding moving around keeping my feet live
3939379 im trying to keep my foundation keep my feet right when im throwing the ball downfield keeping my feet more active
3939380 his rookie year he relied a lot on his athletic ability and that a lot of teams didnt know what to expect of him
3939381 last year i think the defenses caught up with him playing spy techniques with linebackers and protecting the perimeters to keep him from rolling out i think he had to become a better student of the game and with heimderdinger he has
3939382 ive got to believe the same thing is going to happen
3939383 one thing that i thought stood out was that his feet were never underneath him when he threw and i think you need to have your feet underneath you in any sport you play so thats what we worked on to make him more accurate and he has become more accurate
3939384 hes such a good athlete that sometimes you say just go make a play and dont worry about it but in this league you have to be able to slide and find a window
3939385 i try to let the game come to me not take the game into my own hands
3939386 i know his first year he didnt scramble to throw the ball he was scrambling to run
3939387 now hes looking to see if he can find a receiver open hes showing a lot more accuracy hes hitting receivers in the numbers and thats what a quarterback should do
3939388 dontcha wish your kugel was crispy on top like mine
3939389 we are absolutely outraged by this cowardly attack against humanitarian workers people who were in a marked humanitarian vehicle
3939390 they were unarmed obviously there was not a military convoy in sight and it is utterly reprehensible that they should be killed in this brutal inexplicable fashion
3939391 she was an expert in her field phd an internationally recognized authority on education education for women and girls especially in conflict settings
3939392 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3939393 they called and i didnt really quite believe it i was hoping i was still asleep and it was a dream but it was for real
3939394 shes made a huge difference in the world already but i think its just a tragedy a stupid waste that she should be brought to a halt so violently and so soon she had so much that she was offering people
3939395 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3939396 they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in the humanitarian community in afghanistan
3939397 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the dangers that everybody there faces not just military people but all those who are there trying to help rebuild this country
3939398 canada is recognized the world over for its compassion and generosity
3939399 both humanitarian aid workers shared these values and their convictions motivated them to contribute to afghanistans reconstruction efforts and to help maintain the hope for a better future that is so needed in a country that has been torn apart by years of hostility
3939400 she was utterly compassionate she was giving she was courageous and she was very very good at her work
3939401 she really was as good as it gets as a humanitarian worker and as an individual and we are heart broken and utterly grief stricken by her loss
3939402 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most
3939403 who is modern and happy usa woman or india woman the reason im comparing with indian woman because number 1 im in indian and second rest of the wold think indian woman backward
3939404 the mccain campaign relies on big money lobbyists and theyll rely on him
3939405 in the you scratch my back world of washington 931 million gets the special interests the best government money can buy but just think of the payday these lobbyists might expect in a mccain administration
3939406 lets hope we never have another name on that wall
3939407 honra a tu padre y a tu madre para que todo lo que emprendas te vaya bien y tengas larga vida
3939408 there were many pedestrians from the party out on the footpath
3939409 they have been talking about it for four decades but that never seems to be enough
3939410 the government was quick to move for things like id cards or 42 day detention without trial now it needs to show similar leadership in public health
3939411 the threat to our future health is just as significant as the current security threat
3939412 lots of the initiatives are under a voluntary agreement but it has just come to the point where things like these are simply not working
3939413 lord darzis recent review envisioned an nhs that is as good at preventing ill health as it is at treating the sick
3939414 we are tackling obesity through awareness campaigns and action in schools our alcohol and sexual health campaigns encourage responsible drinking and safer sex
3939415 we set voluntary targets for salt and have seen considerable reductions in a range of food
3939416 these house republicans win the gold medal for wasted energy due to the hours they spent agitating for big oils ocean drilling agenda while opposing real clean energy solutions
3939417 meanwhile american families suffer from record gasoline and energy prices
3939418 conservatives in congress opposed relatively simple inexpensive new sources of energy while thirsting after americas beaches and coasts
3939419 renowned oil man t boone pickens is promoting wind power as a clean alternative to oil
3939420 he has said this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
3939421 yet conservatives continue their devotion to big oils demands for more of our coastal waters while opposing common sense clean energy solutions that can quickly provide energy
3939422 in the uk we have something called nhs direct there is an online service but i dont think you can type in symptoms but you can research conditions and illnesses
3939423 i read an interview with the owners of this virginia spa they said that when they did group pool sessions with the doctor fish some folks got lots of attention and some folks didnt
3939424 please would you mind killing me its what i live for

3939429 at the moment were offering farmers a price for winter lambs and they are taking that as the benchmark a base that means the spot price could be even better so we never actually induce any change
3939430 theyve been less than transparent with the information and signals back to the farmers to influence their behaviour
3939431 have some influence on when the farmer puts the ram out and on what ram he uses on what grasses perform best on animal welfare issues and a whole range of activities that create opportunities for us in the marketplace
3939432 we said no youre just going to cause more friction in the supply chain but lets talk about another way
3939433 we found they were very much part of the meat industry they handle more stock units than we do and were the largest processer while theyre not owned by farmers their customer base is farmers and they rely on their good fortunes we had a lot in common
3939434 their stock transactions have nothing to do with satisfying the markets needs
3939435 its about moving stock from a to b to get a commission
3939436 it was instead of you coming forward along the supply chain to us why dont we go back to you
3939437 so they take over our procurement function but if they balls that up it would create problems for our business how do we solve that create a partnership you invest in our business so it becomes circular and therefore its in your interest to make it work
3939438 then we looked at the stake twenty per cent would be almost a token gesture so we thought that to make it really absolutely collaborative and for them to be incentivised to share in the benefits a 50 50 partnership would be the utopia of accountabilities and of sharing the outcomes
3939439 when we sat back and looked at that it looked bloody marvellous
3939440 sales is about delivering product to an established customer base whereas marketing is creating demand which the sale people deliver against the meat industry hasnt been marketing focused in this sense
3939441 what the industry does is put the company logo on ppcs alliance affco cmp what does that mean nothing the consumer wants to know where it came from and how to cook it they want to have a connection with the brands and were all about that
3939442 we can see ourselves going to a breeder saying can you give us 2000 lambs at 30kg say and well pay a guaranteed price we may also say wed like you to use these genetics and if you do we will guarantee you this price
3939443 we will pay him to grow the grass at a price that is competitive with the dairy industry
3939444 the finishers dont want to take this risk at the moment they dont know what a 17 5kg lamb will be worth thats the trouble but they do know what the dairy industry will pay them for that grass so we say fine well give you the same money and well manage the stock its about competing for the land use as opposed to competing for 17 5kg lambs

3939448 our new fiscal year got off to a good start and our efforts to increase awareness and sales capacity in order to secure new customers are delivering results
3939449 despite economic uncertainty customers have continued to expand and evolve their storage infrastructure and are looking to netapp to help them reduce costs and enable new capabilities
3939450 if an independent software vendor discovers that they have shipped a vulnerable activex control they should e mail us to work with microsoft to issue a kill bit disabling that control
3939451 this is right in line with microsofts presentation at black hat
3939452 they said many times that they are working as a coalition to better secure the windows operating system and everything which runs on it
3939453 while microsoft has issued a few kill bits in the past for third party products this is something we are going to continue to see going forward
3939454 palmerston north to me is one of the most exciting places to be
3939455 this is a huge opportunity for new zealand to recognise the manawatu as probably the centre of that human nutrition food research and we want to consolidate that
3939456 its probably a merger that should have happened some time ago
3939457 to make the science go faster to expand what we do
3939458 i cant really even begin to speculate on that just at the moment

3939463 not at all remember poetry responses are due monday at 8 am
3939464 its usually not a lack of planning its the cost of living
3939465 hopefully some of them will be just one offs but things are worse this winter
3939466 its not just beneficiaries but people in jobs often with a number of children a lot of people are mentioning power costs and of course the price of petrol
3939467 the greatest thing weve seen is the families who have irregular or variable jobs that might be affected by the weather that sort of thing and suddenly their income is down
3939468 some will apply for a work and income grant but it wont come quickly enough
3939469 we are also seeing more men sometimes thats to do with having custody of the children maybe for the school holidays and there are costs that havent been sorted out if transports involved the grocery money goes on petrol
3939470 we encourage our foodbank families to come along but its really sad they are finding it too hard they cant afford the petrol and there are no buses in the evening

3939489 even though i play baseball im still a baseball fan and still watch what everybody else is doing and read the papers for cubs fans and sox fans its fun to be here
3939490 i think the fact that the cubs have played to expectations while the cardinals have been ravaged by injuries and the fact that the brewers are a very talented but inconsistent team prone to streaks has really put the cubs where they are right now
3939491 thats better than where everybody thought wed be 25 games below 500
3939492 i thought he could be a 30 home run guy

3939495 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
3939496 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
3939497 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
3939498 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
3939499 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
3939500 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
3939501 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
3939502 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
3939503 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems
3939504 today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts
3939505 we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law
3939506 in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate
3939507 i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security

3939514 bloody oath its scary this is supposed to be a peaceful neighbourhood

3939522 people in the heron islaes neighborhood where the two men lived say they were surprised to learn the two serial bank robbers connected to three bank robberies in nassau county and dozens of others in massachusettes were living right there on their street
3939523 they seemed like a normal family they were very nice people at least we thought
3939524 it was a weird occurrence of events to say the least t hey were using my fiance to help them move items and those items just happened to be cash lots of it
3939525 its been a hard two weeks for our offense and a hard two weeks for willy at the top of the order
3939526 ive moved around in the lineup a lot this season thats one thing ive tried not to do is change anything no matter where i am in the lineup
3939527 hopefully i can get on base and we can get some guys to score some runs early
3939528 obviously mixing it up a little bit is something we needed to do
3939529 things could have happened worse it could have hit better places it could have hit worse places i think i fared pretty well
3939530 it would have been nice if it would have hit a meatier spot
3939531 hes having such a big year wed hate to see any kind of setback with him we know what he means to us hes our best pitcher and we dont want to lose him
3939532 he sido muy afortunado dios me dio la oportunidad de tener un hijo un hermoso ni o que s lo ped a una cosa cari o para eso hab a venido al mundo para amar y ser amado
3939533 lo acog en mis brazos y crecimos juntos nos complementamos y ten a la necesidad de ofrecer ese cari o que l tanto requer a tuve la oportunidad de darle algo mejor una familia que viv a en armon a una mam una hermana y un hermano
3939534 imagine un minuto lo que ese padre y su familia pudieron sentir en aquel momento pero la esperanza nunca muere y ellos esperaron 50 d as que convertidos en horas podr an traducirse en meses minutos que se convert an en a os y segundos que eran una eternidad sorda qu poco valor puede tener el dinero si la vida de un ser humano est en juego
3939535 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
3939536 there is so much power in this car and we werent even going that fast you could feel every vibration its too bad i wont be able to watch the indycars at infineon next week well be on a road trip
3939537 ive followed danica patrick after meeting her and hope i can see a race in person when it comes out here next year i really enjoy indycar racing it is my favorite type of racing
3939538 its always neat to interact with athletes from other sports
3939539 we talked about baseball and motor sports and i think he had a great time i know he enjoyed the experience
3939540 its still an adrenaline rush like being on the mound but its a different kind of adrenaline rush it just came in a different form
3939541 i knew what the rumors were but yeah 50 50 i guess
3939542 were gonna give this kid a shot to see if he can help us ill give him a shot thursday hopefully he takes advantage and helps us win the game then well see what happens
3939543 because if carrasco starts thursday then we lose him for four or five days and especially with scott linebrink not here i think its important to have carrasco for the seventh and eighth before we get to bobby jenks
3939544 i gotta let him know this is not a game to see him pitch this is a game to win we gotta get the best out of him
3939545 whether its a pennant race or its not im still trying to get every hitter out that i face the pennant race is kind of for the fans and for us to think about after the game is over the more outside things that you let into the game the more things there are to distract you and im not smart enough to focus on more than one thing at once
3939546 we think dykstra will probably come down to the last day
3939547 this one had a couple of hurdles some curveballs that we werent expecting so thats why its taken a little more time
3939548 there may be some risks involved so were deciding how much risk we want to take on
3939549 weve got a monster here on our hands i hope
3939550 hes done this for a really long time and hes a welcome addition hes been here since the deadline and hes fit right in with the group weve got in the bullpen and hes throwing well
3939551 hes a veteran hes done it hes been through those situations over and over again and hes been successful in those situations that was an excellent pickup
3939552 and hes got stuff hes 38 and hes throwing 91 92 mph
3939553 it would not be right to talk about these things
3939554 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3939555 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3939556 los pueblos originarios no fueron incluidos en la discusi n de la lge
3939557 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
3939558 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
3939559 umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
3939560 al t pico estilo de las dictaduras que precedieron a la recuperaci n de la democracia en 1982
3939561 toman aeropuertos toman cortes departamentales electorales y balean carros coches de ministros
3939562 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano
3939563 los resultados del proceso cualquiera que estos fueran con la mayor cordura y sentido de responsabilidad
3939564 a ver el lugar de reposo de mat as catrileo el fue mi hermano mi amigo que me acompa en los d as de prisi n fui a rendirle homenaje
3939565 porque yo no ten a factura para comprobar que los 180 000 que se robaron eran m os
3939566 yo siento mucho sufrimiento estos a os que el hijo est preso son un dolor muy grande la comida no la puedo aprovechar la como entre l grimas a ra z de este problema de los que llevan la justicia me he enfermado tuvieron que llevarme al hospital espero que dejen en libertad a mi hijo y me lo entreguen en buenas condiciones como estaba l al ser detenido
3939567 un interlocutor v lido que en este caso ser a o el ministro de gobierno jorge tobares o alg n funcionario de alto rango con poder de decisi n
3939568 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
3939569 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
3939570 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
3939571 defenderemos hasta las ltimas consecuencias nuestras tierras y espacios sagrados
3939572 comenzando por el se or alcalde de puerto saavedra sr ricardo tripainao calfulaf por cuanto l fue quien autoriz y propici la construcci n de dicha carretera usando a las personas con enga o diciendo mejoramiento de camino pasando por encima de los estudios de impactos ambiental sociocultural llevado a cabo por la universidad de la frontera adem s el ministerio de obras p blicas y la intendencia estaban en conocimiento de los hechos y acontecimientos acaecidos en dicho territorio
3939573 no queremos que avance un metro mas la carretera porque fue un gran enga o del se or alcalde ricardo tripainao diciendo que era mejoramiento de camino esto no es mejoramiento de camino sino que derechamente una carretera
3939574 nosotros protegemos adoramos amamos e invocamos a la madre naturaleza y no permitiremos que sigan adelante con estos destrozos esto es un atropello del gobierno y esperamos que se presenten a darnos una explicaci n en el lugar afectado
3939575 lo que proponemos como alternativa es que la carretera pueda pasar por otra v a
3939576 nosotros no estamos en contra del camino porque es necesario pero queremos que se respeten los lugares sagrados
3939577 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
3939578 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
3939579 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
3939580 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
3939581 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
3939582 bueno mira vamos a alambrar esto porque ac vamos a tener los animales a medias
3939583 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
3939584 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
3939585 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
3939586 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
3939587 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3939588 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3939589 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3939590 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
3939591 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
3939592 church does not believe that the pope is the anti christ thats absolutely false im very grateful that my pastor has come out and been very clear on this matter and i think its patently absurd and its a false statement
3939593 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
3939594 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
3939595 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo
3939596 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
3939597 llevar tiempo y esfuerzo para recuperar la capacidad de los peque os agricultores y no parece que haya ning n deseo pol tico para esto sin olvidar el hecho que nafta debe ser renegociada
3939598 in til buscar un programa de recuperaci n que sea consistente con el pago de la deuda fijada por nuestros acreedores
3939599 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
3939600 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
3939601 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
3939602 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
3939603 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
3939604 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas

3939612 the sharper edge by his aides and the candidate is further evidence that the mccain campaign has changed replaced by splashier events reminiscent of a previous republican campaign for the white house

3939615 the high price of gas brought exxon mobil close to 22 billion in profit in profit for the first half of this year
3939616 i asked him how he justifies that amount that some see as obscene
3939617 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3939618 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3939619 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3939620 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3939621 we were all heart broken that we didnt get a chance to run but we feel like its really turned around and we had a chance to win
3939622 i just totally missed the shifter button in the first round of qualifying
3939623 the bike took off to the left which its never done usually im prepared for the bike to go right i was just holding on and you cant hold on and shift the motorcycle you have to go with the motorcycle and really ride the thing
3939624 after that i was just determined to ride that motorcycle like i knew i could and we went better and better
3939625 we had the best qualifying position weve had this year we went really fast and improved every round then we improved again first round on sunday and went a 6 95 set the track record and got low et of the meet
3939626 that was a beautiful pass and the bike went really straight
3939627 then we had to run the harley and andrew hines in the second round
3939628 he redlighted and angelle had a good light an 04 she got excited when she saw his redlight looked over and took a peek missed a shift and hit the rev limiter and slowed us down to a 7 05 but it wouldve gone a 6 90something again
3939629 in the next round chip ellis redlighted and angelle was able to go a 7 flat
3939630 all it does is tell the ecu engine control unit that the engines turning over it costs 31
3939631 we came back to the trailer and changed it and it started right up
3939632 i was upset but it was really a nice weekend
3939633 the weather was beautiful we had fun and the crew guys michael and curtis did great
3939634 we had a great weekend and we finally found the tune up in the bike
3939635 thanks to karl and kim klement and the rush racing products folks for giving us a chance to do this
3939636 and i want to give angelle a pat on the back for her driving this weekend and my boys did everything right the motorcycle was great the boys back at star racing and g2 did a good job putting the motors together
3939637 i can hold first gear longer than i have been but ive hit the rev limiter a few times and im scared of that i cant be scared of it
3939638 angelle was coiled and cocked and ready to rock and we didnt get a chance to show off what we could do in the finals
3939639 but we picked up 60 points on the guys who went out first round like eddie krawiec chris rivas and a couple of other guys we closed the gap on it was a good move for us the bike was fast and were ready for the next race at reading
3939640 we had some really good runs all weekend but i still havent won brainerd yet
3939641 its the only track i havent won on yet but reading is a great track for me i think there have been only two or three times ive raced at reading that i havent been in the final round so since we did this well at brainerd i feel i have a mental advantage going to reading that is my race
3939642 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3939643 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3939644 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3939645 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3939646 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3939647 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3939648 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3939649 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3939650 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3939651 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3939652 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3939653 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3939654 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3939655 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3939656 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3939657 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3939658 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3939659 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3939660 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3939661 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3939662 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3939663 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3939664 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3939665 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3939666 everything will be fine the son of a bitch is so drugged he cant tell which way is up or down
3939667 hes not like the others this one is worse the moment you let your guard down thats it youre dead
3939668 i appreciate your concern but ive dealt with people like this before so theres nothing to worry about
3939669 if anything goes wrong ill have him put down so fast he wont know what hit him
3939670 well have him ready to go within the next hour
3939671 we cant replicate the 100 percent brick and exposed beam industrial look that has become popular with the dot coms but we will have high ceilings lots of light and other features they value
3939672 theyre working through it and have been cutting down fencing
3939673 we saw some smoke from the new building that was under construction and then we saw flames coming out of the windows and then all of a sudden the whole thing went up before we could even call 911
3939674 i got a couple of residents here people who were evacuated
3939675 theyre in shock i believe honestly i think theyre all going to go up
3939676 it was really horrible i just hope everybody down there is ok
3939677 sitting on our front step crying she wont take water its horrible
3939678 people are coming for a drink of water just to get off the streets its depresseing
3939679 theyre up against the size of the fire and getting water resources together to get in front of the fire
3939680 i didnt think it was going to be this bad this is so heartbreaking
3939681 i was at work in the city got a call from a neighbor and hopped on the road and came home everyone was outside and the building was already gone by the time i got here
3939682 nothing man no clothes nothing just the clothes on my back
3939683 go and hang out at a restaurant theyre bussing everyone to a fire station
3939684 i dont really feel like being part of a giant group of people
3939685 weve been getting calls from neighbors and people driving by theres a dog trapped on the island
3939686 the geese are very wary of them then eventually they figure it out
3939687 theyre very striking when you first come upon them i could see how it would be for someone driving by at 70 miles per hour
3939688 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3939689 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3939690 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3939691 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3939692 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3939693 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3939694 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3939695 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3939696 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3939697 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3939698 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3939699 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3939700 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3939701 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3939702 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3939703 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way
3939704 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
3939705 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
3939706 without a doubt some press didnt see it that way
3939707 were surprised by the remarks of racism spain is not a racist country quite the opposite
3939708 we have great respect for the far east and its people some of my best friends in toronto are originally chinese including one of our sponsors the brand li ning
3939709 whoever wants to interpret it differently is completely confusing it
3939710 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3939711 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3939712 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3939713 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3939714 one should never put on ones best trousers to go out to battle for freedom and truth
3939715 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3939716 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3939717 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3939718 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3939719 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3939720 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3939721 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3939722 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3939723 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3939724 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3939725 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3939726 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3939727 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3939728 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3939729 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight

3939733 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3939734 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

3939737 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
3939738 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
3939739 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
3939740 lets be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that russia and the united states have engaged in on iran or north korea
3939741 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe
3939742 this is much bigger than any other place where there is american influence and this is the most natural allies of america
3939743 there will be no compromise at the expense of our territorial integrity
3939744 i never accused the united states in the first place of anything
3939745 i just said that the russians mistook some of the statements at certain levels
3939746 i dont think you can have any doubt but that the united states has from the very beginning believed that the south ossetian situation needed to be resolved and resolved peacefully as weve been working for months and months and months to do but that russia seriously overreached that russia engaged in activities that could not possibly be associated simply with the crisis in south ossetia
3939747 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3939748 if i were a neighbor of russia and i saw what russia had done in georgia i would be very nervous
3939749 i think those countries that are leaning toward the west are very nervous today
3939750 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3939751 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight
3939752 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3939753 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3939754 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3939755 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3939756 arkansas has lost a great son and i have lost a great friend there is deep pain in arkansas tonight because of the sheer number of people who knew respected and loved bill gwatney
3939757 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3939758 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well

3939763 what i wanted to talk about was how physical they were
3939764 i asked if i could come down and watch them he gave me his number and told me to come down anytime
3939765 out of shape their defense was struggling to get to the ball
3939766 i feel bad for the poor horse hes probably going to die soon anyway
3939767 as long as hes being taken care of they should leave him alone
3939768 it pains us to take this measure however we need to avoid placing undue burden on our company and our service even with a limit of 250 messages received per week it could cost twitter about 1 000 per user per year to send sms outside of canada india or the us it makes more sense for us to establish fair billing arrangements with mobile operators than it does to pass these high fees on to our users

3939776 overall the new iphone is performing just great on our 3g network
3939777 weve seen this in the past before in motorolas razr line it was a very big seller but the first version of that phone had rf radio frequency problems they had to recall it fix it and put it back out there
3939778 it could end up drawing more power because now the phone thinks its getting a worse signal than it actually is when it goes to talk to the network it speaks louder than it needs to
3939779 naturally while seated at a console in front of a high resolution three dimensional visual display
3939780 the iphone has changed the way people think about their mobile phones and we are delighted to help more customers get their hands on this revolutionary product
3939781 our best buy mobile employees have the training and expertise to deliver the best experience possible for our customers from the initial purchase through the life of their iphones
3939782 suprisingly ive never watched it on t v or ever anything before because at that time of my life i was more concerned with going shopping or anything a fifteen year old is more involved with
3939783 i did a report on john mccain in high school and i was really impressed with his credentials and background and everything
3939784 everybody had their fred thompson petitions getting them signed to be a delegate on the ballot and i sheepishly would slip it under and would say would you sign this for my daughter oh who is she a delegate for well mccain but you know this is just an experience and id almost apologize
3939785 i called my mom and i was like i told you so because she never thought that i would get to go
3939786 and i see this taking her to places she would never get to go especially at her age
3939787 i dont think its hit me yet until i go up there i dont think its hit me
3939788 its a huge situation for me after 35 years because ive wanted to bring one back
3939789 this whole thing unfolded about two weeks ago when these two boys came on a talk show here in the states and announced theyd found a bigfoot body
3939790 the commentator asked them if they could send someone to see the body and they said the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body is the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
3939791 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there
3939792 i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being

3939817 its going to be a part of the job description unfortunately because he does a lot of blocking he has a stinger that were keeping an eye on to make sure everything is ok his head was ok we were concerned that he had a mild concussion but that wasnt the case
3939818 its a great example of why you have to practice he dropped two balls in critical situations and couldnt finish the long run a lot of that has to do with that he hasnt been out here

3939834 i cannot imagine why he would say it its not true ive worked tirelessly since 9 11 to prevent another attack on the united states of america my record is very clear
3939835 i cannot imagine it and so if he said that and i dont know the context i strenuously disagree
3939836 the fact that john mccains top adviser says that a terrorist attack on american soil would be a big advantage for their political campaign is a complete disgrace and is exactly the kind of politics that needs to change barack obama will turn the page on these failed policies and this cynical and divisive brand of politics so that we can unite this nation around a common purpose to finish the fight against al qaida
3939837 i deeply regret the comments they were inappropriate i recognize that john mccain has devoted his entire adult life to protecting his country and placing its security before every other consideration
3939838 threat and the iraqi connection to terrorism appear just a little more certain a little less questionable than they were
3939839 theres no accountability how do you manage or supervise in an environment where theres no accountability
3939840 its well known that fulton county is quick to hire rarely disciplines and perpetuates an inefficient government
3939841 probably the best description of fulton county a bloated jobs program every day fulton government wakes up and attempts to go to work it is evident that we need to restructure
3939842 its a long and tortuous process does it affect overall management certainly it does
3939843 it was an assumption on everyones part that because it was referenced on its web site that it was a fact

3939851 the docks are deep but those who dive in have no idea what may be lurking beneath the surface they have little concept of just how cold the water can be and once they are in they are surrounded by high sheer walls with limited means of escape
3939852 none of my officers want to have to deal with a death in circumstances that could have been avoided
3939853 we strongly discourage any young people from playing or swimming in the docks it is all too easy to get into difficulties because of the water temperature underwater hazards and undercurrents

3939862 russian tanks continue to ravage georgia town and villages killing people destroying buildings looting theyve been doing worse things to what ive heard in the past and i could never imagine happening in my country
3939863 we as the russian federation are sticking to the agreement which has been made in moscow yesterday and we hope that the other side will show its readiness to do the same
3939864 blaming again us for doing something which is contrary to the real situation
3939865 this is the kind of cease fire that i dont know they had with afghanistan i guess in 1979
3939866 there is no cease fire russian forces are moving around
3939867 not only those people who are committing all those atrocities are responsible but those who dont react to that i think they also share responsibility
3939868 those people in unincorporated parts of dallas county pay taxes and they deserve to have a deputy patrol their neighborhoods
3939869 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3939870 i have heard the russian president say that his military operations are over i am saying it is time for the russian president to be true to his word
3939871 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3939872 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3939873 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3939874 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3939875 we have no need nor do we intend to take over any georgian air or seaport to deliver humanitarian aid for those caught in this conflict it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3939876 ive also been having conversations with senators obama and mccain

3939879 mo is a player that excels as a traditional point guard but also brings an extra dimension with his scoring and versatility his ability to push the tempo get inside the lane shoot from the perimeter and distribute the ball will be very valuable for us
3939880 to establish diplomatic relations on the level of embassies in accordance with the united nations charter and international laws
3939881 we have long stood for the normalization of relations between syria and lebanon on the basis of equality and respect for lebanese sovereignty one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
3939882 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step

3939891 a lie has only one chance of successful deception to be accounted true
3939892 he refused to sign the release and until those documents are released i must believe his critics have reason to believe that he was not being candid to the american people
3939893 releasing his military reocrds is a easy thing for him to do but he refuses to do it
3939894 we need to explore what we can do to help out

3939898 over the years when i was clerk of courts it was my job to audit the jail billings and make sure the sheriff was properly billing us for ordinance cases rather than state statute cases

3939909 governor doyle is a stalwart and courageous supporter of stem cell research and proponent of wisconsins strategic goal to invest 750 million in biotechnology and stem cell research
3939910 outspoken and eloquent governor doyle is a leading spokesperson for the advancement of potentially lifesaving discovery
3939911 continues to be a significant leader in the world effort
3939912 stem cell research and biotechnology hold tremendous promise to grow wisconsins economy and advance critical medical technology that is the next frontier of hope for patients
3939913 if the economy remains robust on long island this population will continue to expand
3939914 what it says is there are going to be more people who belong to minority groups looking for housing on long island and basically thats going to create pressure to desegregate predominantly white areas can ethnic minority groups translate their greater numbers into greater political and legal power to challenge systemic discrimination in housing
3939915 i still say thats the best thing that happened to me
3939916 i got to go home and spend time with my father who was fighting unfortunately a losing battle with cancer
3939917 i still remember myself as a five foot tall kid in high school with a back brace on
3939918 i had a bunch of girl friends but no actual girlfriends
3939919 on the court makes a difference in my life but when i can use that to help others it makes my job seem much more meaningful
3939920 wheres my audience how traditional media can use social media to maintain relevance
3939921 it is very concerning to the sheriffs and all those responsible to public safety
3939922 the reason for concern is the accuracy and lack of information passed on about this crash not only to emergency responders but also to the public
3939923 we told them as far as we knew there was no one else on the helicopter
3939924 that information is still unclear at this point in time
3939925 its not uncommon in emergency situations that a number of different versions will come out before we get it settled down and figuring out ok what really did go on here
3939926 that is an excellent question i honestly dont know why
3939927 i think that was a delay in information the information sharing you know for whatever reason
3939928 and theres always so many stories about how fighters became champions
3939929 we are real honest to goodness practicing catholics who embrace and call attention to catholic social teaching
3939930 take the difficult political step but necessary moral step of repudiating her past actions in support of legalized abortion
3939931 a stellar 25 year pro life voting record in the congress
3939932 as a catholic journalist i think that catholics and all people deserve an explanation for certain claims that are made by the mccain campaign
3939933 so why does the catholic outreach pamphlet say that john mccain has a stellar pro life voting record in congress
3939934 reprogrammed adult cells display this embryonic characteristic they form fatal tumors in adults
3939935 even when they overcome the problems of using fetal tissue to make ips cells the cells still wont help anyone only adult stem cells are helping people now and only adult stem cells will help people in the future its all about the patients
3939936 while embryonic stem cell research advocates argue that we should make use of extra embryos the bitter bitter irony is that human embryonic stem cells cannot be used at all because they form tumors and lack essential properties needed to maintain mature tissues thus it is a waste of taxpayer dollars to fund human escr
3939937 human embryonic stem cell research is equivalent to abortion because in both cases innocent human beings are killed
3939938 it is inconsistent for john mccain to claim to be pro life and not protect human embryos from experimentation and death claims that mccain is orthodox pro life in opposing abortion but that embryonic research is relatively new and thus need not be seriously addressed are unacceptable
3939939 congress is poised to override the bush standard and push for federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research that involves the deaths of countless human beings in addition to those who are already dying in private research
3939940 discomfort with the notion of extracting stem cells from embryos is understandable but we hope congress will override the presidents veto of the stem cell research enhancement act
3939941 americans should protect innocent human beings at every stage of development and ability and we need a president who realizes this
3939942 i know theres disagreement we had several callers who were concerned about mccains support for embryonic stem cell research im against it im not panicking on the subject because i think john is warm and wonderful and humble and open and right down the line on the rights of the vulnerable i think well get there
3939943 a man of compassion who fights for human rights worldwide
3939944 a pro life reagan conservative ready to lead america as president on day one
3939945 a kind and supportive husband has fun works hard at his craft gives back funny in a jackass kind of way gets it
3939946 on aug 23 christopher israel will spend his last day as executive chef at 23hoyt which hit its peak this year and saucebox where he has increasingly played a minor role
3939947 at this point if i work at a restaurant i want it to be my own place
3939948 im trying to decide my next move my own place or a different realm of consulting or design
3939949 el chico le grit me has rayado el coche y alejandro le contest que no era verdad entonces empez a pegarle lo derrib de un pu etazo y una vez en el suelo le machac la cabeza a golpes
3939950 se argumenta se discute se saca un seguro del coche y ah se queda todo no es normal masacrarle el cr neo contra una escalera dejar el cad ver derramando sangre y darse a la fuga eso ya lo dice todo
3939951 i think what it will do is permit both myself and the attorney representing the petitioner to clarify our arguments and answers to the court
3939952 ultimately there is no doubt that whoever loses this is going to take this up to the 5th district court of appeals its nice to have a transcript and to be able to hear why the court ruled the way it did
3939953 they cant say that things are going to be different and say that is a benefit they have to show that the new thing they are going to be doing is somehow better than what they are doing right now they simply did not do that they mansons are saying we are going to be part of the city because they have a police department a fire department and they have water service the township already services that area they have to somehow show that the citys services are better in my opinion there has not been any evidence of any benefit
3939954 this is a 10 acre parcel that is almost completely surrounded by the city
3939955 the mansons are building one house they already started construction how can that be a detriment its not going to increase traffic its not a strain on anybodys services and the maintenance on the road where that property is located is going to be irrelevant
3939956 the mansons have a property and they should be able to have that property located where they want it to be despite what trustee celeste dehoff says tuscarawas township doesnt have a police department and doesnt have a fire department the sheriffs department cant possibly cover this side of the county as well as the city its a no brainer with this property
3939957 senseless act of depraved violence that touches all of us
3939958 ha hablado cuando ha querido y se ha callado en los temas sobre los que no le ha interesado hablar

3939962 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
3939963 i see no reason why the court shouldnt act in accordance with the wishes of the parties
3939964 as to choosing the united states has made very clear that it is standing by the democratically elected government of georgia
3939965 and we are aware that the u s is uptight about this project
3939966 but a choice will have to be made someday between considerations of prestige related to an illusory project and a real partnership in matters which indeed require collective efforts
3939967 lets be very clear whose interests are being served by the partnership that russia and the united states have engaged in on iran or north korea
3939968 america is losing the whole region and this is the region of eastern and central europe
3939969 this is much bigger than any other place where there is american influence and this is the most natural allies of america
3939970 life it aint 2 funky unless its got that pop
3939971 typically we see copycats shortly after a major campaign but this was sent by the same people
3939972 but remember it took about three days for the cnn spam to peak
3939973 do not download flash player from a site other than adobe com
3939974 online review sites are much more interactive than old publishing
3939975 restaurant owners for example can add comments to a particular negative review they can comment on what has been said and how they will any address problems in the future
3939976 wala ngayon wala pang hinihirang ang pangulo hinihintay natin ang announcement i cannot name names the president has not made any announcement were waiting for that announcement
3939977 ito prerogative ng pangulo siya lang ang makakapagsabi kung sino ang nararapat na maging susunod na chief pnp this is the prerogative of the president who is the only one who can say who the next pnp chief will be
3939978 ating pinoproseso ang summary dismissal proceedings sa kanila nag file tayo ng administrative charges we are now processing summary dismissal proceedings against them we have filed administrative charges
3939979 di yan dapat gawin ng pulis na nag aalaga ng sanctity ng ballot at katahimikan during elections still that is not a reason to violate the sanctity of the ballot and betray their duty to ensure clean elections
3939980 i dont think you can stop people from getting interested
3939981 the us are interested that there will be peace in mindanao huwag natin bigyan ng injection ng swero kung walang kailangan noon the americans are interested that there will be peace in mindanao lets not inject motives where there are none
3939982 there were no genuine consultations with key stakeholders the text of the moa itself has not been released to public and policymaker scrutiny
3939983 in the hierarchy of lame excuses this has to rank high up there with gmas 2005 i am sorry for sheer feebleness
3939984 seemingly acknowledges this and makes constant reference to signing a comprehensive compact and changing the legal framework as necessary steps to give life to the bje
3939985 if this is the case why have our leaders acted in such a secretive hasty and dismissive manner
3939986 uphold the rule of law and abide by the democratic requirements of absolute transparency and full consultation
3939987 its very difficult to protect against these types of robberies because diamond merchants are very soft targets and diamonds are as good as cash
3939988 when there are more of these types of robberies it makes it increasingly prohibitive for them to do business because insurance rates become too high
3939989 the internet has become a good venue to sell stolen diamonds because theyre not just going to sell them to a lab to get them certified because theyll know that well discover theyre stolen
3939990 typically we see copycats shortly after a major campaign but this was sent by the same people
