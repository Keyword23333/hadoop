3520000 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3520001 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3520002 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3520003 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3520004 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3520005 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3520006 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3520007 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3520008 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3520009 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3520010 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3520011 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3520012 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3520013 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3520014 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3520015 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
3520016 it is all just mist does anybody think that china would ever consider cooking the books on aug 10 ap measured 604 micrograms m 3 the bbc measured 278 in another location and beijings air quality index which is supposed to be the highest of many different readings measured 82
3520017 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3520018 our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity later in this century and in the next on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century
3520019 once they are gone youll go back to sucking down the equivalent of a cigarette drag every time you breathe outdoors
3520020 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3520021 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3520022 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3520023 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3520024 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3520025 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3520026 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3520027 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3520028 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3520029 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3520030 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3520031 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3520032 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3520033 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3520034 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3520035 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3520036 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3520037 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3520038 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3520039 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3520040 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3520041 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3520042 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3520043 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3520044 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3520045 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3520046 its not that things are looking better for the us its things are just looking bad elsewhere
3520047 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3520048 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3520049 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3520050 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3520051 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3520052 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3520053 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3520054 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3520055 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3520056 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3520057 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3520058 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3520059 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3520060 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3520061 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3520062 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3520063 sent a personal message asking her to get on board he has always admired her music and thinks she is the perfect choice because of her unique appeal to black and white voters
3520064 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3520065 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3520066 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
3520067 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
3520068 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
3520069 ma hantise mourir brutalement dans un attentat ou un crime crapuleux et de savoir que sarko et dautres ministres viendront baver sur mon cercueil
3520070 i hope the british board of film classification bbfc will view this with concern and decide it should not be granted a classification
3520071 what the rest of world does is up to them we need to ensure that modern and civilised values take priority rather than killing and maiming people
3520072 it seems a shame that the games manufacturer have decided to exclusively release this game on the wii
3520073 i believe it will spoil the family fun image of the wii
3520074 mad world will be suitably age rated through the appropriate legal channels and thus only available to an audience above the age rating it is given
3520075 aware of this matter and necessary measures have been taken
3520076 the stylized nature of the film is what drew me because its far less a monster movie than a western in the mold of sergio leones o

3520081 ive seen the pictures of the baby she looks like john edwards shes got his eyes and jaw line and lips but she does have rielles nose
3520082 my niece is not a bastard i just dont think its right
3520083 she would not have a child with someone that she didnt love and she loves him
3520084 restricts accountability and oversight opens the door to corruption and abuse and in some instances may significantly increase the cost to american taxpayers
3520085 there is accountability through the contract and to the contracting officer
3520086 by seizing tskhinvali georgian president saakashkvili took one hell of a gamble that russia wouldnt intervene georgia is paying a high price for this
3520087 however with russian troops never far away it was always going to be david versus goliath but this time a slingshot was not good enough he had mr putin to deal with and there was never any doubt who would win that battle
3520088 men are always wicked at bottom unless they are made good by some compulsion
3520089 minnesotans have long known that norm coleman isnt working for them in washington
3520090 were just now beginning to understand who he is working for and what hes getting in return
3520091 this is a legitimate question to be asking in light of the fact that he is apparently renting from someone with an interest in his official actions as a senator
3520092 it would be one thing if he was paying above market value and they could argue that it is included in his rent but he is paying below market for this apartment at a minimum not paying utilities would be a violation of the congressional gift ban certainly under no way is it okay for a member of congress to be taking free or subsidized rent or benefits from anyone particularly from someone you are working with
3520093 i am not trying to peddle influence or get more business out of him curry favor with him
3520094 wheres the benefit for me what do i get out of this
3520095 this cozy relationship between a united states senator and one of the most high powered well connected operatives in washington raises serious questions
3520096 not only about norm colemans ethics but about his independence as an elected official and a legislator
3520097 surely the parents werent that oblivious their babys hair was looking kind of annoying
3520098 worse it reminded me of this movie i saw in the 90s about a group of sects i mean sects dagnammit how do you say sects as in a group of people who dress in weird attire and have exceptionally bizarre hairstyles very similar to princess leia but less conceptual
3520099 the sect is less conceptual or are you talking about their hair
3520100 the hair long and stringy and shaped oddly like a one year old who badly needs a haircut but the mother isnt at the point where she can let go and admit her child just may look better without looking like it belongs in a 1990s sect will you follow me here

3520115 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3520116 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3520117 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3520118 i think i play one of my best matches in the last weeks on hard court
3520119 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3520120 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3520121 and hopefully some of us will hear the national anthem at the end of the week
3520122 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3520123 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3520124 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3520125 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3520126 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3520127 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3520128 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3520129 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3520130 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3520131 if youre not involved in the sport im not sure you can fully appreciate it
3520132 he is way past anything you have seen he is incredible
3520133 i dont think michael will let his guard down until the last relay race
3520134 i dont think he has a comfort zone at all until the whole meet is over the whole olympic games he will not let his guard down because theres always someone out there
3520135 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps
3520136 theyve been resting all week and just gearing themselves up for one race where every time michael gets up on the block he has to gear himself up for his performance that night or that morning

3520150 i have reached a decision to halt the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the aggressor has been punished and has incurred very significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3520151 georgia reports attacks continue as russias medvedev orders troop withdrawal
3520152 russian president dmitry medvedev has called an end to the military operation in georgia but has stressed that in the event of georgian attack russian troops will hit back
3520153 our troops are making advances we are hoping for success
3520154 on friday georgian troops began a military action against south ossetias forces in an attempt to re establish control over the region
3520155 the evidence to proof the usas hand behind the georgian aggression against south ossetia can be found in western media western news agencies reuters for example have been distributing countless photographs depicting russias supposed atrocities in georgia such photos along with adequate headlines can be found in practically all us newspapers the new york times is the best example for it all of them unanimously accuse russia of aggression against georgia but they do not say a word about georgias actions against civilians in s ossetia

3520166 he comes to make his blessings flow far as the curse is found
3520167 the gospel will continue to grow and flourish throughout the world more and more individuals will be converted the nations will stream to christ and the great commission will finally be successfully completed the earth will be as full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea when that happens generation after generation will love and serve the lord faithfully and then the end will come
3520168 how wonderful it would all be if all this could be true the best part of the story is it is
3520169 the victory of this kingdom is still watered by the blood of the martyrs figuratively and literally the way of the cross is still the only way to enduring glory
3520170 if god grants a genuine reformation it will be one like that which was granted in the sixteenth century and the most obvious common feature it will share with that earlier reformation will be that it
3520171 more pastors ought to wonder about this shouldnt ministers and churches be more concerned than they are about the lack of opposition they are facing and shouldnt they be willing to consider if it isnt the result of diluting the message it is possible to talk about the final judgment and the lordship of jesus christ in such a way that makes it clear that he is only lord over those areas that secularists are frankly happy to let him have the afterlife for example who cares if jesus is lord in ways that never make any difference at all
3520172 this must not be taken to mean that every last human being who ever lived will finally be saved our lords teaching on the terrible nature of everlasting fire excludes that option so the fact that christ will save the world does not mean that he will save every last individual who ever lived in it every bible believer must reject the universalism that denies the awful reality of the final judgment for unbelievers
3520173 as soon as possible as far as we are concerned
3520174 so with the prime minister saying its time for you to go
3520175 i think its time for our country to sit down with the iraqis and work that plan out we need to be respectful of what the prime minister says and respectful of the will of the american people who have been against this war for a long time we should have a high level meeting with the iraqis to work out the terms of our deployment out of iraq so the end could be in sight

3520226 major work including removing walls subdividing and consolidating apartments generally requires council consent to ensure correct safety amenity and construction processes are followed
3520227 works undertaken without first gaining council consent can be subject to fines and orders requiring the works to be rectified and can require development applications be lodged to seek consent for ongoing uses
3520228 pier 6 7 is in the walsh bay wharves precinct conservation area which is listed on the state heritage register this means that development consent for most works is also required from the heritage office
3520229 i dont have all the details but yes we have all the approvals
3520230 works have been going on for more than a year and i have had to live underneath it the whole time
3520231 bruce has been encouraging people to sell their apartments so they can be amalgamated with other apartments
3520232 wed been told there would be more amalgamations and that wed just have to cop it
3520233 all i wanted to do was find a way we could have some peace between renovations then i suppose i started asking the wrong questions
3520234 neither i nor anyone else at dynamic wishes to remove the chair of pier 6 7 we have no reason to want to do so and my actions are totally motivated by compliance with the law and the best interests of the scheme
3520235 even if the same person owns apartments on both sides of a common property wall that wall is still common property
3520236 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
3520237 un canvi dactitud de mentalitat i dobertura del govern de lestat en el que fa refer ncia al finan ament i als traspassos

3520240 i mean it was only a couple of seconds im not sure it really was sex at least until this happened
3520241 the facilitator president mbeki will be carrying out a press conference to outline the state of the negotiations
3520242 we as a party will be carrying out a press conference tomorrow
3520243 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3520244 we are proceeding and the president mugabe is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition
3520245 the talks have not collapsed its just a time out break
3520246 we can turn a cloudy day into a dry and sunny one by shooting the clouds less intensively than when we make rain
3520247 we made a short film and we realized that short films are totally lame
3520248 his features are a little too curious george the product shots that snack looked up online were mad suspect in the skin lightening department too had a brother looking like nat king cole on television in the 50s and shit im not feeling the fact that his campaign probably isnt seeing any of this money either they say that 1 goes to his campaign for every figure sold online why does he have the ill arsenio finger i bet these toy making motherfuckers are a bunch of white boys trying to cash in on one of the most amazing moments in the history of the united states
3520249 two one for my desk and one for the crib
3520250 but because of the overwhelming size of the collection and the complex and time consuming nature of provenance investigations we decided the best and most expeditious course of action was to publicize the art work to the general public
3520251 i need them both henry has played very well throughout pre season i know that there is an opinion against him but i am his coach and i know how he is beyond the games
3520252 if they are spending more its in adjusted for inflation dollars this is about some right wing troglodytes in the party overcome with self righteous indignation that people like toronto broadcast journalist avi lewis received funding
3520253 would we not love to get that from our stock portfolios if these cuts will save the countrys economy god help us were in worse shape than i ever thought
3520254 not exactly the foot that most canadians would want to see put forward
3520255 i guess more than anything its a little bit annoying that weve been made the scapegoat when you consider how much money we receive relative to the budget for the entire program
3520256 i think our funding comes in at something less than 0 1 per cent of the whole program
3520257 so all of these other larger groups who need money more than we do to travel abroad like ballet and symphonies we become the scapegoat for the cutting in their funding
3520258 she turned and went toward todd and thats when she was attacked
3520259 to me that was a strong indication of her love she also is a fabulous woman
3520260 both men were shouting very loudly at each other they were speaking in english
3520261 then the chinese guy lifted a knife and slashed wildly at these people he went berserk and was screaming all the time
3520262 they were very excited about making this trip to china
3520263 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
3520264 we love him not only because he is so handsome but because he represents the pride of china
3520265 take your hands away from my dearest brother you cop
3520266 they praised him for his 360 degree handsome look well built body in perfect proportion refined and exemplary postures smile and courtesy to torch bearers his pals and audience and determination to safeguard the olympic spirit
3520267 in torch relay pictures he stayed calm and confident during violent situations and gracious graceful and proud in most others those other stars or idols lacking an unpolluted and vigorous temperament are not attractive any longer
3520268 my dear second brother on the right please marry me
3520269 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3520270 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3520271 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3520272 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3520273 a number of girls were on the short list for the show and lin was the best actress while yang had the best voice
3520274 so at the end of the day they decided to have both
3520275 however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded foots may have been used
3520276 i do not think the chinese state realises how unethical this is they dont understand what kind of values they are reflecting
3520277 does highlight a trend with other studies linking shortages of vitamin d to increased rates of breast cancer and depression in the elderly
3520278 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough

3520287 so i tell you dont worry about everyday life whether you have enough food drink and clothes doesnt life consist of more than food and clothing
3520288 and why worry about your clothes look at the lilies and how they grow they dont work or make their clothing
3520289 so dont worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will bring its own worries todays trouble is enough for today
3520290 keep on asking and you will be given what you ask for keep on looking and you will find keep on knocking and the door will be opened
3520291 the prime minister of new zealand angrily denounced israel and imposed diplomatic sanctions on it after two suspected mossad agents were jailed for six months for trying on false grounds to obtain a new zealand passport the plot which involved obtaining a passport in the name of a tetraplegic man who had not spoken in years provoked a furious reaction yesterday

3520309 de radiomakers kunnen via angrylog audio en video aan hun log toevoegen we zijn continu bezig met het ontwikkelen van nieuwe idee n
3520310 el parque vive un momento crucial para su existencia la mayor a de las poblaciones animales a excepci n del rinoceronte blanco del que no se puede asegurar su supervivencia pueden salvarse todav a s lo depende del grado de protecci n que tengan a partir de ahora
3520311 algunas como la jirafa del congo tambi n amenazada de extinci n
3520312 si los rinocerontes aparecen una soluci n ser a cruzarlos con los que hay en dos zool gicos en la rep blica checa y san diego ee uu o con rinocerontes blancos surafricanos creo que es mejor tener un rinoceronte h brido que nada si no aparecen tenemos material gen tico suyo conservado en sur frica y quiz podr an clonarse como pretende la universidad de edimburgo como ltima soluci n no lo veo mal aunque si me dan a elegir entre gastar un mont n de dinero en protegerlos o clonarlos yo opto por la protecci n me parece un poco triste que los ni os acaben conociendo a los animales en los parques tem ticos o cibern ticos
3520313 lo primero es salvar el parque y darlo a conocer que la gente vuelva a o r hablar de garamba
3520314 me parece algo normal a todo te acostumbras claro que con los hipop tamos hay que tener cuidado porque cuando salen a pastar por la noche son peligrosos cargan cuando menos te lo esperas
3520315 la capacidad de volar en un espacio de libertad tan grande como ste es imposible en europa
3520316 no creo que encontremos ejemplares si acaso uno o dos
3520317 aunque encontremos los cinco ser an insuficientes para recuperar la especie creo que el rinoceronte blanco del norte de frica est muerto
3520318 se debi actuar hace cinco a os cuando todav a quedaban 35 rinocerontes y era posible hacer algo
3520319 aunque hay que ser realistas por lo menos habr a que cruzar 10 para tener xito
3520320 aunque entonces no tuvo xito creo que es una buena idea
3520321 desde hace 50 a os han perdido mucho h bitat en toda frica primero fueron las guerras luego los safaris los pu os de las dagas de los millonarios yemen es y ahora los f rmacos chinos en estos momentos hay en china mucho dinero y muchos chinos en frica que son un peligro para los elefantes y rinocerontes
3520322 ahora mismo si no disminuye su n mero vamos bien el paso siguiente es tenerlas muy controladas lo bueno es que el h bitat del parque no est desapareciendo porque est protegido si logramos erradicar a los furtivos la jirafa se recuperar lo importante es que se sepa su situaci n
3520323 me gustan m s los rinocerontes negros son muy combativos
3520324 intent subirme a un rbol pero me embisti con el cuerno
3520325 hay que tener instinto de rastreador a veces cuando sigues una huella y el animal est cerca lo sientes
3520326 en general caminan en l nea recta pero llega un momento en que empiezan a hacer eses y a moverse sin sentido porque buscan comida entonces es cuando hay que tener m s cuidado pueden estar muy cerca de ti
3520327 con o sin rinocerontes ste es un parque magn fico un espacio salvaje de una belleza incre ble dif cil de encontrar ya en frica y con una fauna y flora variad simas tiene agua todo el a o lo cruzan dos r os el garamba y el dungu afluentes y zonas pantanosas
3520328 y una poblaci n de chimpanc s bastante desconocida y a la que deber a de prestarse m s protecci n
3520329 desde guilas marciales y volatineras hasta el ibis sagrado pasando por los coloristas abejarucos escarlata o de garganta roja y el enorme gran c lao
3520330 algunos parques africanos apenas tienen animales pero eso no impide que la gente quiera visitarlos porque son enormes reas de naturaleza intocadas garamba adem s de los rinocerontes blancos hipop tamos elefantes y leones tiene muchas especies a conservar y es bueno que haya fondos para hacerlo incluso si se pierden los rinos porque su naturaleza es de una gran belleza
3520331 porque frica no va a cambiar en bastantes a os
3520332 en el congo todos los parques funcionan con ayuda internacional no hay fondos del estado
3520333 es mucho m s natural y ecol gico pasear en elefantes que en todoterreno puedes atravesar los r os y los hipop tamos no se molestan ya se hace en otros parques africanos y nadie se rasga las vestiduras
3520334 el tener una buena red de pistas resulta fundamental para la seguridad el turismo y los estudios que queremos hacer
3520335 de vez en cuando todav a hay furtivos que matan alg n ant lope o b falo pero en general el furtivismo ha descendido bastante el verdadero problema es la guerrilla la lra ugandesa que cuando se topa con los guardas tira a matar
3520336 ha sido lo m s duro lo peor de mi trabajo en frica
3520337 el problema principal de estos pa ses es que a veces piensan que la cooperaci n internacional se tiene que encargar de todo pretenden que te conviertas en estado que hagas de polic a de m dico de maestro de obras p blicas
3520338 para intentar cambiar la mentalidad de mi pa s siempre eran los hombres los que hac an este trabajo y quise tener la valent a de dar ejemplo a otras mujeres
3520339 al contrario est n contentos nuestro salario es igual que el de los hombres y nos consideran como a ellos no me importar a quedarme as 30 a os
3520340 estuve tres a os de centinela de patrulla pero cuando hubo problemas con los rebeldes decidieron que me quedara a cargo de la armer a
3520341 si hay furtivos no dudar en utilizar las armas me gusta el parque y quiero defenderlo
3520342 ahora las mujeres son m s fuertes y din micas que los hombres pueden hacer patrulla lo mismo que nosotros sin perturbar al grupo ni ser un problema para la familia
3520343 si en europa hay mujeres militares por qu no en el congo
3520344 conozco bien el medio y me gusta es dif cil vivir aqu sin buenas escuelas comercios o tel fono pero es importante tener una estructura capaz de hacer una medicina b sica porque estamos en una provincia subdesarrollada no hay cerca hospitales y las carreteras son malas
3520345 en la campa a de recuento de 2006 hab amos trabajado 15 d as sin ver ni un rinoceronte y el ltimo d a en la ltima hora cuando ya no esper bamos nada sali uno
3520346 tenemos un margen hasta diciembre cuando pasen las lluvias seguiremos rastreando por tierra y aire con la avioneta y el ultraligero y si para entonces no aparece alg n rinoceronte los daremos por extinguidos no podemos pasarnos la vida persiguiendo algo que quiz ya no existe
3520347 podr a ser mucho peor si consideramos que m s de la mitad de las especies de cet ceos se hallan en la categor a de datos insuficientes lo que implica que se necesita prioritariamente investigaci n futura al respeto
3520348 cuando se desconecta el electrodo se regeneran los iones de cobalto
3520349 what really matters is companionship that is moving and touching and is inside of you
3520350 when people say how is it you want to hold up the scorecard 10 its great
3520351 none of this was taken lightly it was years in the making gary and i went to all kinds tons of marriage counseling
3520352 im an old fashioned guy who believes marriage should last until one of you quits breathing
3520353 by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage so then if she marries another man while her husband is still alive she is called an adulteress
3520354 his feeling was that this is our commitment and being true to this standard and keeping this vow is the most important thing for us for our children for our spiritual wellness
3520355 god didnt create this institution of marriage so he could just plug people into it he provided this so that people could enjoy each other to the fullest
3520356 if you have two people that are not thriving healthily in a situation i say remove the marriage let them heal
3520357 most of the unhappy spouses who avoided divorce did not stay trapped in misery
3520358 two thirds of unhappy spouses who stayed married ended up happily married five years down the road
3520359 if you have two people that are not thriving healthily in a situation i say remove the marriage let them heal
3520360 it is time to move beyond thinking about the divorce rate as an indicator of a social disorder that must be reduced
3520361 normal social events in the life course of modern families
3520362 what i find in life is that its not so much about good and bad people but about good and bad combinations
3520363 on one level i think anyone who has been through a divorce in your worst moments what you feel like you deserve is the big rubber stamp failure upon your forehead every morning when you wake up
3520364 it is better not to make a vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it do not protest my vow was a mistake therefore stand in awe of god
3520365 for better or for worse till death do us part
3520366 i promise to stay with you as long as you make me happy and we feel like friends and as long as we dont have problems too serious for counseling to cure
3520367 anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her and if she divorces her husband and marries another man she commits adultery
3520368 a wife must not separate from her husband but if she does she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband
3520369 i didnt get a divorce because i had a great marriage and then along came vince gill gary and i had a rocky road from day one i think what was so hard and this is what one of our counselors said sometimes an innocent party can come into a situation and theyre like a big spotlight what they do is reveal by comparison the painful dynamics that are already in existence through all of that process in my life vince was a friend of mine
3520370 the face of an angel pretty eyes that shine i lie awake at night wishing you were mine
3520371 anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her
3520372 well i didnt want the divorce but now that its come to that im at least free to find a new man
3520373 let him do so a believing man or woman is not bound is such circumstances
3520374 okay even if it would be adultery for me to divorce and remarry ill go ahead and do it anyway and then count on god to forgive me later
3520375 i have to have the loudest bass in the world coming out of my trunk
3520376 i have to have the loudest bass in the world coming out of my trunk
3520377 i have to have the loudest bass in the world coming out of my trunk
3520378 i have to have the loudest bass in the world coming out of my trunk
3520379 i have to have the loudest bass in the world coming out of my trunk
3520380 i have to have the loudest bass in the world coming out of my trunk
3520381 i have to have the loudest bass in the world coming out of my trunk
3520382 i have to have the loudest bass in the world coming out of my trunk
3520383 i have to have the loudest bass in the world coming out of my trunk
3520384 to see this actually happens obviously im not pleased with it at all we are held at a much higher standard than anyone else
3520385 i have to have the loudest bass in the world coming out of my trunk
3520386 ive never heard of this person but having a compatriot win a medal at the olympic games is a real honour for us
3520387 top 40 radio stations theyre too busy playing what the record companies want them to play but listen to an indie station like public radio or a college station and you might hear some unusual stuff you might even like some of it go ahead broaden your mind
3520388 women are using abortion as their birth control method of choice
3520389 if we improved access to contraceptives there would be a reduction in abortion
3520390 there is one bit of advice given to us by the ancient heathen greeks and by the jews in the middle ages which the modern economic system has completely disobeyed all these people told us not to lend money at interest and lending money at interest what we now call investment is the basis of our whole system now it may not absolutely follow that we are wrong this is where we want the christian economist
3520391 if you lend money to any of my people who are poor do not require him to pay interest
3520392 if then you have not been faithful in handling worldly wealth how can you be trusted with true wealth
3520393 hoje o fabr cio um jogador diferenciado ele faz uma fun o diferente da que ele fazia no corinthians e ele cresceu muito de produ o a op o para comprar os 50 em dezembro mas a id ia exercer antes est definido que vamos comprar o alvimar presidente e o zez vice de futebol agora v o decidir se o cruzeiro que vai arcar ou se vai entrar um parceiro

3520396 i do think we learn more because we can do more things
3520397 we look at home schooling as a way of life as opposed to the way we educate our children
3520398 i think it has been one of the wisest choices our family has made
3520399 home schooling has created a greater family unity but it has allowed us to sculpt an education program thats met our childrens learning styles and met the desires of their hearts
3520400 freedom it gives my kids to study and learn what theyre interested in
3520401 were very eclectic i dont go out and buy a full curriculum from a publisher
3520402 we pick and choose and use a variety of different resources
3520403 probably there are as many ways to home school out there as there are people out there home schooling
3520404 i dont see children suffering for lack of socialization the opportunities are out there parents and children have to take advantage of them
3520405 if you want your kids to be involved there all kind of ways that your kids can interact with other children
3520406 its nice to have the record but its really more about challenging myself and doing something ive dreamed about for years
3520407 when you climb this mountain as much as we climb it you start looking for a challenge
3520408 now is an opportunity for a new director to continue to move the hospital forward

3520420 were pet people we love our dogs and were always looking for tips and products for caring for and pampering our fur families plus events and destinations that not only tolerate our best friends but welcome them
3520421 dog magazines arent published frequently enough traditional email newsletters always seem to be selling us something and there are simply too many websites and blogs to scour for the dog related information were seeking

3520427 wie weet zit een kleine verrassing er nog wel in waarom niet ik heb een fantastische vrouw we zien wel wat de toekomst brengt
3520428 ik heb een van mijn beste maatjes verloren en dat is niet makkelijk te bevatten
3520429 ik weet dat een vraagteken niet is toegestaan als god ergens een punt achter zet dus ik zal niet klagen over de beslissing van god om hem bij zich te roepen
3520430 hij zal deel blijven uitmaken van mijn muzikale leven elke keer als ik het liedje deja vu zing
3520431 hij was een echte heer en een zeer warme en getalenteerde artiest voor wie ik respect had en die ik heb bewonderd
3520432 ik zal hem missen en zijn bijdrage aan de entertainmentindustrie en de mensheid
3520433 ik was echt een vreselijke echtgenote hij was een lieve man maar ik was echt te jong ik wist niet wie ik was en wat ik moest doen om aan werk te komen
3520434 its trial by fire theres drama here this is a tough town

3520471 forgiveness is gods invention for coming to terms with a world in which despite their best intentions people are unfair to eachother and hurt each other deeply he began by forgiving us and he invited us all to forgive each other
3520472 none of us wants to admit that we hate someone when we deny our hate we detour around the crisis of forgiveness we supress our spite make adjustments and make believe we are too good to be hateful but the truth is that we do not dare risk admitting the hate we feel because we do not dare to risk forgiving the person we hate
3520473 you can forgive someone almoost anything but you cannot tolerate everything we dont have to tolerate what people do just because we forgive them for doing it forgiving heals us personally to tolerate everything only hurts us all in the long run
3520474 with a little time and a little more insight we begin to see both ourselves and our enemies in humbler profiles we arent really as innocent as we felt when we were first hurt
3520475 spoken forgiving no matter how heartfelt works best when we do not demand the response we want i mean that when we tell people we forgive them we must leave them free to respond to our good news however they are inclined if the response is not what we hoped for we can go home and enjoy our own healing in private
3520476 im sorry i did all of this to you thank you so much for forgiving me i love you with all my heart and yes i forgive you too

3520496 the chairman had planned this trip quite some time ago and has in fact reduced it considerably with a view to the champions trophy he has undergone some treatment there and will be back within the next 5 6 days
3520497 there is no link between what is happening with the presidency and the chairman of the board and to suggest as such is completely off the mark the chairman will be back shortly and is very much looking forward to hosting the champions trophy
3520498 the premeditated slaying of john lennon with an essentially clear mind

3520502 i just loved to play so much i went to different clubs and told the guys that if they wanted a night off i would play in their place

3520504 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3520505 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3520506 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3520507 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3520508 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions

3520513 its not like you live at fort hood or camp lejeune and everybody on your street is in the military
3520514 i hate to see so many home and business owners who struggled to rebuild have yet another struggle to relocate
3520515 why tear down more homes if there is a site ready to develop
3520516 placing the hospitals within walking distance would greatly benefit medical students and residents
3520517 the same opportunity simply does not present itself when clinic locations are separated by a car ride
3520518 that medical complex was designed so we would have the forces of the two universities and the va doctors along with the bioinnovation and cancer centers positioned so this city would have one of the greatest medical complexes in the southern united states
3520519 the city of new orleans is pledging its resources to purchase only one site the site we proposed originally
3520520 many healthy downtown medical districts do not have a va hospital
3520521 lets be honest about this and get past the spin why choose a site which will destroy an intact neighborhood
3520522 we need health care now i cannot go to a civilian health care facility because they dont know how to handle veterans health care needs
3520523 we are a special bunch of people and we need special care
3520524 our patients have been exceptionally tolerant because they appreciate the efforts were making on their behalf but its been a long three years and they need their hospital back
3520525 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3520526 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3520527 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3520528 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3520529 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3520530 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3520531 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions
3520532 ms brown is it possible you have a history of perceiving things entirely different than they really happened

3520535 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3520536 anybody who tells you they know when the housing market will bottom is delusional but anybody who denies there are some positives out there that could make the housing market bottom fairly soon is equally delusional
3520537 the key is to try is to get some stability in the price of homes which appears to be happening in california
3520538 california is the linchpin and so if the region flattens that changes everything
3520539 the data came in much better than we were expecting and much better than the market was expecting
3520540 i think a lot of the increase has to do with foreclosure sales which are selling at a quicker pace and have a faster turnaround time
3520541 housing market data is certainly showing early signs of stabilization on the activity side and home price side

3520544 i have preached many times but i have never felt the heaviness of gods spirit as i did monday it was truly amazing to preach where i literally felt like a puppet and god was sending the words out of my mouth the atmosphere was electric and every single person in that room felt something i told some people that after i was done i felt like i had just sky dived because the rush and excitement was so great that my adrenaline was so sky high i was almost shaking it was pretty amazing and my description sounds cheesy but if you could have been there you would have felt it i knew then that god was in this message more than any message i have preached and i couldnt wait to see what he would do next
3520545 god had planned this from the beginning every single speakers message flowed perfectly from the previous speakers message and none of us talked before hand except me and steve amazing i believe god was using these messages to awaken this district there was truly a new excitement to go back to our churches and get to work to do whatever it takes using whatever methods and expending whatever resources to begin to reach our communities in creative and relevant ways god showed up here this week and it was incredible
3520546 if they ever open up this country im coming back right here

3520553 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
3520554 this is a planning took where all things are going
3520555 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3520556 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3520557 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3520558 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3520559 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3520560 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others

3520566 theres a whole world of music that you dont hear anymore and its on 78 rpm records
3520567 i really didnt know there were so many people in the world interested in this music
3520568 a lot of younger people go to the site and its amazing that they hear songs today that originally were recorded 75 years ago its pretty cool that people get to listen to this stuff as far as copyrights apparently im okay because nobodys come to shut me down or anything
3520569 please note that what was considered humor early in the 20th century might today be deemed offensive and politically incorrect some of these old songs reflect that
3520570 my wife told me that i shouldnt put those songs on there because theyre racially offensive or sexually offensive so i asked around and people said you know first amendment do anything you want
3520571 everybody else seems to think well put them up there thats the way they are
3520572 i have an old 1950s gerard turntable that i bought at an estate sale for two and a half bucks and its got a ge general electric vr cartridge in it which is just excellent for playing 78s

3520575 even if nbc takes down one video theres likely to be 20 more sources that people can turn to

3520579 we are seeing an increase in dogs in our sector helping us get to situations faster and screen vehicles much quicker
3520580 theres wind distracting odors agents working around them other dogs and of course the 1 500 vehicles that drive by every hour
3520581 they do this so my dog hits the smell forcing us to pull the car over for a second inspection while the car with the load tries to sneak by a few cars behind
3520582 any little residue and my dog will alert me to it
3520583 we have no confirmation of how these cars are being contaminated but we are checking each car and when our dogs alert us we check the cars behind it too
3520584 i couldnt even try to explain how these dogs find that one concealed person in a van full of people but they do
3520585 thats the part of the job an agent couldnt do alone thats why we have these dogs working with us every day
3520586 the fitness level of these dogs doesnt compare to a house dog
3520587 these dogs are trained to work hard long hours almost every day
3520588 we spend most of the day with our dog they live with us and they work with us
3520589 i end up spending more time with my dog than with my family sometimes
3520590 they also just make poor management decisions like the launch of mango
3520591 there is no company in south africas history that has performed so poorly
3520592 this is theft from the taxpayers pocket for an industry that does not need to be subsidised by government saa is putting a positive spin on a corporate disaster
3520593 saa has received only r653 million in funding from government in the past five years a government guarantee is not a cash injection and thus it does not come from taxpayers
3520594 one of the critical elements of saas restructuring plan which was submitted to government last year and approved is the recapitalisation of the airline to strengthen the balance sheet and prepare the airline for future growth
3520595 the financial results for 2007 08 show that the airline is on a far sounder financial footing than it was 18 months ago
3520596 revenue grew 9 to r22 5 billion cash generated from operations rose more than fourfold to r1 39 billion and operating costs were kept under control despite a r950 million unbudgeted cost flowing through as a result of the sharp rise in the oil price
3520597 most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced
3520598 the gas prices that are wiping out your pay cheques and straining businesses to the jobs that are disappearing from this state
3520599 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
3520600 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
3520601 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
3520602 in no way do i think john mccains campaign was racist
3520603 i think they are cynical their team is good at creating distractions and engaging in negative attacks
3520604 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
3520605 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
3520606 until manufacturers discovered engine balancing increasing power meant increasing engine size which resulted in cars that created tremendous amounts of torque the power in the benz submerges you into the seat and driving it is like nothing youve ever experienced
3520607 i wanted to see what would happen if you put a really high powered engine in a chassis
3520608 the cramer comet is much more than one mans dream it encapsulates the enthusiasm and skill brought home by returning gis

3520613 offshore drilling does not need debate its a false issue one thats negatives far outweighs its minuscule benefits a fact thats been well known for nearly 20 years

3520624 people often talk about this as the internet service revolution
3520625 that will eventually lead to machines that have lots of server capacity lots of low cost computing low cost storage and that will let us write software in an even more ambitious way eliminating the last constraints we have
3520626 i noticed that a number of people mentioned that they felt there was an overtly your turn time to kill sounds good in theory but ive had nothing but bad luck lending games out to friends typically because when i want to get t fall back in
3520627 were concentrating time and space for the breeder so he can do the job in his lifetime

3520632 we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries across the oceans across the mountains across the prairies because we are made of sugar candy
3520633 i think the fear is that somehow large corporations will censor their content their points of view right
3520634 i think the bigger concern for them should be if you have government dictating content policy which by the way would have a big first amendment problem
3520635 then whoever is in charge of government is going to determine what is fair under a so called fairness doctrine which wont be called that itll be called something else
3520636 so will web sites will bloggers have to give equal time or equal space on their web site to opposing views rather than letting the marketplace of ideas determine that
3520637 the fairness doctrine has not been raised at the fcc but the importance of this election is in part has something to do with that
3520638 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate

3520670 its something they wanted to do anyway but maybe needed a little extra impetus
3520671 people have no choice at one point when the pocketbook is empty
3520672 people are kind of lazy about going beyond just posting a trip
3520673 people who might be asked to stay late can just say im in a carpool and i have to leave at 5
3520674 thats a common excuse to get out of the office on time that carries a decent amount of weight ive been in several meetings where that has happened
3520675 we do not comment on our pregame or halftime show plans until we announce the talent i would have said the same thing to the new york post if someone from there would have called before it ran the item
3520676 those with the honour of knowing master cpl doyle which is almost everyone in the canadian army describe him as a warrior who was larger than life
3520677 all who served with erin wanted to be beside him especially at the most dangerous times of the mission
3520678 he could raise morale with a look a gesture or a practical joke
3520679 he passed on all the wealth of his experience to his platoon when he spoke they listened and he never had to repeat himself twice when correcting a soldier
3520680 im personally inspired every day by all the soldiers across the battle group but there are a few across the battle group who inspire me a little more when i come across them and doyle was one of those guys
3520681 he always had some ideas about how we could improve things he always thought twice about what we were doing and how we could make it better
3520682 shes been here for one week and hasnt seen a doctor even though they know she has been shot
3520683 she is complaining of abdominal pain she understands she lost part of an intestine
3520684 in several areas mud and rocks from the mountains have buried entire villages
3520685 the search effort has been difficult because we dont have equipment and the digging has to be done manually
3520686 we are trying our best but we really think they have all died their bodies might be buried below the rubble and they could even have been swept away down the red river

3520701 podr a costar cerca de cinco mil millones de pesos y es un dinero que el pa s no debe gastar

3520703 nadie est obligando a uribe m s bien es l el que est obligando a que lo reelijan
3520704 son m s de mil 600 millones de pesos y eso es un gasto muy grande para un pa s que necesita hacer una reestructuraci n fiscal que tiene m ltiples problemas econ micos y muchas necesidades
3520705 es una irresponsabilidad del presidente decirle no a su reelecci n porque seg n la ex ministra ya se ha invertido mucho dinero y gente en este proceso pero tambi n ser a una irresponsabilidad decirle que s por las consecuencias que ya se han hablado en varias ocasiones

3520716 the last time i spotted makeup was at the katy carnival several months ago but he seems to surface frequently at events or making cameo appearances in remixed in tunes by for nearly a decade
3520717 i spent a lot of time this year traveling to exotic locales such as st tropez and dubai and was inspired by the brightly colored clothing seen there i was able to translate my vision
3520718 the trombone slide was a nice touch but i hope they arent done with the cgi yet this scene could use some tweeting birds circling their heads

3520722 the five or six largest oems will decide what they want to buy in the marketplace and thats what the industry will follow
3520723 we can learn from what the disk drive folks went through back in the early 80s there were dozens of hard drive makers all scrambling to see who would win out now there are only six major ones left theyre still making and selling lots of drives but the main difference now is that shipments are much larger the customers made their choice then and the same thing will happen in flash
3520724 about when am i not going to lose my job for using flash ssds in my servers
3520725 personally i think ssds are a terrible replacement for hhds at this time for a lot of reasons the biggest of which is that they havent been around long enough to know how they really will perform in heavy duty production situations
3520726 few years and that if they were one half or one quarter the cost they are now there would be a lot more adoption by this point
3520727 right now there are about 60 flash vendors and about 17 organizations doing some kind of standards work
3520728 we were sitting down trying to count up the number of standards organizations that are affiliated with flash in some way
3520729 we came up with 17 that we know of there are probably more the tier 1 oems and thats only five or six guys companies are going to define what is successful in the market
3520730 what their strategies are around ssds sun has some other vendors have but the full playing field hasnt been shown yet
3520731 its obviously a broad announcement with lots of notebooks with lots of new features but the real story is the consumer influence on the enterprise product line
3520732 dell has made improvements with the battery life and they talked about security and manageability but what i thought was interesting was the fact they were using web cams different colors and just from a segmentation standpoint they had 10 new products there and thats really broad for a commercial lineup
3520733 delivering silver or black boxes is just not the right answer today so were trying to figure out how commercial customers use their machines not only from a business perspective but from a personal perspective

3520747 she declined it she also declined medical treatment the victim did have visible injuries and we also believe alcohol was involved that will be part of the investigation

3520765 velvet revolvers new album will draw heavily on their messy split with scott the band wanted a big name who could easily hold his own and reckon lenny is just the man for the job
3520766 this band is all about its fans and its music and scott weiland isnt 100 percent committed to either among other things his increasingly erratic onstage behaviour and personal problems have forced us to move on
3520767 70 percent that we studied had at least one of the cdcs top five critical violations
3520768 one opf the violations we saw in a pittsburgh restaurant was a citation for a live roach that was seen on a cutting board another one was for sushi that was stored several degrees higher than the temperature it need to be to inhibit the growth of bacteria
3520769 its not uncommon for us to find violations but the key is whether tose violations are corrected and in most cases they can be corrected instantly

3520780 the disciples were sad dreaded the death of christ and did not understand him but here at the institution of the supper jesus explains to them that his death is to their advantage it is by that death that the very forgiveness and very covenant come about that were foreshadowed and foretold in the old testament the time of promise is past the time of fulfillment is dawning the old is over behold all things are new

3520800 a lot of people asked me last week why im not going back to europe to play for ryder cup points
3520801 a lot of people suggested playing gleneagles where ive won twice but even if was to win at gleneagles thats still not enough points to put me on the team so all i can do is play over here and play great golf and try to win over here and hopefully make my way in on the world points list
3520802 ive played some really good golf the last month or so
3520803 i played disappointing golf at the beginning of the year which is why im not straight on that ryder cup team as i would like to have been right now i cant put it down the last few weeks thats for sure
3520804 i want to play over here i dont want to jet backwards and forewards and get jet lagged and everything even if i get lucky and get on that team which is what i really want to do i dont want to be fatigued this is my first year playing the fedexcup which im excited about i didnt get to play it last year so im looking forward to the next few weeks out
3520805 hopefully ill get better at it trying to play both
3520806 i want to play both my ultimate goal is to win majors i love playing in europe its my home tour its where i started out

3520809 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier

3520821 we are really getting to the point where nypd is going to be tracking our movements all over the city everyday

3520827 i came back and the jeep and dog were gone
3520828 rcmp do know who took my jeep but they cant find him
3520829 i have friends from peachland to enderby knocking on doors and handing out flyers ive been to all the dog controls from westbank to enderby and ive put posters up everywhere you can imagine
3520830 then the fifth vehicle wasnt able to stop in time to avoid hitting the car in front of it and that was the first rear ender the sixth vehicle hit the fifth and that created the domino effect of one car rear ending another
3520831 i believe it was the forth and fifth vehicle which caught fire the fire department says it looks like the fuel pump in one of the vehicles got cracked during the crash and thats what started the fire
3520832 whats really amazing is no one was seriously hurt there are a few cases of whiplash but thats it there were four children in one of the vehicles which caught fire but they had all gotten out okay
3520833 drivers need to remember to leave more space between them and other vehicles so that when you come across blocked traffic you have time to stop
3520834 it seems to me that if mr obama wins the presidential election then messrs farrakhan wright ayers and pfleger will gain power for their need to demoralize this country and help create a socialist america
3520835 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3520836 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3520837 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3520838 it lets us get deeper into some of the other characters that only have very small stories generally so i always enjoy em i think people like to see whats going on with some of the characters who only get grunts or reactions when michael says something stupid

3520842 i think anderson cooper is an opinionated hypocritical idiot who should be an adult and keep his opinion to himself he is the last person to judge anyone when he and his own family have their own issues

3520844 i have this thing where its like okay ive chosen to bungee jump off this ledge i have to do it
3520845 and if the cord snaps well i might as well enjoy the ride down
3520846 i think ricky made all the difference in the world
3520847 his defensive presence was spectacular the guards from china couldnt get the ball past half court and that changed the face of the game
3520848 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles

3520860 sandeman has really been coming on strong and competing extremely hard the last four practices or so we have a lot of good competition at the x position with derrell johnson koulianos and colin at this stage brodell is a veteran guy and knows what hes doing he made the catches that came his way today which he needs to do the tight ends allen reisner showed up and made some big plays as well today chaney did a nice job and hes starting to play full speed some of the young guys who are making plays at the wide receiver position steve staggs had a nice play at the end of practice ben evans those guys have all been pushing for their chances to show what they can do when the ball is thrown their way
3520861 a lot more work than they normally do at this point in time
3520862 the no 1 step were taking is something we call practice
3520863 we still use it and do it the old fashioned way our guys have been practicing hard working on fundamentals and technique to use at their position to be efficient players weve been focused on the fundamental aspects of things and a lot of that showed up on the field this afternoon
3520864 like kevin costner said this isnt heaven its iowa our players feed off of our fans as coaches we appreciate the fan base and support that we get we know this isnt heaven but its iowa and it feels great knowing that we have great support we think it is the best there is anywhere in the country were a small state but we have a mighty fan base and great great support
3520865 the thing that has gotten in jakes way more than anything else has been his consistency
3520866 he started slow the first two or three days of preseason but he has really come on especially the last three or four practices in his consistency and performance its one thing to be able to make a throw one out of every two times were looking to make it all the time and thats starting to show up a little more which is what we need to have because we want to have increased passing efficiency
3520867 to get experience under your belt on the practice field is one thing
3520868 to get it under your belt in a game situation is much more valuable those guys understand whats going on theyve been coached theyve been a part of what were doing and their base of knowledge is a lot greater than it used to be that allows them to be more confident and trust their techniques and fundamentals on the field more where theyre not worried about what they should be doing as much and theyre focused on how theyre doing it
3520869 our players feed off of our fans as coaches we appreciate the fan base and support that we get we know this isnt heaven but its iowa and it feels great knowing that we have great support we think it is the best there is anywhere in the country were a small state but we have a mighty fan base and great great support
3520870 i was just having so much fun driving around in the golf cart wes was in the middle of a golf lesson and i just didnt see her there
3520871 how many times do i have to apologize for that
3520872 i know theyre not real but i cant bare to watch any zombie movies they scare me so much
3520873 look i know it sounds crazy as sunscreen in a rainstorm but when you woke up and described that room to me and what you were doing in your dream you know counting the shells i knew before you finished explaining because i had been there watching you im sorry i didnt mean to be there but i was
3520874 it doesnt make sense you cant know you cant have seen my dream its just not possible i dont want to think about the alternative i like being able to explain my world maybe i was talking in my sleep and you heard me in yours is that possible
3520875 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts
3520876 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
3520877 theres a lot of tumbling falling and flipping that is usually not as well supervised as a sport like gymnastics
3520878 something that we really do need to be aware of
3520879 we need to have better guidelines in place and make people aware that this is a sport that does involve risk
3520880 i think its shocking in a sense to recognize that a sport that a lot of people consider as a sideline sport really is a problematic sport
3520881 following cheerleading rules and safety manual guidelines that are written by cheerleading experts is an excellent way to help prevent cheerleading injuries
3520882 the crazy thing about this is that we dont even care we are not going to harm them we just want to know were they went
3520883 i dont know the tax collector and the big man came out of nowhere attacked us and went that way
3520884 that sound really is wings it is your death approaching it is the dragon that they have been talking about the one who eats mens bodies and devours their souls we would have let you live but now nothing will help you

3520953 in the run up to the olympics it seems that chinese authorities are so obsessed with projecting an image of stability and harmony that they have really come down quite hard on human rights activists and lawyers
3520954 the peoples republic of china the olympics countdown broken promises
3520955 the chinese authorities have used the olympics and the cleanup before the olympics as an excuse to maintain and extend a draconian detention system that they had called re education through labor
3520956 what that really means is that theyre punished through forced labor to be taught a lesson and thousands of people who have ordinary complaints or demand reforms of the chinese government have instead been rounded up
3520957 we hope amnesty international can take off the colored glasses it has worn for many years and see china in an objective way
3520958 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
3520959 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
3520960 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few web sites that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
3520961 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games
3520962 chinas political reality is a place where no freedom of expression will really be allowable this goes for the chinese people and the foreign journalists
3520963 china is always afraid that if it lets its own people speak freely and spontaneously organize by itself the chinese communist party could be endangered or even be threatened
3520964 they also feel since they got the olympics the world is coming anyway by this point they can just do what they want and just let the world tolerate rather than have to fundamentally change their own behavior
3520965 beijings public air quality reporting has been a misinformation campaign
3520966 individuals traveling to the 2008 olympic summer games should plan and prepare for the high levels of outdoor pollutant in beijing and limit or avoid outdoor exercise
3520967 this is really a significant opportunity lost for the chinese government to show to the world that they really trust their own people a sign of a china that is ready to take its place in the first ranks in the nations of the world

3521000 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3521001 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3521002 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3521003 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3521004 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3521005 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3521006 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3521007 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3521008 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3521009 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3521010 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3521011 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3521012 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3521063 we want to come out and play well against philly we didnt last year and it showed
3521064 we want to build from one game to the next and thats something we want to concentrate on this week
3521065 we want to go out and do well but if we dont its not the end of the world these are preseason games we do want to build on it we want to treat it like a stepping stone and we want to become better rather than get worse

3521067 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3521068 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3521069 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3521070 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3521071 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3521072 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3521073 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3521079 web site tmonews is predicting a t mobile pre sale of the new android based htc dream to existing customers beginning september 17
3521080 this is typical for an unauthorized video of an unannounced product its shaky and out of focus nevertheless it shows a few details on the dream a model that htc has been remorkably successful and keeping under wraps
3521081 imagine if red hat released a version of linux and after it was deployed customers noticed that any processes with a start date of today would refuse to run well thats what happened to vmware a company that wants nearly all server applications running in virtual machines within a matter of years

3521089 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3521090 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3521091 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3521097 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3521098 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3521099 porque os mesmos que o mataram se apressaram em faz lo her i 30 anos depois

3521103 but the worst enemy of the belmont debate could be other debates just like it sen john mccain the presumptive republican presidential nominee has solicited presumptive democratic nominee sen barack obama to have 10 town hall debates across the country which could make belmonts debate old hat by the time it happens

3521106 the chinese government should immediately release ji sizun and anyone else detained by police while trying to exercise their basic rights
3521107 the protest application process clearly isnt about giving people greater freedom of expression but making it easier for the police to suppress it
3521108 people or protesters who want to express their personal opinions can go to do so
3521109 nobody should confuse the lack of protesters with a lack of complaints
3521110 the detention and harassment of those who tried to take the government at its word shows the lengths to which the authorities will go to keep people from peacefully expressing their views

3521232 what is more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose
3521233 would force firms to spend money to automate their systems and would add costs to both brokers and customers in the form of increased borrowers fees
3521234 in this time of economic uncertainty that would not be a popular outcome for wall street
3521235 will continue exploring other remedies for the broader marketplace to further protect investors from distort and short artists

3521244 i think there are things to be done on the venues still and i havent lifted my reserve on that there are also i think serious questions to be asked about the legacy value of some of the sites and some of the venues
3521245 where we are is broadly pretty good for the stage of the electoral cycle it provides us with a good launching pad for the next election
3521246 i personally believe that despite the attempt at enormous spin from the conservative party which seems to be in serious danger of becoming exceptionally complacent and self congratulatory that all the evidence is that we will gain seats at the next election
3521247 most winnable seats and our most marginal seats were all against the labour to conservative then you will find that we will be gaining as many potential seats as we will be losing and i would actually say its very unlikely that were going to lose seats to the conservatives
3521248 after the glasgow east by election no one can doubt that
3521249 this is much more serious than mid term blues which may be expected to evaporate as the general election approaches
3521250 so what types of digging need to stop first is the frantic search for some magic populist policy solution there is no single get out of jail card and it is foolish to believe that such simplistic solutions will do the trick
3521251 indeed some are counter productive inviting the publics contempt by implying a desperation to buy support by ditching unpopular taxes or offering dubious incentives
3521252 dangling the carrot of home ownership in front of low income council tenants in current market conditions for example is a deeply suspect proposition
3521253 just as dubious is the siren call for more initiatives one of the greatest mistakes in government is to confuse activity with outcomes just because ministers feel busy devising 101 new ways of tackling a problem does not guarantee the problem gets solved
3521254 much less clear is the inevitability of defeat the historical parallel is closer to 1990 than 1995
3521255 while the thatcher government was deeply unpopular in 1990 losing the eastbourne by election on a similar swing to glasgow east the electorate had not yet committed to labour as the next government

3521276 the two encounters against anorthosis are very important for us
3521277 they wont be easy because our opponents are also looking forward to participating in the group stage in these matches theres the motto all or nothing if we qualify everything will be ok if not zero we have to complete our signings and dedicate ourselves to the preparation for these two ties
3521278 there were two things that cost us in the game lack of european experience and over enthusiasm
3521279 after getting the away goal in the first leg we went ahead in the second leg at home we got carried away when we scored first because we all felt that we were close to qualifying for the group stage but after olympiacos equalised we just fell to pieces
3521280 anorthosis today have far more players that have that experience of playing big european games
3521281 we respect sparta they are a good team with good players
3521282 in order to progress we need a positive result that can be a victory a draw or even a narrow defeat i believe qualification will be sealed in the second leg in athens but we will try to score tomorrow because an away goal can make all the difference
3521283 we need to qualify and it is imperative that we get a good result in prague
3521284 we are ready have worked very hard during pre season and are in with a very good chance of qualifying for the group stage
3521285 i hope so you know if i havent proved enough to people in the last eight wins they really dont know anything about this sport and arent really fans of the sport
3521286 the biggest strategy with georges was to stay in his face and never really sit still and never really let him get off first ive seen a lot of fights where people sit and wait for him and with his speed you cant do that
3521287 it took all of the first round to adjust to how fast he is
3521288 and by that time he had hit me so many times in the left eye that i couldnt really see him
3521289 i caught him with a nice knee at the end of the third or the beginning of the fourth kept throwing right hands trying to hit that cut see if i could open it up more

3521320 i cant support fuelwatch in the way its been put up by the government
3521321 the governments fuelwatch scheme wont deliver benefits to consumers as has been asserted
3521322 when you consider that four government departments have said that this could actually put prices up rather than down when youve heard the evidence from the senate committee process its been quite damning
3521323 weve seen from the perth experience that it has forced a number of independent operators out of business
3521324 the actual mechanism thats been proposed by the government for fuelwatch would actually make things worse
3521325 i dont know if its a question of tweaking i think it has to be a lot more than tweaking
3521326 with fuelwatch itself family first has serious concerns and were still wanting to understand how it wont push average petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents and until were satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch either
3521327 if you were to ask motorists do you want less volatility in petrol prices they would probably say yes but if you were to ask motorists that it would come at a cost of purchasing petrol at a higher average price they would probably say im not so sure about that and thats the question at hand
3521328 its not a rubber stamp any more and it means the australian public cannot be taken for granted
3521329 so it shall be done to the man who will not build up his brothers house and him name shall be called in israel
3521330 your commandments i have not transgressed nor have i forgotten
3521331 today you have proclaimed the lord to be your god and that you will walk in his ways and keep his statutes his commandments his judgments and that you will obey his voice
3521332 take heed and listen o israel this day you have become the lords people therefore you shall obey his voice and observe his commandments and statutes which i command you today
3521333 therefore keep the words of this covenant and do them that you may prosper in all that you do
3521334 i shall have peace even though i follow the dictates of my heart as though the drunkard could be included with the sober sidebar this chapter reveals that the lord and moses knew that the israelites would reject gods laws and
3521335 now it shall come to pass when all these things come upon you the blessing and the curse which i have set before you and you call them to mind among all the nations where the lord your god drives you and you return to the lord your god and obey his voice
3521336 see i have set before you today life and good death and evil in that i command you today to love the lord your god to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments his statutes and his judgments that you may live and multiply and the lord will bless you in the land that you go to possess
3521337 put it in their mouths that this song may be a witness for me against the children of israel
3521338 for it will not be forgotten in the mouths of their descendants for i know the inclination of their behavior today even before i have brought them into the land of which i swore to give them
3521339 take this book of the law and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the lord our god that it may be there as a witness against you for i know your rebellion your stiff neck if today while i am yet alive you have been rebellious against the lord the how much more after my death
3521340 gather all the elders of your tribes and your officers that i may speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to witness against them for i know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt and turn aside from the way which i have commanded you and evil will befall you in the latter days because you will do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands
3521341 set your hearts on all the words which i testify among you today which you shall command your children to be careful to observe all the words of this law for it is not a futile thing for you because it is your life and by this word shall you prolong your days in the land
3521342 which i give to the children of israel as a possession and die on the mountain which you ascend and be gathered to your people just as aaron your brother died on mt hor and was gathered to his people
3521343 and he came with ten thousands of saints from his right hand went a fiery law for them yea he loved the people all his saints are in thy hand and they sat down at thy feet every one shall receive of thy words
3521344 would you like to have a family to come home too
3521345 do no become ensnared by the gods of the nations that they dispossessed inquiring as to how these nations serve their god you shall not do likewise
3521346 lets go serve other gods which you have not known do not listen because the lord is testing you to know whether you love him with all your heart and soul 1 3
3521347 you shall open your hand wide to your brother to your poor and your needy in your land
3521348 i will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brethren and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak to them all that i command
3521349 how shall we knot the word which the lord has not spoken
3521350 if you keep all these commandments and do them which i command you today to love the lord your god and to walk in his ways then you shall add three more cities lest innocent blood be shed in the midst of your land which the lord is giving you as an inheritance and thus guilt of bloodshed be upon you but the one who hates his neighbor lies in wait for him rises against him and kills him and flees to a city of refuge then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him from there and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood that he may die
3521351 when you go to battle against your enemies do not be afraid
3521352 do not let your heart faint do not be afraid do not tremble or be terrified because of them
3521353 when you go near a city to fight against it proclaim an offer of peace to it
3521354 our hands have not shed blood and our eyes have not seen it provide atonement o lord for your people israel whom you have redeemed and do not lay innocent blood to the charge of your people israel

3521360 enough of that speak no more to me of this matter
3521361 you shall not add to the words which i command you nor take from it that you may keep the commandments of the lord your god
3521362 be careful to observe them for this is your wisdom and your understanding
3521363 however he tells them that when they do break the covenant that
3521364 the statutes and judgments which i speak to you today
3521365 they have spoken right oh that they had such a heart in them that they would
3521366 we were slaves in egypt and the lord brought us out with a mighty hand and showed signs and wonders before our eyes he brought us out of there that he might bring us into the land he swore to our fathers and
3521367 we were slaves in egypt and the lord brought us out with a mighty hand and showed us signs and wonders before our eyes he brought us out of there that he might bring us into the land he swore to our fathers and
3521368 a people great and tall descendants of the anakim so understand today that the
3521369 i have seen this people and indeed they are a stiff necked people let me alone that i might destroy them and blot out their name from under the heaven and i will make of you moses a nation mightier and greater than they
3521370 therefore you shall love the lord your god and keep his charge his statutes his judgments and his commandments always
3521371 but your eyes have see all the great acts of the lord which he did
3521372 take vengeance on the midianites for the children of israel
3521373 kill all the male children and every woman that has laid with a man but all the virgins they could keep
3521374 this is the ordinance of the law which the lord commanded moses only the gold silver brass iron tin and lead every thing that may abide the fire shall go thru the fire and it shall be clean but still it must be purified with the water of separation and you shall wash your clothes and be clean afterward you may come into the camp
3521375 shall your brethren go to war while you sit here
3521376 you have risen to your fathers place a brood of sinful men to increase more the anger of the lord against israel for if you turn away from following him he will once again leave them in the wilderness and you will destroy all these people
3521377 but that all those armed for war will remain ready to go before the children of israel until we have brought them to their place
3521378 build cities for your little ones and folds for you sheep and do what proceeded out of your mouth moses commanded the priest joshua and the fathers of the tribes of israel concerning the tribes of reuben gad and half the tribe of manasseh

3521384 god will use anybody to get his message across to you
3521385 but only the word that i speak to you that you shall speak
3521386 did i not tell you all that the lord speaks that i must do
3521387 what this people would do to them in the latter days
3521388 that they defile not the camp because the lord dwelt in the midst
3521389 those who are unclean at the appointed time or far away could observe the passover in the following month on the appointed day
3521390 you know this wilderness stay and be to israel as one who knows the landscape and if you go with us the goodness that the lord shall do to us we shall do to you
3521391 rise up lord and let thine enemy be scatterd and let them that hate you flee before you
3521392 so shall she be kept outside the camp for seven days

3521399 the real aim of lent is above all else to prepare men for the celebration of the death and resurrection of christ one can effectively relive the mystery only with purified mind and heart the purpose of lent is to provide that purification by weaning men from sin and selfishness through self denial and prayer by creating in them the desire to do gods will and to make his kingdom come by making it come first of all in their hearts

3521472 the ratio of about one contractor employee for every member of the u s armed forces in the iraq theater is at least 2 5 times higher than that ratio during any other major u s conflict although it is roughly comparable with the ratio during operations in the balkans in the 1990s
3521473 the costs of a private security contract are comparable with those of a u s military unit performing similar functions
3521474 the private security contract would not have to be renewed whereas the military unit would remain in the force structure
3521475 were earning up to 1 222 a day this amounts to 445 000 a year by contrast an army sergeant was earning 140 to 190 a day in pay and benefits a total of 51 100 to 69 350 a year
3521476 those figures however are not appropriate for comparing the cost effectiveness of contracting the security function or performing it using military personnel
3521477 debunks much of the mythology around the cost and role of contractors supporting the current military reconstruction and economic development efforts in iraq

3521515 wed seen what we call contact calls or vocalizations between aurora and the calf decreasing so we felt pretty confident that aurora wasnt going to be as possessive and strongly bonded with the calf as she was at the very beginning
3521516 aurora did go and try to pick up the calf and she successfully did that for a while
3521517 qila then had trouble getting the calf back away from grandmother but she managed to do that then everything settled down and they were swimming together for most of the night
3521518 our greatest wish was that these animals would get along well together
3521519 likewise wives be subject to your own husbands so that even if some do not obey the word they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives when they see your respectful and pure conduct do not let your adorning be external the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry or the clothing you wear but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit which in gods sight is very precious for this is how the holy women who hoped in god used to adorn themselves by submitting to their own husbands as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord and you are her children if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening

3521525 this is the most intense crisis in u s russia relations since the end of the cold war
3521526 this is a setback for u s russia relations and it will make it very difficult for this administration to push forward any kind of positive initiative
3521527 this will confirm the views of those that have been russia critics and have taken the harder line
3521528 thats whats at stake when russia engages in behavior that looks like its from another time

3521536 the eu grand strategy is to develop georgia as an alternative route for caspian oil and gas by bypassing russia
3521537 but if georgia is no longer a safe passageway then all of these schemes for diminished dependency on russia go up in smoke

3521543 where you have a phobia youre getting a false alarm youre getting a strong hunch that something terrible is going to happen either to the bridge or to you or to the airplane or sometimes people say im not worried about the bridge its just me im going to have a panic attack

3521555 scheme with subtle semantic extensions that programmers probably wont notice unless they actually use them
3521556 ah heck i always wanted to design my own lisp
3521557 our first concern was we didnt ever want the jokes to be on vets or war or the horrors of that
3521558 thats where we calibrated our scopes how do we constantly keep the jokes on actors hollywood and how hollywood works
3521559 we were just careful to always keep the humor where it belongs which is on the lunacy of hollywood and the way things are cast and the fact that that guy could get that role even today as laurence olivier did when he played othello
3521560 theres a whole slew of bad stereotypes that comes out of those movies especially in the more inferior films
3521561 theres always the grizzled slightly older sarge the young jewish kid from brooklyn the black guy from detroit whos always listening to some bad transistor radio the fat guy whos lovable and almost gets them all killed because he cant run
3521562 the public sort of understands that certain movies just have certain people in them if its an action movie its going to be one of five people if its a dramatic part with a guy who has to transform and put on 50 pounds and make his hair gray its going to be one of five people
3521563 its not the riskiest thing in the world casting huge budget movies
3521564 its not like theyre giving cracks to guys out of juilliard what would have been shocking is if theyd said it was someone who had just done three broadway shows in a row
3521565 eventually we struck on the idea wouldnt it be funny if it was an awards guy who was going so in depth to play this part that he actually got the role of the african american sergeant lincoln osyrus
3521566 i had to represent because they had one good part in here for a black guy and they gave it to a white guy
3521567 some people have been upset about that particular joke and i understand their concern
3521568 were not putting mentally challenged people in our scopes again the focus is on the movies weve seen hundreds and billions of them some of those movies are wonderful and then there are others where you think this is clearly someones vanity project and theyre doing it for a very particular reason and people should be just as offended at that so we wanted to tee that up and take a swing at that as well

3521572 positive sentiment seen at the end of the first quarter that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived
3521573 in the second half of this year ubs does not expect to see any improvement in the adverse economic and financial market trends that affected this quarters results
3521574 the good news in these results is the break up of the group into three autonomous units because this allows for an eventual sale or part sale of the investment bank
3521575 we think we have reached the trough of the wave on the net new money outflow that would take time to come back to a more normal level
3521576 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3521577 others have led to the creation of excessively elaborate processes and unnecessary layers of complexity

3521586 you play maybe 500 plays a year and you get 10 sacks
3521587 that means youve got 490 other plays what did you do on those plays did you give up a 40 yard run did you not do your job just cause you get 10 sacks yeah theyre huge plays dont get me wrong but theres a lot more to football than sacks
3521588 just because youre a starter doesnt mean youre going to start the next day or even the next year
3521589 its going to end one day and it very well could have ended for me as far as starting last year mark played great his first year but nobody really played great last year you cant just put it on mark but i was fortunate to get another opportunity to come back and start
3521590 i dont believe i ever got complacent i never got comfortable but i kind of expected to start and you shouldnt you shouldnt expect anything granted i did have my best sack year with 7 in 06 and i lost my job things happen for a reason but im not real sure why that happened but everythings good now last year is last year
3521591 im pretty excited about how everything has worked out with everybody
3521592 not just myself but youve got contract extensions for desmond clark lack brian urlacher devin hester and tommie harris all the off the field stuff is worked out now weve just got to go play and with the defense we have we should be the best in the league we should be i bet we will be just watch
3521593 i dont really care if i ever get 10 well actually i do
3521594 i would love to get 10 just so people cant say hes never gotten 10 sacks they could leave that alone but i do a lot of other stuff and i take pride in that
3521595 you can get pressure on a quarterback and he throws an interception the defensive end never gets any credit for that but as a team we got an interception thats what we want

3521849 so the funny thing is the bullet to the head didnt kill her
3521850 ah yes so according to my tests she had a heart attack around 3 p m that killed her but she didnt get shot in the face until 8 30 p m
3521851 this doesnt make sense why would somebody shoot a woman who had a heart attack and died in the face over three hours later and then cover her in cabbage and set her on fire and then leave pictures of whitney houston lying around everywhere
3521852 i guess it kind of looks like her sure as hell explains why bobby brown was there
3521853 i understood some of that i dont know how there werent any ss in that sentence
3521854 i think bobby and whitney were doing some blow and thing got out of hand she takes a little too much and has a heart attack then bobby runs to the bedroom and gets his pistol he borrowed from charlie sheen out of the k swiss tennis shoe box in his closet and he goes into the kitchen and puts one between her eyes and says thats my prerogative bitch and then he kicks her in the stomach just to let her know hes not playing around then he thinks to himself oh bobby brown youve done it this time you gonna have some splaining to do so he figures hell set her on fire so people think she spontaneously combusted so he gets some cabbage and covers her with it because he thinks cabbage burns well little does he know cabbage not only doesnt burn well it gives off an odor so strong you can smell it for miles kinda smells like fig newtons the neighbors smell it call us
3521855 santiago go get the malibu warmed up we bout to catch us some bobby brown and thats
3521856 they jumped in the air and gave each other a high five
3521857 yeah i bet you did santiago twin brothers think alike

3521860 all righty thatll be 26 50 would you like a pastry with that for just 12 more
3521861 wow you guys are cheaper than the starbucks in california

3521863 i used to sell snacks to all the people around here when they were taking a break from lunch or coming or going from work see the new mexico heat can get to you so i was able to make an okay living providing cool drinks and snacks
3521864 i was so stupid three weeks ago some smancy pancy business man in a green apron approached me makin nice talk and i just thought he was here to chit chat eventually he asked me how much i made selling my drinks and i told him sometimes i make up to 80 in day then he started licking his lips and rubbing his hands together and i should have known then that all happened on a monday and ill be darned if that shop wasnt bought and opened by wednesday so now i only make 3 a day from some blind man who keeps thinking that im that coffee shop over yonder and now im going to have to shut down and sell my belongings
3521865 yeah but that doesnt count because i want more than that

3521867 i can say that david silva wants to play in spain next season
3521868 i dont know where he will play it could be valencia but it will be for a team here in spain he doesnt want to play in another country at the moment
3521869 valencia have the power in their hands david silva cant go to another team because he has a contract for five more years
3521870 he is a player i have followed for some time through my contacts with the swedish national team
3521871 i watched him closely with his club side and we did a lot of research on him
3521872 i spoke a few times with the manager and thats why i came to fulham
3521873 it is a good club and hopefully we wont battle against relegation this season

3521875 frankly the controller has a track record of political mischief

3521878 he coupet is still in my plans the truth will come in september
3521879 we will see it isnt because he is 42 makelele is 35 that he is finished like all the others it depends on your level of play whether you are 42 or 18
3521880 he has great potential and ability and i still believe in him he still has the kind of ability to get back to the level he showed in 2006
3521881 there are injuries so he has the chance to show me what he can do and maybe get picked again he has power and desire
3521882 fuck if you agree fuck if you understand me i love being misunderstood

3521900 yes sorry i thought id catch up on my sleep i didnt realize how tired i actually was how long was i out of it
3521901 yes i remember this jordan character seems to have his head screwed on right for a change and level heads are a must at this point in the game
3521902 this is senior elder lyle loomis of the elders committee over at the center andrew kenfer has asked that i contact you and act as liaison between you and the centers probe command staff as i understand it you have been assigned to reactivate the original prototype probe and advise us when your task has been completed
3521903 yes sir mr kenfers personal secretary contacted me a few days ago and i have been working non stop toward that end
3521904 good did you receive the reinforcements to help with the reactivation you should have at least two able bodies to start with and should you need more please speak up now
3521905 two technicians arrived the day after my conversation with mr kenfers secretary i also received the unlock codes to the probes secure sub lab with all equipment and records the same day i took the liberty of opening all areas and familiarizing myself with the program before my help arrived i can report that although we will need to have a few more days due to the disassembly that occurred when the project was shelved we appear to have all that we need at the moment to continue with the reactivation process
3521906 it sounds like we have the right man for the job so im going to give you some need to know information to save time prep the probe for two individuals were aware that only one usually travels on any particular mission but we will need a second body for back up on this trip we have a critical situation to correct and cannot fail
3521907 there are a few items of equipment that have been rendered useless due to advancements in the design of later probes i can remove them and that should free up the space youll need for the second traveler you do know sir that this model has no virtual interior movement capabilities the travelers will literally have to remain in the command chairs while in transit
3521908 comfort is the least of my concerns this time around

3522024 geesh didnt anyone actually listen to what dr paul said
3522025 one of the reasons the establishment came down so hard on the paul campaign was that there lurks in the constitutionalist message not only an ideological resolution to the amoral postmodern statist status quo but actual hope for some concrete change
3522026 wsc says as far out as this sound one of the most plausible ideas ive come across for potentially affecting change would be for the ron paul grassroots to literally physically relocate to a handful of specific states
3522027 one of the lessons of the paul campaign is that ideology aint all its cracked up to be
3522028 how do i set up a blog like you have done please advise

3522032 lessons of the paul campaign politics is a science of the heart
3522033 just how many folks simply hang up on telemarketers even if they were to have the deal of the century to offer
3522034 sheeple is pretty much sick to death of politics by now and arent likely to be very receptive if at all until after the general election wait until the election and inauguration are history and then get back to educating the masses in full force

3522036 we really wanted this functionality for yahoo services but by opening it up for the rest of the web consumers are more likely to adopt it
3522037 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3522038 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3522039 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3522040 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3522041 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3522042 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3522043 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3522044 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3522045 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3522046 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3522047 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3522048 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3522049 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3522050 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3522051 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3522052 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3522053 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3522054 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3522055 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3522056 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3522057 who are open to doing something on the production side
3522058 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3522059 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3522060 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3522061 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3522062 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3522063 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3522064 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3522065 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3522066 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3522067 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3522068 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3522069 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3522070 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3522071 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3522072 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3522073 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3522074 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3522075 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3522076 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3522077 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3522078 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3522079 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3522080 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3522081 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3522082 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3522083 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3522084 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3522085 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3522086 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3522087 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3522088 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3522089 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3522090 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3522091 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3522092 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3522093 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3522094 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3522095 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3522096 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3522097 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3522098 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3522099 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3522100 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3522101 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3522102 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3522103 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3522104 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3522105 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3522106 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3522107 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3522108 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3522109 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3522110 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3522111 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3522112 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3522113 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3522114 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3522115 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3522116 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3522117 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3522118 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3522119 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3522120 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3522121 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3522122 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3522123 despite the bank s internal worries the publication of the rbv s 1923 annual report to shareholders published in may 1924 reads on the whole upbeat blaming the bank s minor problems on the economic cycle

3522140 eu fiz um relato ao presidente sobre aquela audi ncia p blica realizada no minist rio da justi a para debater se crimes de tortura praticados durante o regime militar est o cobertos pela lei da anistia e informei a ele que em nenhum momento algu m prop s revis o da lei da anistia e o presidente consolidou a posi o que n s defend amos durante a semana passada de que qualquer interpreta o sobre a lei da anistia uma interpreta o que cabe ao judici rio e o poder executivo n o vai compartilhar dessa decis o

3522142 o presidente consolida e orienta que todas essas quest es relacionadas lei da anistia sejam direcionadas para o futuro
3522143 n o me arrependo de emitir essa opini o porque defendi apenas um conceito de que tortura n o crime pol tico a respeito de uma quest o que est presente na sociedade e regulada por tratados internacionais e n o recebi nenhuma advert ncia do presidente em rela o a isso

3522208 i mean its hard i dont really feel as though i played badly i made one mistake basically at that point of time and then couldnt get it back obviously against top players you cant afford to make one mistake but its not very often where you just absolutely get blown off the court like 20 minutes later
3522209 that is not as military contingent we have only increased the contingent of peacekeeping forces
3522210 for showing responsibility for a firm consolidated position to support the decisions of russian authorities that were made under such difficult conditions

3522216 global credit markets continue to negatively impact access and pricing of wholesale funds for australian and overseas banks and it is possible that the situation may worsen in the short term
3522217 from a position of strength the australian economy continues to slow with subdued retail spending levels and tighter labour market conditions expected
3522218 due to the reduced exposure to equities and effective hedging revaluations of the mortgage insurance investment portfolio contributed 2 million to pre tax profit in the first four months of the second half compared to a pre tax loss of 33 million in the first half
3522219 given the deliberate rebalancing of the portfolio volatility will be substantially reduced going forward
3522220 st george has now completed 100 of its 2008 financial year term wholesale funding requirements and has already raised 3 3 billion of its estimated 11 billion to 12 billion term wholesale funding requirements for 2009
3522221 notwithstanding the success to date in completing the groups funding program access to markets and pricing will continue to be challenging for all sector participants due to the expected volatility and possible worsening of the funding markets
3522222 it is difficult to accurately forecast the impact due to the uncertainty going forward
3522223 if ive been paying you money for something you havent given me then thats theft isnt it theft is a crime so ill see you in court
3522224 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3522225 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3522226 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3522227 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3522228 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3522229 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3522230 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3522231 imagine all the girls ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah and the boys ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah and the strings eee eee eee eee eee eee eee eee and the drums the drums the drums the drums the drums the drums the drums the drums the drums the drums the drums the drums

3522233 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3522234 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3522235 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3522236 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3522237 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3522238 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3522239 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3522240 over 70 percent of total global emissions are generated from cities and if you dont measure these emissions you cannot manage them

3522243 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3522244 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3522245 too many corporations are using tax trickery to send their profits overseas and avoid paying their fair share in the united states
3522246 im not trying to imply that there arent tax compliance issues among small corporations
3522247 but when you are talking about businesses that size i would suspect the norm would be to not pay taxes and theres nothing nefarious about that
3522248 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3522249 discusiones internacionales sobre el estatus futuro y las modalidades de seguridad duradera de abjazia y osetia del sur

3522252 ya saben la diferencia entre los lun ticos y otras personas es que cuando huelen la sangre es dif cil detenerlos hay que usar ciruj a

3522254 between july and august we have started to see a very interesting pattern in term of volume and sophistication of e mail threats incoming
3522255 around july 20 we started seeing a spoofed ups tracking e mail messages going to users on july 24 saw a peak of 10 million messages
3522256 now were seeing multiple topics each one linked to different servers
3522257 we didnt see any exploits our security team was on the ball on this dns from the get go
3522258 whenever we see an unusual spike its not always the case that spammers have increased their volume arbitrarily
3522259 it is the case that a few vendors have been ineffective at detecting the links once spammers figure that someone is not detecting their technique really well they pummel the system
3522260 a lot of problems occur because when customers take on these challenges for themselves whether its with an appliance or software they are setting themselves up for scaling the infrastructure
3522261 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3522262 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3522263 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3522264 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3522265 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3522266 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3522267 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3522268 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3522269 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3522270 talks will never collapse as long as we have tongues
3522271 it is a result of the alert vigilant and patriotic manner they have conducted their day to day duties
3522272 wont be an origin story per se but the origin will be covered
3522273 we wanted to do something very different because this is the first chance to see a slasher movie where there is more than one slasher because it follows a hunter youre going with her and her accomplice as they go from one to another and building out the mythology of how this world works with its undead slashers
3522274 this doesnt mean you go free it just means you have a better chance at a fair trial
3522275 it was an inversion of how the process of meting out justice typically works
3522276 normally you have the crime first and then you find the criminals when we showed up they already had the criminals we were tasked with finding the crimes
3522277 the farther back you stand the more significant it appears
3522278 disse a ele saakashvili que falava em nome de todos os americanos quando comentei com ele hoje que somos todos georgianos

3522287 what do you want to be when you grow up
3522288 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
3522289 do you want to take advice from the man who looked at the batman and robin script and said lets do this
3522290 hey aspiring child actors competing for our hearts and votes on a competitive talent show what could go wrong
3522291 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3522292 it has acted as though home schooling is in fact permitted in california
3522293 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull

3522297 it is a political document it is an agreement of principles and i think we have full coincidence of principles
3522298 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3522299 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement
3522300 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3522301 no matter what they do no matter how much they bomb us no matter how much they cripples us georgia will never surrender
3522302 increased alcohol outcomes among reserve guard personnel deployed with combat exposures is concerning in light of increased reliance on these forces
3522303 active duty marines were also found to be at increased odds of continuing to binge drink after deployment as well as to experience new onset alcohol related problems
3522304 step over here put that cigarette out you dont see the police officer trying to stop you or what or are you just stupid

3522309 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
3522310 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure
3522311 but whats lost here is the discriminatory filter provided by people who have embraced journalism as a craft what has been lost here is the authority such as it ever was of newspaper people trying to do a job well done
3522312 increased alcohol outcomes among reserve guard personnel deployed with combat exposures is concerning in light of increased reliance on these forces
3522313 active duty marines were also found to be at increased odds of continuing to binge drink after deployment as well as to experience new onset alcohol related problems
3522314 women were significantly more likely to start drinking heavily but less likely to start binge drinking or have alcohol related problems compared with men which may be due to women turning to drinking as a whereas men may have a higher propensity for risk taking behaviors
3522315 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3522316 i am not an american i am a new yorker

3522318 our strong second quarter results reflect continued momentum among our diverse set of businesses
3522319 we are encouraged by the robust revenue growth which we achieved despite the backdrop of a challenging economic environment
3522320 in light of our solid first half results and continued positive sales momentum across the company we are confident in confirming our full year revenue and margin outlook
3522321 positive sentiment seen at the end of the first quarter that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived
3522322 in the second half of this year ubs does not expect to see any improvement in the adverse economic and financial market trends that affected this quarters results
3522323 the good news in these results is the break up of the group into three autonomous units because this allows for an eventual sale or part sale of the investment bank
3522324 we think we have reached the trough of the wave on the net new money outflow that would take time to come back to a more normal level
3522325 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3522326 others have led to the creation of excessively elaborate processes and unnecessary layers of complexity
3522327 preparations to name the candidate it still on course but the meeting has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances

3522338 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said

3522340 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3522341 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3522342 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3522343 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3522344 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3522345 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3522346 seharusnya manajemen menghormati hak hak dasar pekerja untuk berserikat malah mendapat rintangan dan tekanan yang luar biasa dari pihak manajemen kami akan adukan ke polisi
3522347 kami bolak balik dikecewakan oleh pembuat kebijakan wanprestasi bahkan kami dihina karena dianggap tidak punya kontribusi pada bank mandiri
3522348 upaya itu dilakukan dengan merancang dan mengedarkan sebuah formulir pengunduran diri kepada setiap karyawan
3522349 sebuah bank plat merah terbesar di negeri ini yang seharusnya menghormati hak hak dasar pekerja untuk berserikat malah mendapat rintangan dan tekanan yang luar biasa dari pihak manajemen
3522350 namun kami tidak ingin bank mandiri dikelola secara tidak profesional amp tidak benar dengan menginjak injak hak hak dasar pekerja

3522358 usia kerja saya 8 tahun tapi gaji saya sama dengan teman teman saya yang berusia baru masuk atau masa percobaan yaitu rp 3 200 000 kami melihat tidak ada keadilan dan jenjang karir yang jelas
3522359 yang seharusnya sistem penilaian itu disosialisasikan ke karyawan tiga bulan sebelum penilaian tapi tidak pernah dilakukan penilaian itu hanya dilakukan 2 3 hari dan itu sudah terjadi bertahun tahun
3522360 kami sudah berharap akan ada kenaikan gaji akan ada bonus yang kami terima untuk menutupi hutang hutang kami karena take home pay kami yang begitu kecil ternyata hal itu hanya isapan jempol belaka
3522361 saya salut kepada rekan rekannya yang dalam keadaan kesulitan ekonomi tapi masih sanggup membikin bank mandiri menjadi kebanggan nasional jerih payah karyawan malah ditekan oleh manajemen
3522362 kami harus memikirkan untuk kesejahteraan karyawannya sikap tidak adil dan tidak baik tadi harus diluruskan oleh karena itu jangan sampai ada anggapan dpr ini kalau terima pengaduan selalu lama karena semua ada prosedurnya
3522363 mohon proses ini bisa disadari tapi kami berharap rekan rekan yang masih bekerja agar tetap bekerja seperti biasa

3522368 we have found there has been increasing interest in d2c portals from our customers it is not surprising looking at the industry over the last few years we have identified the growth of the d2c mobile games mega portal we are now seeing some enterprises running worldwide mobile games content portals aimed at 40 or more countries a handful such as buongiorno lanetro zed news corp jamba jamster and mediaplazza have been steadily building out their portal portfolios and in doing so are reaching into the farthest corners of the world at the same time the leading handset manufacturers nokia n gage samsung fun club and lg mobile are also operating a raft of country specific d2c portals offering mobile games content
3522369 procedural texturing offers many potential technological and artistic benefits yet the process of translating a precise texture from an artists mind into a procedure is difficult to formulate
3522370 the greatest strength of the allegorithmic technology is that it has made fully procedural texturing a viable alternative to hand painting by means of a visual language appealing to artists as well as engineers we have been researching and integrating allegorithmic products into our engine for a few months now and we anticipate that profx and its future developments will remain an important and valuable addition to our core production pipeline and technology
3522371 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3522372 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3522373 this shows the risk of not going with a tried and tested solution

3522403 the olympics reflect the human condition though not in the sunny way we pretend we have inherited from our primate ancestors an inborn evolutionarily learned desire to segregate ourselves into tribes now known as nations and since most of us are too fat and lazy to participate in tribal warfare even of the mimic variety ourselves we have outsourced the job to those few physically spectacular national champions fit enough to enter the ring

3522408 the talks have not collapsed its just a time out
3522409 were going to focus on what weve got to do weve got enough on our plate to bring back the gold medal so we let the people that know best about the situation handle that situation and us do what we do
3522410 i know people want quotes from some of these athletes on these issues but come aug 26 i dont think well be asking those same questions its kind of newsy now i dont have an issue with that at all
3522411 we want to make sure that were good ambassadors for our country and make sure that were representing our game here in the olympics
3522412 i dont want to bring no distractions to our team my number one goal coming here was not to speak on political issues it was to come win a gold medal
3522413 i said if i was asked the question then i would answer and id say that basic human rights should be protected thats how i feel its not going to go further than that its not going to go less than that
3522414 were going to have a lot of the basics on the menu some really nice salads at lunchtime thai chicken salad and shrimp salads

3522441 mortgage referral agents think twice about having consumers accept or buy into predatory loans
3522442 even before the crisis occurred but harrisburg failed to act
3522443 there were some bad mortgage brokers just as there are some bad people in every industry
3522444 becoming a mortgage originator was too easy pay the fee fill out the paperwork and you could start originating loans
3522445 the law is a welcome change that will weed out many of the bad originators
3522446 i think it is about time that licensing has been addressed
3522447 every loan officer should need to comply with certain standards to conduct business
3522448 with the changes in the law the brokers association is changing membership levels
3522449 there will now be brokers and originators with originators paying a reduced fee but have the same services from the association as the broker
3522450 put your pride aside and get help a lot of people are not taking steps needed to avert foreclosure until it is too late its is more difficult to overturn a foreclosure than avert one
3522451 i would like to note that the commissions enforcement efforts can only accomplish so much the first line of defense for potential customers victims to avoid this type of fraud is education and common sense this task force represents a major step toward developing and ensuring the effectiveness of this defense
3522452 oh they brought out tyras wax figure hmmmm thats weird but whatever

3522455 because we russians remember those days when we were quite friendly i vacationed almost every summer on the black sea in georgia theyre great people so friendly
3522456 i hope intelligent russians are against their government and i think most russian americans support the georgians the russian government will always be the same even if its name changes
3522457 we need the whole country to be saved and all georgians to be alive
3522458 we said people are dying we cant sing and dance here
3522459 i still hope that everything is going to be ok

3522461 among adults with vision problems a public health gap exists in actual access to eye care services between canada and the united states primarily owing to the population without health insurance in the united states
3522462 the difference in use of eye care services between americans without health insurance and canadians narrowed when adjusted for income level and was almost eliminated when adjusted for having optional vision insurance
3522463 therefore public health interventions targeting adults with vision problems without health insurance might be more beneficial if they focused on those at risk for serious vision loss especially those in the lowest income group
3522464 overweight children have already been exposed to salty sweet foods and learned to like them

3522467 weve found that having regular doctors who although they dont live in nunavut come back to work on a regular basis has brought some of the advantages of full time doctors and avoided some of the disadvantages of doctors that dont know anything about the place
3522468 the main challenge to having doctors stay here has been the workloads
3522469 thats exacerbated when were short staffed because the work all falls on the shoulders of the people that are left and then youd drive them out because theyre exhausted and then youre even shorter staffed and so the workloads increase so it becomes a vicious circle
3522470 you have to have quite general skills and youve got to have the confidence to use them without constantly having backup
3522471 so its a challenge and quite satisfying when things go well

3522496 it seems that we are hosting an anger management class
3522497 bush wanted to remove saddam through military action justified by the conjunction of terrorism and wmd but the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy
3522498 it seemed clear that bush had made up his mind to take military action even if the timing was not yet decided but the case was thin
3522499 nearly 6 in 10 58 percent said they have doubts about bushs honesty the first time in his presidency that more than half the country has questioned his personal integrity
3522500 one witness law professor jeremy rabkin of george mason university said he was
3522501 you should all remind yourselves that the rest of the country is not necessarily in this same bubble in which people think it is reasonable to describe the president as if he were caligula
3522502 in which he minimizes abuse there and fails to mention extreme punishments and torture we have to wonder if rabkin ever read
3522503 the decision before us is whether to demand accountability for one of the gravest injustices imaginable
3522504 the decision before us is whether congress will stand up to tell future presidents that america has seen the last of these injustices not the first

3522513 i look forward to working hand in hand with the glazer team to help create the greatest wine and spirits distribution company in the united states
3522514 i am thrilled to work alongside mike maxwell who will serve with me as executive vice president and chief operating officer operations and plan on bringing the national scope of our two organizations together we both realize that the key will be local execution for our supplier partners and that part of the organization will be benefited by the focus of bringing the best elements of both companies together this strategic joint venture will create an organization capable of delivering the highest standards of sales operations and service excellence in the industry to each and every critical sales channel we are dedicated to serving on behalf of all our supplier partners we will know we are successful when this transition is seamless to our customer base

3522522 having been born in denmark having had a danish education and holding a job at danish workplace they increasingly form their own opinion that they want to live their own lives and find their own wife if they are then forced to marry someone from rural turkey it is a retrograde step from the way they live and the behavior they have adopted

3522618 we definitely see hactivism taking place from people who have a political ideology and jump on the bandwagon with bots to help promote their opinions and viewpoints whether that be for war or against war or for or against certain countries
3522619 this appears to be more of an intelligence gathering effort rather than a distributed denial of service attack

3522655 increased alcohol outcomes among reserve guard personnel deployed with combat exposures is concerning in light of increased reliance on these forces

3522665 but but what makes you think you know me in that way
3522666 i bet that when it comes to sex its you who has to make all choices take the initiative and do the leading when all you want is not to be in control have it taken away from you and pleased in as many different ways as you could think of to be pushed to be controlled to be needed as much as you need the other person or to even need the other even more willing to do as you are told

3522670 its not just about sexual pleasure although that is part of it neither is it just about pain even though that can be part of it in varying degrees its about the bond of control and trust between two people
3522671 the dom is in control of the sub who puts her trust in him the dom honors that trust and uses his experience to bring out the best in the sub to attain the ultimate sexual satisfaction for them both

3522674 i need to know what would be expected of me
3522675 you would be expected to trust me and say yes to everything i told you to do
3522676 but that is part of the excitement you dont know what i would ask of you and how much of yourself i would expect you to give
3522677 you wouldnt tell anyone else if i came would you

3522758 at a news conference on sunday the deputy national security adviser said we have noted that the russians have introduced two ss 21 medium range ballistic missile launchers into south ossetia now let me say a little footnote about those theyre both conventional and nuclear they have a relatively small conventional warhead however so the military significance if they were to be conventional was almost trivial compared to what the russians could deliver with the aircraft that they were using to strike the georgians

3522769 the gentleman in particular was convinced that if a person was to follow my
3522770 sadly many people believe that if you arent uptight and serious you are doomed to failure in my entire lifetime ive never been more convinced that something is not true
3522771 as you help others succeed even in very small ways it helps you redefine and reflect on your own goals assumptions and ways of doing things if you suggest to someone else for example that they think of education as a lifelong process it might remind you that you havent taken a class in years im often amazed at how my advice applies to my own life and my own success
3522772 atom is off to a very very rapid start far exceeding our expectations when we started the year
3522773 its the perfect recession product to have in the marketplace
3522774 it plays very well in the mobile marketplace it plays in emerging markets it plays into peoples desire to have a second pc or one for the kids thats low cost yet still capable
3522775 well know kind of in six months how much of this demand for atom is real and how much is customers thinking theyre going to win in the market place and double ordering
3522776 it seems to be growing the market rather than cannibalizing existing pc sales
3522777 of course im still comfortable with it its still my forecast
3522778 its not true just in the united states its true in europe in terms of slowing growth that being said what weve seen in the last nine months is our business being pretty normal
3522779 im not giving a forward looking forecast but well continue to use buybacks and dividends to return excess cash to investors

3522781 they now have a product thats designed much more for their market than what theyve had available to them in the past

3522790 there really is no purpose to be served by following humbly in the wake of the genius of mr eugenides why seek to improve on perfection when one knows in advance that one will fail
3522791 i am impressed with the dexterity of mr e linguistic and otherwise
3522792 i rather enjoyed the retort of the blogger known as mr eugenides

3522797 golds failure to hold above 850 and the lack of bullish reaction by traditional safe haven assets such as gold and oil to the clash between russian and georgian forces suggest the need for cash to cover losses in other sectors will continue to outweigh geopolitical tensions in the short term

3522799 the ukrainian side considers this common mission of the heads of democratic european states an important part of the efforts of the international community to maintain and guarantee the territorial unity and sovereignty of independent georgia
3522800 the irresponsible confrontational actions of the current authorities are leading to ukraine being dragged into the conflict between georgia and russia we demand such practices be stopped por condemns any agressive acts directed toward solving regional conflicts by forceful means we call for termination of military action and for the immediate return to peaceful negotiations por appeals to western politicians not to employ dual standards both in the georgian south ossetian russian conflict and in their approach to all other regional problems as one sided support of one or other side creates dangerous precedents we appeal primarily to the ukrainian leadership not to support just one side of the conflict but to conduct a balanced and wise foreign policy in the conflict involving the three sides and to consider the national interests of ukraine

3522813 many of our exhibitors having been exposed to international shows interpack and drupa this year want to bring the information regarding new products and innovations further developments and new fields of business to propak cape so that local companies and those who couldnt attend internationally can also benefit
3522814 this is a further reason for the success of the show as it highlights the latest in packaging trends key to the success in exporting
3522815 its good to see new faces people i have not met before as that is what the exhibitors had come here for
3522816 the show was well organised and well attended it was an ideal opportunity to interact with our target market and good for our exposure in this region

3522819 this has been a mammoth undertaking the likes of which has never been seen before weve needed to find enormous temporary premises because our breweries did not have enough space employ many temporary workers most of whom have been recruited from local communities at each site and handle the kind of transport and site logistics that an army would be proud of
3522820 critics predicted that we would never be able to pull it off but were in the home straight now and it has been fantastically successful
3522821 the 750ml returnable bottle is very important to sabs packaging mix over 80 of beer sold is in returnable bottles of which quarts make up the majority the new returnable quart format is both an environmentally friendly and economically attractive alternative for both our consumers and our customers in trade
3522822 this has been a visionary undertaking in increasing the appeal and relevance of our products and it goes without saying then that project calabash has significant implications for sabs once the coastal operations were converted in 2007 old quart bottles were sent inland for reuse obviating the need for more glass to be fed into the system especially as there was a glass shortage at the time

3522839 we are amazed by how well we have been received since our first event earlier this year
3522840 by celebrities donating their time it really sends a message that they care about the state of our communities their presence will greatly assist us in raising money to provide scholarships to local schools
3522841 we are proud to host an event that showcases an authentic intelligent trend in hip hop
3522842 hip hop has always been about more than bullets and bling and the fact that so many fantastic rappers chessmasters martial artists and graf writers have donated their time to the children is proof of this in itself
3522843 we cannot tolerate a sanctuary for al qaida we will ask more of the pakistani government rather than offer a blank cheque to an undemocratic president
3522844 the greatest threat to security in afghanistan and america lies in the tribal regions of pakistan where terrorists train and plot attacks and then strike and move back across the border
3522845 we need a stronger and sustained partnership between afghanistan pakistan and the nato including necessary assets like satellites and predator drones to secure the border by wiping out terrorist camps and cracking down on cross border insurgents
3522846 hate crime by extremists is met with an agenda of hope
3522847 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3522848 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it
3522849 the children are being punished for even being playful this is not the environment i thought the children would be in when i made the donation
3522850 we have no powers to rescue the children our role is to take care of them after they are rescued by the police however we have deputed an officer to visit the orphanage and give a report
3522851 last friday we received 68 pieces of such rifles from ahmedabad but with abhinav winning gold we have already sold 65 we anticipate a huge interest in the sport in 2007 we sold close to 1 000 rifles this year till july 31 we sold 400 but in the four months from now we are looking at about 2 000
3522852 the phones havent stopped ringing right from dealers to individual buyers the queries are piling up dealers are calling up from punjab haryana himachal pradesh and are demanding rifles in a big way now we have placed bulk orders with an ahmedabad based manufacturing unit to supply us more rifles
3522853 in one day we have sold 10 rifles and received 15 queries it is amazing that even five year old kids accompanied by their parents of course are talking about shooting sale has increased tenfold for us and we have just asked for another 50 air rifles from a kolkata manufacturer
3522854 till now we used to sell 20 guns a month but now i am anticipating to sell at least 50
3522855 we certainly would like to expose our kids to this sport
3522856 every body is talking about abhinav bhaiya and all are giving him money

3522858 the second quarter was a watershed period in meeting azures commitment to commercialization
3522859 production began on our balance tm hybrid electric integrated on the ford e450 chassis and orders and revenue are following customers using the vehicle report that it is meeting or exceeding expectations from both a performance and cost metric the balance tm hybrid electric was designed and built to serve the delivery vehicle market niche and all of our indicators including increased sales and growing interest from potential customers suggest that the market is responding favorably
3522860 on july 18 2007 a barrel of oil cost 75 exactly one year later that same barrel cost 131 as a result americans drove 9 6 billion fewer miles in may 2008 compared to may 2007
3522861 most of our commercial customers dont have the option to simply stop driving instead they need transportation to be more economical without sacrificing any performance or dependability our balance tm hybrid electric is a valid solution offering significant economic advantages over conventionally equipped vehicles the second quarter saw our sales and revenue ramp up begin and with increased attention from fleet managers we expect to continue to grow share in the markets we serve
3522862 the conduct then was in the defendants scope of employment regardless of whether it was unlawful or contrary to the national security of the united states

3522877 we do not believe that an internal provincial police investigation would be seen as fair transparent objective or credible enough to bring all the answers that people are looking for
3522878 we found this meeting very positive and it allowed the families to ask questions which we answered
3522879 we reassured the family that we are taking this investigation seriously this inquiry will be handled with integrity impartiality and with rigour
3522880 were not at the point where we have to meet these people right away
3522881 the advantage of a public inquiry is that it will look for the motives that feed this hatred of the police system
3522882 the other advantage of a public inquiry is that we will be able to analyze the intervention methods of police
3522883 in a lot of ways drug dealers are like roaches we squash one and then another comes in
3522884 he was very elusive we had trouble getting information about him
3522885 we heard him talking about settling the score with guns and muscles and what he was going to do to retaliate
3522886 oftentimes these robberies between drug dealers turn into murder we couldnt allow that to happen

3522899 charge 500 25 000 monthly to monitor postings and squelch negative information or to create positive buzz
3522900 too few people are willing to face even the possibility of the cult like nature of bills political movement
3522901 also with xp and other failures getting pushed into even hospitals the cost is not just economic but actual lives but on just the money side with the us in the situation it is currently in having microsoft vista shoved down everyones throat may be the productivity killer that tips the recession beyond the point of no return

3522904 the cw has no deal with tori spelling to appear on 90210 at this time
3522905 at this time there are no plans for tori to appear in the 90210 spinoff
3522906 why did you go to a country so far away from yours
3522907 i didnt play well in australia the french i shot myself in the foot and at wimbledon i couldnt get it together in the final
3522908 venus played better than i did but i didnt play my best
3522909 i feel like i should be able to win for the most part and sometimes i get disgusted because i didnt make the right shots or made a lot of errors i dont like to lose im a perfectionist and feel like i should be the best at what i do
3522910 i was playing incredible maybe my best set in my life
3522911 but you have to win two sets to beat him he never misses hes like that all the match you have to play so aggressive hes the best player in the world for me and it will be really hard for one player to beat him
3522912 this and the u s open is the last big fight
3522913 its not the end of the world but rafa deserves the credit because first he had to defend his no 2 ranking against djokovic in hamburg since then he has been on a winning streak but if he would have lost that semifinal he would be no 3 in the world which now looks crazy right
3522914 lets put it this way petes sleeping a little better than he was about five months ago
3522915 hes thinking maybe i actually have a chance to hold on to this thing it is not out of the question that 14 are going to be enough its not going to be as easy to just mow through it the way most of us thought
3522916 pete talked about 17 18 and i thought federer was going to get it but you always hit that spot when it starts to get tougher
3522917 when pete hit 14 i thought god whos going to get there and its pretty amazing that roger has gotten so close roger is 27 today and how many did pete win after 27 it doesnt get any easier no one roger pete he had an incredible run too you cant keep it up sooner or later the law of averages catches up
3522918 roger is going to be more relaxed there is less pressure on him i dont say he will come back in one or two weeks but for sure he will get back to no 1 hrbaty said there was huge pressure on him to win wimbledon then to stay no 1 nobody else had to experience that kind of pressure there will be more pressure on rafa now
3522919 hes definitely doing a lot of things better than he was in the past
3522920 i think hes moving better on hard courts and hes changing the pace of the ball a little more and not playing so far behind the baseline hes hitting the ball a bit harder and trying to serve bigger
3522921 our rivalry is great for tennis right now i think weve played each other 16 times and given our ages we will probably play another 20 times
3522922 we are very different characters but it is on the fair play side i think we will leave our mark on the sport
3522923 but this scene the one with don draper redacted an odious she manager into submission sent a message you think this is escapism lifestyle fun entourage with better suits wrong o
3522924 betty is unexpectedly happy like her husband shes just paid her freight by sucking up to the people who pay for her lifestyle and like don she just did so by managing expectations the episode ends with something we rarely get from mad men a scene in which don and betty feel like both a real couple and a real team
3522925 as betty sits in that car at episodes end reflecting on another night of her husband using her as window dressing for a deal or in this case worse bait for the leering of a famous drunk she cant hide from it anymore she plays to don like shes happy to be part of his life but shes crying because she realizes that yes she is profoundly sad and has no idea how to go about improving this state of things
3522926 in truth it has proved a lot more difficult than i anticipated for my family to settle in the area and the club has been very supportive and understanding of my decision
3522927 on occasion i knew they were here by themselves but i also had no way of knowing whether or not and the frequency of adult supervision
3522928 we know nothing of journalism but we know a cash cow when we see it and well milk the old gal for all shes worth and then bleed her dry before we jump ship for new opportunities

3522931 there will be only one tony dorsett and thats why its such an honor that tony took the time to personally pay tribute to leseans accomplishments
3522932 he is one of the greatest running backs to ever play the game
3522933 walking past his retired jersey every day my teammates and i know the high standards he set at pitt
3522934 other than the fact that you dont have 92 telling you exactly what is coming and what to expect there really isnt much difference this year
3522935 it isnt like its a new position for me im a starter now thats it
3522936 im just going to build on what we established last year and continue getting better
3522937 maybe i am baiting some offensive coordinators not to double team me right now
3522938 honestly i am the new guy on the block but i feel i am going to go out there and give whoever tries to block me a long night
3522939 we have everything in already that we are going to throw at people

3522991 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3522992 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3522993 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

3522996 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3522997 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3522998 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3522999 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3523000 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3523001 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3523002 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3523077 there is the abstract present time which is a maximal consistent proposition there are many things that are similar to the abstract present time in being maximal consistent propositions that either will be true are true or have been true each one is a time the abstract present time is the only one of all of these abstract times that happens to be true now

3523115 we believe and social science confirms that the well being of children is best accomplished in the environment of the home nurtured by their mother and father anchored by bonds of marriage
3523116 we further believe that legal recognition and the accompanying benefits afforded couples should be preserved for that unique and special union of one man and one woman which has been historically called marriage
3523117 defenders of the family attack gay marriage as the single most serious threat to the heterosexual institution of marriage this is a boldface lie it would behoove straight men and women to accept personal responsibility in having nearly destroyed heterosexual marriage rather than passing the buck onto gays
3523118 straight men and women have killed off marriage by creating an acceptable culture of male womanizing no fault divorces workaholism that puts professional success ahead of the marital intimacy and by having developed a grossly misogynistic culture that trains exploits and degrades women thereby impeding male respect gays and lesbians constitute at most 15 percent of the general population while heterosexual divorce is at 50 percent so lets stop the canard that gays are a threat to the institution of marriage

3523143 i think its the right time to make the decision
3523144 we need to move on and get one guy the others can look to center john estes is the leader of the offensive line but the quarterback by the nature of the position is the leader of the offense and we need to make a decision we worked hard on our evaluations we need to sit down and call the shot we feel the guy we choose needs more reps its time we get whoever is the best at the quarterback position
3523145 were going to make a decision later this week weve got to move on at the quarterback position wednesday thursday were going to make a decision if not sooner i think its very competitive were on it daily evaluating every snap want to make the right decision the quarterback position is a leadership role weve got people fighting for the role thats an important reason we need to make the decision
3523146 the next couple practices will be big every practice is big but we have to eventually make decisions its still tight thats the thing one guy has a good day now we have to get it consistently but theyre coming the practices are getting faster the tempo is more game like and thats what we need
3523147 take what the defense gives you coach ron and coach rolo have been making emphasis not to get greedy just take what they give you because that will start to open everything else up sometimes were anticipating a certain throw and you cant do that especially in this offense
3523148 the chosen quarterback would start against florida on aug 30 and receive about 75 percent of the reps in team passing drills one player no longer in contention is tyler graunke who has been withheld from team activities while an academic issue remains unsettled graunke had hoped to rejoin the team by yesterday but he was a no show at practice yesterday even if he were to resolve his academic issues he still would need to file paperwork take medical examinations and attend orientation sessions a process that would keep him off the field for another week funaki alexander and rausch have played well as the coaches continue to implement new plays rolovich has charted every pass of every practice he grades each play on a 0 to 5 point system the categories include footwork quality of throws going through progression decision making and even eye contact rolovich then has a comment for every play some expansive some in text message code alexander said one comment read twtdgy
3523149 its very helpful he points out the little mistakes we do any mistakes
3523150 its not all by the numbers theres leadership composure those type of things you cant put a number on the numbers are the numbers but theres also the personality thing thats hard to judge you have to get a feel for that
3523151 its frustrating it sucks it had to be at a time like this i was getting comfortable again its just a game stuff happens
3523152 maybe i got hit wrong or something when i woke up sunday morning it hurt
3523153 i have to look at the plus and not worry about it until then that would be really disappointing if he were hurt badly but we would move on we have the players to move on
3523154 the warriors were without two thirds of what they are trumpeting as the best linebacker group in the western athletic conference rightside linebacker adam leonard did not participate in his third consecutive practice because of tightness in his left hamstring that forced the warriors to activate an experiment that was initiated three days ago middle linebacker solomon elimimian who was voted as the wacs preseason defensive player of the year moved to leonards spot on the right side r j kiesel kauhane who had been practicing on the right side competed at soares position on the left side and backup brashton satele was promoted to no 1 middle linebacker
3523155 we moved solly elimimian outside because brashton has been playing middle so well we didnt want to stack solly and brashton on the depth chart we think brashton is our fourth best linebacker instead of moving brashton outside we were going to rotate four linebackers into three spots instead of moving brashton who is younger and knows the middle and make him learn more it was easier to move solly solly is sharp and he can play middle and outside it doubles his chances of going to the next level
3523156 sollys been our middle for years we catch each other making the same calls
3523157 they settled on an arrangement in which elimimian will continue to make the calls
3523158 whatever the team needs me to do ill do im all about winning if the team wants me to play d tackle ill play d tackle if the team wants me to play free safety im there
3523159 whatever coach needs me to do whatever it is we need to win im ready to do it if i have to play d tackle ill play d tackle being in a game if someone goes down you dont have time to look around you dont have time to ask questions you have to be ready right now guys are getting ready
3523160 i watched adam and blaze so much i kind of know what to do on the outside there are still things im trying to get but coach lee is doing a good job of helping me
3523161 unfortunately blaze got hurt so some of the new guys had to step up things like this happen youve got to be ready hopefully from now on we can stay injury free
3523162 were a wide open offense and we love to run if you cant run theres really not a place for you at the university of florida
3523163 they florida and georgia are like the nfl there is team speed everywhere
3523164 theyve got team speed across the board and nobody that is slow
3523165 everybody can run we were laughing about cornerback joe haden he runs a 4 3 40 yard dash and hes only the seventh fastest player on our team that puts things into perspective for you
3523166 i believe were going to have speed especially at the skill positions on offense i think weve got a 4 2 guy at every position
3523167 to underline just how much speed the gators are blessed with before the spring game it is reported uf put up the offer of a scholarship to any student that could beat rainey in the 40 yard five tried none got their schooling paid for as rainey blazed to a 4 24 then in the game he broke loose on a 65 yard td run
3523168 i won the first race the second one we kind of stopped and then the third race he rainey won
3523169 san jose state never came through i think i made the best choice i could make the man upstairs wanted me to be here so i made the best of it
3523170 they had to remove a scholarship and i guess i was the one
3523171 after reaching out to the warriors they offered him a scholarship last july after adjusting to the programs defensive schemes last season roberts is practicing as the fifth defensive back in both the okie and nickel packages he is also on the second unit at cornerback
3523172 if we go okie once ryan mouton moves inside then calvin goes to the corner so even if he didnt start for us which he still may then he would play in our nickel and okie packages
3523173 i contacted hawaii and we connected it was out of the blue i always liked it i liked my trip over here but san jose was so close and i had my baby so i wanted to stay close but it didnt work out so i just came back here
3523174 i started to know the defense and the players and i adjusted
3523175 he had to learn a new system techniques the verbiage is different we knew he had talent but hes really made that jump
3523176 he really wants to do good i call him the hardest working man in show business because he gets out here and you can hear the breath in his voice the hustle in his talk the sparkle in his eye
3523177 i kept my speed together and got stronger and worked on my lower body
3523178 players like roberts mouton and jameel dowling have a sense of urgency because it is their final collegiate season and they are working to reach their potential miano said
3523179 if theres one two three four on the depth chart then roberts is three and hes not far away from being two ryan mouton is just so much more athletic that hes number one calvin could be the number two guy he and jameel will battle it out and j p davis isnt that far behind at four jeramy bryant has come a long way too
3523180 i might give it a try well see how it goes
3523181 when you get injuries thats what depth is all about any position that loses somebody its unfortunate but you move on
3523182 weve got to get our work in weve got florida in the opener so thats something that motivates us
3523183 today was a hot day there were some guys with some aches and pains and its good to hear keala watson step up like he did today and david veikune step up like he did today that in my opinion is the strength of our team
3523184 i vocalize when i need to but i just lead by example on the field and go hard kealas the one hes the talker out there
3523185 our d line is pretty solid everybody knows what to do everybodys their own leader
3523186 thats why i just have to push harder last year during team periods i didnt get as many reps me and amani would always switch in and out now im getting in there every single play im getting better and my techniques looking better
3523187 hes a great natural pass rusher hes great with his hands run and pass where hes made the most improvement is with his footwork in our line slants and our rush stunts
3523188 its hard for the guys who are injured because they cant get the reps but the guys who are in there we get double the reps itll help us prepare that much better get our reads down a lot of things are coming faster more reaction instead of reading
3523189 josh has really been a superstar this first part of camp
3523190 we just have to be smart with him fales a great player were going to give him the reps he needs but were going to condition him in a smart way
3523191 thats the thing once you start talking about how much depth you have usually the next thing is all of your depth falls off were hoping in the next couple of days to be back to full strength what it does is it gives a bunch of younger guys a chance to go with the first string
3523192 just now i thought about it because our starting center went down and i was like man we got nobody stepping in of course the young guys are doing a really good job but as for me i thought about asking offensive line coach brian smith about it and im going to start snapping some balls today just to help out
3523193 estes and tuioti mariner both practiced yesterday but were held out of contact drills lefiti a redshirt freshman out of mater dei high school in california had his moments in the morning session but ahsoon saw an opportunity to step in and lead his younger teammates
3523194 its a chance for me as a senior to step up and do what i got to do theres a lot of pressure on the young guys reading defenses and theyre learning to trust what they see
3523195 i thought offensively we were a little slow today weve got to pick up our tempo weve got some starters dinged up so young guys are getting some reps so you try to stay on those guys
3523196 the extra work fits perfectly into smiths plan for the season
3523197 the first few days i felt kind of off i wasnt used to feeling my body move a certain way but its been a good week for me i just need to fix my mistakes thats all i can do right now
3523198 im my own worst critic ill tell you right now im doing horrible thats why ive got to keep pushing i dont want to lose my spot
3523199 those are both hard you saw the big guys running at the end theyre running like a mother
3523200 im like aw man puu is going to kick his butt but right when saki came out with those leg kicks and combos i was like no way that guy is fast speed kills
3523201 not me man i use stones to throw at people i dont fight
3523202 i wanted to watch but i ended up just sleeping the whole time

3523205 i beg you to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language dont search for the answers which could not be given you now because you would not be able to live them and the point is to live everything live the questions now perhaps then someday far in the future you will gradually without ever noticing it live your way into the answer

3523210 i know ruud through his years in europe no one knows him in the united states he was a legend i admired him as a player but i do not admire him as a coach the way he conducts himself his lack of ability to communicate with players and his way of developing the team shows a lack of respect

3523214 many experts in foreign policy say that one reason russia responded so forcefully to georgias attempt to take back south ossetia is that the united states and europe had been asserting themselves in russias backyard alienating moscow by supporting kosovos bid for independence

3523235 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3523236 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3523237 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3523238 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
3523239 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3523240 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3523241 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3523242 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3523243 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

3523245 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3523246 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3523247 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3523248 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3523249 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3523250 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3523251 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3523252 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

3523401 todays arrest should send a strong message employers who think they can wait until they get caught before getting workers compensation insurance are in for a rude awakening
3523402 any employer trying to cheat workers and the state by failing to have workers compensation insurance will be held accountable by my office providing protection for workers injured on the job is the law and we all share the cost when employers ignore taking care of their employees

3523405 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3523406 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3523407 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3523408 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3523409 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3523410 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3523411 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3523412 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3523413 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3523414 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3523415 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3523416 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3523417 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3523418 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3523419 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3523420 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3523421 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3523422 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3523429 its notable that suddenly with output rising opec officials are concerned about adherence to quotas and oversupply
3523430 however as we look toward the fourth quarter of the year barring a more significant decline in demand the world is going to need opec oil to avoid a larger inventory draw than is normal for the fourth quarter pulling inventories at that rate would be very bullish for prices
3523431 what is more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose

3523435 wed seen pictures of the guys doing operations drilling and practicing and the equipment they use
3523436 you see one or two guys with turnout gear on and the rest of them just have fatigues
3523437 if you put the word out that there are things that are needed the fire companies usually and always do come through
3523438 its great to see the fire companies support the troops that are over there volunteering themselves
3523439 as we were packing it there was a lot of camaraderie a lot of wishing gary was here with us doing it
3523440 we were taking a lot of pictures and we sent some pictures with them its just a warm fuzzy kind of feeling you know
3523441 this is not their job their job is still their other assignment they do this just in their spare time
3523442 the way i feel its just showing how the volunteer firefighters get together to help each other out

3523465 como si fuese dios en la tierra por qu saben lo que es juzgar a los jueces es algo demasiado importante que debe ser de verdad cumplido a cabalidad como lo ha hecho la comisi n con ponderaci n con prudencia con mucho respeto hacia los jueces con la mayor pulcritud de hacer realmente una loable misi n
3523466 me parece muy importante que la comisi n haya hablado del fuero de atracci n saben por qu porque el sistema de justicia no solamente se compone con los juezas y jueces en el pa s ustedes saben que est n all los fiscales del ministerio p blico los abogados litigantes los defensores p blicos de presos los escabinos

3523476 there has never been a problem with the fire engineers holding a meeting until tonight when a few people were supposed to show up
3523477 the report from the fire marshal has not been completed
3523478 my concern is that there is a problem with that fire department
3523479 i was first on the scene and able to watch if it had it not been for the departments from pease portsmouth and greenland that entire complex would have gone up in flames they sent people who did not know what to do and people that panicked when they got there they never set up a commend center and couldnt get the truck to run so instead of a 2 500 property damage claim the house burned down
3523480 everyone knows what happened of course but i want to push it far enough so it never happens again
3523481 people came with over 40 years of experience between them i dont want them to come to my house and if the chief is in charge of training i dont want him as the chief
3523482 every year they ask for more equipment more men and when they get to the first fire in 10 years they cant put it out
3523483 its a little party house down there and no one does anything about it what if that fire had happened four hours later and people were sleeping there would have been a fatality

3523490 the u s senate is one of our forefathers most brilliant democratic inventions
3523491 to preserve our vibrant democracy for future generations i believe it is critical to have a place where citizens can go to learn first hand about the senates important roles in our system of government
3523492 after a couple meetings i think well be able to pull that off by the end of the year
3523493 and thats not a credit to me thats a credit to his life people are so receptive to doing something in his name after hes done so much to help other people

3523499 collaboration with besang on 3d ic development demonstrates the expert technical capability of nnfc and the commercialization of emerging semiconductor technologies we expect that besangs breakthrough 3d ic technology will provide ultimate low cost and high performance solutions for the semiconductor industry
3523500 i am pleased that besangs 3d ic development is the first success story of excellent collaboration and technology exchange between snf and nnfc
3523501 one of unique features of besangs 3d ic is the capability of unrestricted 3d interconnections using conventional via technologies that does not require wafer alignment nor through silicon vias for 3d interconnects
3523502 conventional cmos technology is facing its scaling limits therefore this emerging 3d ic technology will extend the lifespan of cmos technology because it is an excellent alternative way to accommodate more devices on a given wafer area
3523503 besangs 3d ic is a novel combination of short process steps formation of array blocks in 3d thin layer transfer using unique wafer bonding followed by low temperature processing
3523504 hence there is a high possibility for this breakthrough 3d ic to provide low cost manufacturing solutions for the semiconductor industry besangs 3d ic is a very attractive technology and one wonders why other companies have not thought about it however i always believe in the dynamics of small companies as my colleague dawon kahng and i worked as a small team within a large organization when we co invented the non volatile memory in 1967 at bell labs
3523505 we can imagine evolution of semiconductor technologies through 3d vertical stacking instead of conventional horizontal shrinking which is getting more expensive and facing ever more technical difficulties
3523506 for rapid wafer processing engineers at nnfc and students and staff members at snf reserved the tools for besang with such strong support from nnfc and snf besang has successfully reached this level of technology development in a very short time i would like to say special thanks to all at nnfc and snf

3523587 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3523588 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3523589 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3523590 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3523591 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3523592 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3523593 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

3523598 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3523599 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3523600 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3523601 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3523602 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3523603 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

3523613 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3523614 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3523615 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3523616 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3523617 what we want to do though is refurbish the hubble so that it can operate as long as possible
3523618 were going to add some new instruments and then were going to go in and kind of do internal surgery on some instruments that are already in the telescope
3523619 the whole concept of going somewhere where you dont have a place to shelter like the space station was a little different
3523620 its a very low probability of an event but im glad that theres a relatively robust plan to deal with it if it did happen
3523621 it has answered just so many of those fundamental questions that people have been asking about the cosmos since people were able to ask questions
3523622 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3523623 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3523624 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3523625 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3523626 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3523627 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3523628 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3523633 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3523634 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3523635 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3523636 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3523637 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3523638 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3523639 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3523640 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3523641 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3523642 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

3523652 bonito bien disputado ya que ellos en los partidos tanto de local como de visitante los han perdido entonces van a tener un poco de presi n para trata de conseguir un buen resultado ante su afici n y nosotras seguir por la misma senda tratar sumar de tres o por lo menos el empate
3523653 fue bueno para mi tener un acercamiento con los aficionados ahora intentar dar mi mayor esfuerzo en cada partido que juegue
3523654 el domingo fue incre ble el ambiente en el estadio los aficionados son muy importantes para nosotros porque se viven grandes sensaciones jugar frente a ellos
3523655 ahora el equipo es muy fuerte aunque necesitamos guardar nuestra forma f sica para enfrentar la pr xima semana al middlesbrough y as arrancar de la mejor manera posible la pr xima temporada
3523656 siempre est la ilusi n de jugar cada fin de semana ahora el t cnico pretende hacer cambios y en caso que me toque jugar lo har con muchas ganas a nadie el gusta la banca pero aqu es un equipo donde hay jugadores de mucha trascendencia e importantes y donde cada quien se tiene que ganar un lugar
3523657 fue un gran torneo para m pero eso ya pas y ahora me enfoco en este torneo y ahora hay que buscar los tres puntos ante toluca
3523658 todos debemos de estar comprometidos y sacar el triunfo sabemos que no se han dado los resultados pero esperamos lograr la primera victoria ante toluca
3523659 a carlos s nchez lo recibimos esta ma ana seg n estoy enterado 20 minutos despu s de que comenzara su calentamiento de futbol donde sufri una debilidad s bita del cuerpo de la cara y del brazo en su costado izquierdo
3523660 una resonancia magn tica demuestra que la arteria que irriga la mayor parte del cerebro del lado derecho del hemisferio cerebral derecho cuyo nombre es arteria cerebral media se encontraba tapada por un co gulo y se estaba desarrollando en este momento un infarto cerebral
3523661 el territorio por supuesto es extenso en una situaci n delicada y en este momento precisamente colegas de equipo del hospital m dica sur est n intentando romper ese co gulo la situaci n de carlos en este momento obviamente es delicada es una enfermedad que requiere mucho trabajo aunque en este momento se encuentra estable en el aspecto hemodin mico que quiere decir que su presi n arterial su frecuencia cardiaca y su funci n respiratoria se encuentran bien l est conciente puede hablar porque la lesi n del cerebro no est da ando el rea del lenguaje ni el rea de la comprensi n esperamos poder recanalizar esta arteria en principio no tenemos la certeza absoluta porque es un co gulo grande y hay ciertos l mites en los que podemos actuar
3523662 va a estar l en una unidad de cuidados intensivos son muchos los detalles que va a haber que cuidar en la terapia intensiva pero son cuidados que se van a hacer de manera muy meticulosa y vamos a esperar a las pr ximas 48 72 horas que es el tiempo de m s riesgo para este tipo de enfermedades
3523663 es una pregunta dif cil de decir en este momento yo les suplicar a paciencia seguramente la gente de prensa del equipo les estar informando pero estamos en otra etapa ahorita estamos en la etapa de tratar de rescatar la mayor cantidad de cerebro y no podemos hacer en este momento un conteo de da os sobre todo que se nos vienen dos o tres d as complicados
3523664 lo mejor es no hacer ruido e ir poco a poco
3523665 este es un a o en el que la exigencia ser muy alta y lo sabemos pero creo que lo que debemos hacer es tener la misma humildad y el trabajo del a o pasado lo mejor es no hacer ruido e ir poco a poco si no hacemos ruido nos ir mucho mejor
3523666 para los que hemos llegado un poco m s tarde esta mini pretemporada nos viene muy bien ya que puede que no estemos al nivel que tienen algunos de nuestros compa eros pero la verdad es que creo que nos falta muy poco y que con un poco m s llegaremos sin problemas para afrontar el inicio del campeonato
3523667 a la gente nueva los veo bien y muy adaptados es algo que tambi n esperaba ya que adem s de ser jugadores de calidad conocen muy bien nuestro futbol y eso les har las cosas m s f ciles

3523682 no company no matter how well managed can avoid being impacted by weaknesses in its core business
3523683 if the company is forced by regulators to bring these 3 billion in auction rate securities on its book we estimate it might have to write down roughly 350 million in auction rate securities losses
3523684 what is more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose
3523685 would force firms to spend money to automate their systems and would add costs to both brokers and customers in the form of increased borrowers fees

3523694 i am determined to make the management of ubs more effective
3523695 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3523696 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation

3523706 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3523707 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3523708 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored

3523710 your cv lists skills in both c asp net and java how does that work
3523711 i specialise in software development and therefore use whichever technology is most appropriate for the software being written or fits better into the overall technology strategy of the company it so happens that in my recent jobs the companies had applications written in both java and net and i had to work with both technologies in fact i am employed as a c developer but am asked to do java work also because i am the only developer with that versatility in the previous job it was the reverse i was officially a java developer but i ended up doing quite a lot of c development to help the team meet deadlines i even had to brush up my c skills to write setup utilities at the last minute in fact i would consider it a strength to have knowledge and practical experience of both technologies as for which one i would prefer to work with i actually dont have any preference java pays more and net development is a bit more exciting at the moment so send me job descriptions of any vacancies that you have and i will see if they appeal to me

3523727 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
3523728 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
3523729 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
3523730 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
3523731 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
3523732 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
3523733 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
3523734 this is not how we explain chemistry to high school students
3523735 heres a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem but because the findings are so fundamental it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds

3523738 industry financial and market conditions for our industry remain challenging however our management team continues to execute our strategic plan which focuses on growing our franchise during our just completed fiscal year the growth in the number of new households increased 145 0 over fiscal year 2007 during the same timeframe the number of checking accounts increased by 2 349 or 12 2 in addition to this growth the number of consumer loans originated increased 88 0 over the past fiscal year the company also opened branches in jordan creek and ankeny iowa the number of customers that use our online banking service has increased over the last fiscal year which we believe will lower our overhead costs in the long run we believe these growth trends will continue as the new branches mature and we continue to promote our companys brand and image the company also has had successes in the commercial banking area commercial core deposit balances have increased 15 3 the number of customers using cash management products increased 102 7 penetration of the companys business remote deposit product fred increased 112 5 and the number of commercial internet banking users increased 27 4 finally the company recently rolled out a small business banking initiative we believe these as well as other new initiatives planned for the 2009 fiscal year will assist in growing the franchise and will lead to a return to profitability as industry conditions improve

3523748 these results are the first to prospectively quantify changes in alcohol use in relation to recent combat deployments interventions should focus on at risk groups including reserve guard personnel younger individuals and those with previous or existing mental health disorders further prospective analyses using data from this study group will evaluate timing duration and co existing illnesses of alcohol misuse and other alcohol related problems better defining the long term effect of military combat deployments on these important health outcomes
3523749 there is potential that this continuing research will have huge clinical implications
3523750 if we can define the mechanism for recovery the translation of these findings to the clinic will dictate how much massage is needed for how long and when it should be performed after exercise
3523751 we tried to mimic swedish massage because anecdotally its the most popular technique used by athletes
3523752 a review of the research in this area shows that despite the existing anecdotal evidence we know athletes use massage all the time researchers dont know the mechanism of how massage improves recovery after exercise and injury
3523753 its hard to describe exactly how the exercise intensity would be matched in a human but this was considered a significant amount of exercise that would likely cause muscle soreness and possible damage
3523754 we know biological tissues are sensitive to the magnitude of frequency duration and load so we controlled the force frequency and time spent on massage
3523755 one fundamental question is how much of a role does inflammation play in repair to a muscle are we preventing inflammation and therefore improving recovery we havent proven that yet
3523756 our goal is to use this model to understand the biological mechanisms of massage as a guide to preclinical trials to test the effects of massage on muscle recovery after exercise
3523757 a trial in humans could look at optimal indications for massage

3523776 normal life is likely to face wider social and economic disruption significant threats to the continuity of essential services lower production levels shortages and distribution difficulties
3523777 this should be sufficient to treat all those who fall ill in a pandemic of similar proportions to those that occurred in the 20th century

3523785 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors

3523849 how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries besides the fanatical frenzy which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog there is this fearful fatalistic apathy the effects are apparent in many countries improvident habits slovenly systems of agriculture sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live a degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement the next of its dignity and sanctity the fact that in mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property either as a child a wife or a concubine must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased to be a great power among men individual moslems may show splendid qualities but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it no stronger retrograde force exists in the world far from being moribund mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith it has already spread throughout central africa raising fearless warriors at every step and were it not that christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science the science against which it had vainly struggled the civilization of modern europe might fall as fell the civilization of ancient rome

3523879 we are talking about the apples and the pears if you have a pear shaped body your obesity is around your hips or so its a much lesser risk for heart attacks and strokes than when you are apple shaped that means fat is around the waist
3523880 it doesnt mean that if your cardiovascular risk factors are now normal you are overweight that you are perfectly fine youre still overweight you still should reduce your weight

3523912 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3523913 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3523914 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3523915 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3523916 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates

3524029 i saw a lot of him when i was manager of derby and he was at nottingham forest so i asked him if he wanted to come and he was very positive from the start
3524030 he transferred to derby in the summer and i had him watched i think he will give us a different dimension he is a boy with a lot of ability a naturally left sided winger and maybe we have lacked width in the squad hes matured and has quality
3524031 there wont be huge changes from this squad for the one which we will use against macedonia in our first qualifier
3524032 we hope alan hutton will be available but the nucleus of the squad for this game will be the same for macedonia

3524223 i wonder whether the obama camp is making a mistake by putting the candidate in front of 75 000 people for his nomination acceptance speech on aug 28 that spectacle will further inspire obamas current supporters but the clever rove alumni in the mccain camp may well use that imagery to refine their caricature of obama as a pop celebrity and little more to take his alleged strength as a candidate and spin it as a weakness will that work just remember the votes of the credulous count the same as everybody elses
3524224 their largest organizing opportunity to date with credentials going in part to obama supporters and democratic activists who pledge to join voter registration and get out the vote drives in the campaigns final weeks

3524232 rather than being explained by a single factor an accumulation throughout life of many associated cultural personal and economic exposures is likely to underlie the risks for obesity and some elements of associated neurological function
3524233 it appears to be consistent with the indications that witnesses or proposed witnesses had given us when the clerks office had called around to them to determine their availability and willingness to appear
3524234 i have reviewed the list with the clerk with the various responses of the proposed witnesses there are three that i can see that specifically indicated that they were not going to attend that they were told not to attend

3524243 great points well presented i agree with you i did a post on october 12th that presented five

3524245 i too would prefer to hear from practioners and peers whether in person or remote if the
3524246 its one thing to line up in a stance and theres no one chasing you and just run around when you put the pads on and youre going against people thats when you really find out what guys can do
3524247 but theres very few times that you ever see him get run by so thats another element that you saw on tape 40 time versus playing speed was very different
3524248 he knows when the receiver enters into the end zone now you dont want to be even with the receiver you want to slide underneath him because you have the sideline and you have the back of the end zone as your help
3524249 he did a nice job transitioning sliding and then playing the ball that was a lot of the stuff that we saw in college the instincts
3524250 when you make plays especially as a young guy you just get more confidence from it
3524251 hes been a guy who has been around for a long time and he knows little tricks its almost a surreal feeling as a young guy going against him in practice its going to prepare you for the games
3524252 i stay focused on my highest priorities and dont worry about what isnt getting done since its not my highest priority
3524253 i relieve my stress by exercising every morning i also make sure my assistant schedules me in a hotel with an excellent fitness center when im on the road i stayed at a westin last week that had a treadmill in the room
3524254 spending time with my family including weekends at our second home on the lake helps me unwind its good to be in a different environment away from the everyday hustle and bustle

3524257 huh i see youre doing a line of foaming cleansers five years ago we were trained to laugh at anyone who said they used a foaming cleanser what changed
3524258 there will be a great atmosphere but we hope that the game will turn out well for us
3524259 we are aware that we are going to face a difficult team but we must focus on ourselves we have to plan read the game well and impose our play on the match
3524260 we have a cup final straight away which can decide the whole season and we have got to beat atletico
3524261 the home factor has to be fundamental we must please our fans and win
3524262 i am anxious to see the reception our opponents must feel how difficult it is to play here we are all together and must pull in the same direction
3524263 in the two matches against arsenal we are not just an underdog we are a very big underdog nobody will expect fc twente to beat arsenal
3524264 on the other side all the ingredients are there for a big shock we have nothing to lose
3524265 but they are in a championship in which they have already played 17 games we have to deal with that
3524266 they certainly arent a european heavyweight but we must go into these games with application desire and a strong will
3524267 its not that things are looking better for the us its things are just looking bad elsewhere
3524268 geopolitical concerns always provide good support to oil prices and this news should offer some relief to investors worried about exports of azeri crude from ports in georgia
3524269 the strong recovery in the dollar adds more pressure to the sector which is already suffering from fears over slowing global growth
3524270 while not ready to call an end to this years bull market especially considering the murky outlook for chinese energy demand and continuing weather and geopolitical risks the agencys assessment of increased supply and inventories from june to july provides some fundamental justification for the sharp fall in benchmark crude prices in july

3524278 we need leaders in austin who are going to stand up for fair taxes and quality education rather than a karl rove style partisan agenda
3524279 john davis should tell karl rove to testify before congress and come clean with the american people
3524280 no government employee is above the american people it is time for karl rove to tell the truth and be held accountable for his actions
3524281 until that happens john davis should immediately cancel the fundraiser with rove and return any money raised
3524282 i like to play sports so i dont get fs i put school before football
3524283 i know kids wouldnt be good in school so it works
3524284 there were too many loopholes you could have two fs and then have as to balance it out and still play then we couldnt track kids and some werent on track to graduate
3524285 they have to be students first there is a concern this could force some star players out of the system
3524286 incremental growth and graduation rate is not the answer for our city and our state
3524287 weve got to radically change high schools a 48 graduation rate although it is an increase is nothing yet to celebrate
3524288 weve got a lot of work to do to move kids to proficiency we still have more than 52 of our kids not finishing four years some are finishing in 5 and 6 years our drop out rate is too high

3524322 under the circumstances i believe that this adjustment while well intentioned is unaffordable to the commonwealths retirement system
3524323 i was very much in favor of limiting it to 40 000 and under because those are the people youre trying to help
3524324 i am disappointed frustrated and angered by the governors action
3524325 our retirees deserve respect and a fair cost of living increase and the governor has denied them those things
3524326 i think that took some real political courage i think it was fiscally irresponsible to fund an enhanced benefit when we cant pay for our current benefit
3524327 the governor was obviously under pressure to sign it so i congratulate him on taking a difficult but principled stance

3524359 can you tell me with certainty that boeing is staying in this competition
3524360 any decision of boeings path forward one way or the other would be premature and further speculation would be counterproductive we remain committed to providing the air force with the next generation tanker that meets real world mission requirements and is selected through a fair open and unbiased competition following a realistic timetable
3524361 my guess is that boeing is using that as a negotiation strategy to try and get the department of defense to say they would like the 767 which is the smaller and less capable older airplane
3524362 the boeing tanker team met with dod officials to discuss our comments on the draft rfp and gain further clarity in how the requirements and evaluation criteria have changed since the initial competition we hope that it was just the beginning of a continuing dialogue as we move toward a final rfp that prescribes the right aircraft and gives appropriate weight to all of the capabilities that will be required for the evolving mission over the next several decades
3524363 todays meeting was a productive review of the draft amendment and the process that will be undertaken going forward
3524364 it is clear that the defense department met the concerns raised by the government accountability office and the draft amendment to the kc x tanker request for proposals addresses those concerns by clarifying but not altering the tanker requirements and specifications
3524365 it is also clear that the department recognizes the need to begin production on the next generation of aerial refueling tankers as quickly as possible with the current fleet approaching the half century mark in age our men and women in uniform should not be asked to wait any longer
3524366 we look forward to submitting our proposal within the timeline established by the defense department
3524367 hey why not get a house sized cellphone instead of a small cellphone they do the same thing

3524371 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3524372 its great to be honored alongside these three other inductees because i watched and idolized them when they played
3524373 i watched all three in college and i remember mike and brian playing with my brother tony granato on the 1988 olympic team in calgary its also very special to be the first woman inducted
3524374 i remember watching the 88 olympics in calgary and telling my mom that one day i wanted to be an olympian and play womens hockey
3524375 at the time playing college hockey and getting a scholarship were most important but the possibility of someday playing in the olympics was something i really hoped for fortunately three years before my senior year at providence 1992 93 i discovered my dream of playing for the national team
3524376 the excitement and energy looking around at each other when we were all in the prime of our careers watching mike stand on his head and hully prove he was not only an exceptional goal scorer but great passer
3524377 it was just the most talented team ive ever been around
3524378 it was just awesome to be a part of that group and winning that gold with such a close knit bunch made it that much more special
3524379 that 96 world cup team was one of my greatest moments
3524380 i remember standing on the blue line with chris chelios and thinking what am i supposed to do it was a great feeling to be a part of that championship team
3524381 through usa hockey i learned how to properly represent the team you were playing for
3524382 ill always remember our battles against team canada and knowing how hard we had to work while wearing the usa jersey it wasnt only about playing your best but learning how to grow up and embrace the opportunity
3524383 the evolution of usa hockey has been great to watch
3524384 the expectations within the locker room have changed but the one constant is the fact so long as you have confidence as a group you could achieve anything i really enjoyed the coaches and players and i always took things very seriously because i wanted to develop and help our team win every tournament
3524385 i think maybe its because i never felt i was prepared enough
3524386 growing up in philadelphia i realized real quick that those kids across canada and boston had more rinks and played in more games so they had more access to scouts but usa hockey was extremely helpful in that regard providing me a good training regimen the entire year i was honing everything from my equipment to the way i approached the game i learned real quick that preparation ultimately determined how well i played
3524387 usa hockey always showed faith in me so the decision to play for the united states was never a difficult one
3524388 they saw potential gave me an opportunity to play and find out who brett hull was as a player once given that chance i discovered who i was and played the game the only way i knew how i still remember the booing directed at me at the 96 world cup of hockey when we defeated team canada but they only started booing when they realized we were a threat to win and that was a great feeling
3524389 through usa hockey i learned how to properly represent the team you were playing for ill always remember our battles against team canada and knowing how hard we had to work while wearing the usa jersey it wasnt only about playing your best but learning how to grow up and embrace the opportunity
3524390 i always tell our players to look at things realistically knowing one day all the good things will come to an end
3524391 i tell our kids to grasp each moment and not take anything for granted i know what i did and i cherished every moment in the nhl and on team usa ill never look back and not miss playing because when i look back on those memories it puts a smile on my face

3524397 regular laws of peaceful times do not apply we are at war
3524398 russia doesnt have its own cnn and this is felt really badly the governments objective for the next few years should be to create a powerful propaganda machine and train thousands of highly qualified and ideologically faithful journalists this task is as important as the production of new nuclear war heads
3524399 people of the world you deceive world mass media conduct propagation of a false information
3524400 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3524401 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay

3524415 oh no well in college once but this is a way that ive used to relieve pain whether physical or emotional since i was a child
3524416 i think there are some wounds there and i dont know that health practitioners really understand that
3524417 as a whole community how do we value older people how do we see older people as sexual because theyre often not considered to be sexual so therefore theyre not considered to be sexually diverse so how are we respectful to older glbti people
3524418 it would be a surprise for people to know i was gay disappointed would be a better word they would be disappointed they would think less of me

3524428 a bunch of youth groups posted something that was almost a manifesto that called on supporter to wage an information war against georgia
3524429 in the ongoing russian versus georgia cyberwar we have an indication of lists of georgian governmental sites actively distributed across russian web forums
3524430 by posting on blogs and forums instructions that essentially say this is what were going to do but we dont know whos behind that
3524431 georgian hackers or pro georgian hackers launched distributed denial of service attacks against ria novosti
3524432 especially in russia every time something happens there are attacks name any crisis there in the past year and i can point to a spike in attack traffic
3524433 countries visionary enough in the long term sort of tolerate hacking activities unless of course they target the countrys infrastructure in order for the country to later on mobilize them based on nationalist sentiments
3524434 what the attackers learned is that security researchers are actively monitoring their conversations and so in the russo georgia campaign the conversation wasnt happening at the usual underground corners but rather on mainstream forums
3524435 theyve also learned how to better utilise the masses to participate in the attack and that combination of tactics would improve the quality of the campaign
3524436 anyone picking a political fight with russia today can now expect to deal with multiple forms and sources of electronic attack not only from the russian military but also from the russian governments unofficial civilian hacker assets
3524437 a cyberwarfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites including that of the ministry of foreign affairs
3524438 need resolution immediately i dumped exchange for google apps please dont disappoint me

3524443 the attackers have inserted a large image made up of several smaller side by side images of pictures of both the georgian president and adolf hitler

3524476 i looked in her eyes and realized she was looking at the cockpit i positioned myself in front of the cockpit
3524477 i still was trying to understand what was going on because it happened so quick my main concern was i wasnt going to let this lady in the cockpit
3524478 can you look into my eyes and tell me where i am going to go
3524479 i asked her to calm down when she came to me she was very upset she was shaking her sunglasses in my face
3524480 i asked her what could i do for you i did everything i thought i could do in that situation
3524481 how in the world can that happen the answer is you dont know
3524482 i want her to admit she did something wrong i think people need to be held accountable for their actions

3524486 our morale is much better and i think were getting our fighting game back on
3524487 this is how sieg heil got started and no im not saying obama is hitler i just think people should be careful about slipping into a personality cult for a charismatic leader
3524488 our symbol o is about much more than barack obama
3524489 this election is about sen barack obama not that senator mccain is not an important figure but senator obama is either going to win or lose because americans are going to decide that he can sit in the oval office and that hes able to do it and clearly a myriad of polls are showing that americans are skeptical
3524490 the progression has to be manifested in a new direction in policies and legislation
3524491 im hoping that he is able to make a dent in that direction with the office of the presidency
3524492 attorney general mukasey gave a wonderful opening prayer that really struck the president and bush noted that a number of cabinet members over the years have opened these meetings with strong words of faith
3524493 our goal is to see a crowd of 75 000 people at obamas nomination speech holding their hands above their heads fingers laced together in support of a new direction for this country a renewed hope and acceptance of responsibility for our future
3524494 we thought lets try and start a movement where even while walking down the street people would hold up the o and you would know that they were for obama
3524495 you interlace your hands in a circle the interlacing being a symbol of different types of people coming together and the circle a symbol of unity
3524496 people who have fought the civil rights battle economically politically legally as we have since the 50s would often talk about look what would happen if we have an african american president or chairmens or chairpersons of major congressional committees it doesnt look like its going to be what we all thought it was going to be
3524497 there would be a real crackdown on economic exploitation in the ghettos and poor rural areas the poor pay more they die more earlier healthcare et cetera and african americans with seniority or in positions of power we thought would really pay attention to that
3524498 virtually every part of the capital markets business is suffering at the present time
3524499 no company no matter how well managed can avoid being impacted by weaknesses in its core business

3524501 i was in samarra when the golden mosque was blown up that triggered a lot of the sectarian violence around the country so that will always be frozen in my mind
3524502 ive walked around in a number of patrols in a baseball cap the last couple of days just meeting with civilians iraqis on the street corner who are telling me that this is the safest it has ever been since 2003
3524503 its evidenced by the fact that were walking around markets that we never would have thought we would walk around let alone not wear a helmet
3524504 would not be in the best interest of the community
3524505 the operation that the reinforced russian peacekeeping contingent carried out has been completed because the goal that we set ourselves has been achieved
3524506 the aggressor has been punished and its armed forces have been disorganized
3524507 we have no other choice because no other country came to our aid
3524508 i dont think moscow will be in the mood not only to hold talks but even to speak to saakashvili
3524509 he has committed crimes against our citizens our position is that mr saakashvili can no longer be our partner hed better quit
3524510 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire
3524511 russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3524512 we learned that large scale is fine but keep it local
3524513 the ddc will offer an important niche in the metro tourism area
3524514 at the end it sounds like this will come down to money
3524515 geographic reach has become a more important thing for us
3524516 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3524517 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3524518 we will be back next season we love being here
3524519 although attendance was down at the chevrolet centre we saw more fan interest and involvement than last year and more appreciation
3524520 that very last game is an example and i was taken aback by how many fans tried to seek me out and thank me for a great season

3524522 we have had four brilliant months in worcester where my colleague ross lawford and the rest of us at the rspb have endured the same emotional rollercoaster of excitement and grief as thousands of local people over the changing fortunes of the peregrine family
3524523 however we know that peregrines and other birds of prey fall victim to human persecution all too often and we encourage everybody who cares about these birds to help us stamp out the illegal persecution of birds of prey by signing our online campaign pledge on rspb org uk
3524524 this has indeed been an exciting summer and we hope the adult peregrines will choose to breed in worcester next year
3524525 meanwhile we appeal to local businesses and individuals to help sponsor the project in terms of a new camera and other equipment to give us sharper pictures which will hopefully lead to an even better experience for everybody who wishes to follow the lives of worcesters wild peregrines during the breeding season

3524579 but what about john mccain at this point as governor kaine said obamas running positive ads and john mccain is running ads about paris hilton and that sort of thing what he called the same old karl rove ads can you get elected president that way
3524580 i would make the argument that part of the reason why senator obama is in the shape he is in today is because hes failed to run a positive campaign hes run a negative campaign
3524581 what do you think john mccain ought to do i want to get back to my question
3524582 democrats are worried that barack obamas not doing better that he ought to be doing better than he is
3524583 well i think you ought to point out that only 24 percent of democrats were similarly that had that same degree of enthusiastic enthusiasm for obama
3524584 well actually in our poll it was much greater than that
3524585 does he need to separate himself from your old boss george bush separate himself more
3524586 you have said yourself in the past that obama probably should pick a red state governor somebody just like tim kaine that we just heard just a minute ago from virginia governor kaine seems to think that democrats really can carry virginia this time do you think that states going to be in play
3524587 yeah i think its going to be in play but let me clarify i didnt say that i thought he ought to i said that i thought he probably would pick a red state democrat because i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
3524588 do you think and we have about 30 seconds left here do you think that the democrats do have a good chance of carrying virginia which they havent done since lyndon johnson in 64
3524589 what do you think john mccain ought to do i want to get back to my question can you get elected when the thrust of your campaign seems to be comparing the other guy to sort of an empty suit paris hilton type celebrity doesnt it have to go beyond that
3524590 at least 4 times and is one of the most negative ads ive seen
3524591 all we need to do now is to stop suffering stop the death of people
3524592 there are bigger problems relating to south ossetia that we cannot resolve here
3524593 territorial integrity can be demonstrated by the actual facts on the ground
3524594 i think that these are some very good principles in order to resolve the problem which has arisen from this very dramatic situation and these principles can be used by georgia and south ossetia
3524595 if russia had a different option of reacting to georgias aggression against south ossetia we would have used it
3524596 but we didnt have this option when several thousand civilians are killed the state must act accordingly
3524597 i wanted to make very clear that the united states stands for the territorial integrity of georgia for the sovereignty of georgia that we support its democratically elected government and people and are reviewing options for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to georgia but the most important thing right now is that these military operations need to stop
3524598 having the opportunities for jobs such as the banking industry is important
3524599 wanting to move and buy property the cost of that would be the only thing i would like to see different
3524600 we know when it comes to transportation we run the risk of not keeping up with growth we know in public education charlotte mecklenburg schools compete very favorably with other large systems around the country but thats not good enough we need to be able to compete with any system anywhere

3524606 georgia should refrain from using force in south ossetia and abkhazia and a political settlement must be reached that addresses the status of these disputed regions
3524607 natos decision to withhold a membership action plan for georgia might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia and i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
3524608 i have consistently called for deepening relations between georgia and trans atlantic institutions including a membership action plan for nato and we must continue to press for that deeper relationship

3524619 the record industry argues if intellectual property isnt protected there will be no innovation but tecnobrega has shown thats not true
3524620 piracy in brazil is undermining the ability of the music and film industries to invest in the next generation of local talent lower revenues from current sales mean less money to invest in new artists

3524633 as a community we simply do not need the bad profile associated with this kind of incident because it diminishes the reputation of a place that is home to over 80 000 people the vast majority of whom are good law abiding folk

3524658 we got our first real practice in today the rain hit us about one third of the way through practice and really drenched us but that was good we got some good work we found out we cant handle the ball in the rain we must have fumbled six seven eight times and thats due to the wet weather that shows you why you need to work in it every now and then because you might end up playing in it we were very fortunate that there was not lightning i looked at the clouds like they were expecting lighting but we never got the warning from the weather bureau thank goodness we were able to get in a full practice which is very important because we cant afford to miss any outside practices

3524670 main threat to growth has shifted from the slowdown in the united states to inflationary pressures and the efforts by the regions governments and central banks to tackle them
3524671 while the outlook has become somewhat more pessimistic growth momentum will keep the region growing at respectable rates
3524672 with countries allowing domestic fuel prices to increase even partially there is little question that as long as oil prices remain at current levels or even decline moderately the price adjustments will keep up the pressure on inflation rates
3524673 despite growth slowing down in the second quarter inflation controlling measures continue
3524674 in 133 bc tiberius sempronius gracchus the plebeian tribune passed a series of laws attempting to reform the agrarian land laws the laws limited the amount of public land one person could control reclaimed public lands held in excess of this and attempted to redistribute the land for a small rent to farmers now living in the cities

3524681 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3524682 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3524745 t here is no denying that putting employers to the work of persuading factfinders that their choices are reasonable makes it harder and costlier to defend than if the employers merely bore the burden of production nor do we doubt that this will sometimes affect the way employers do business with their employees

3524760 para la semana que viene ya tendremos definido cu les ser n las empresas que participar n y por ahora pensamos que el lugar m s oportuno para la realizaci n del evento es la avenida irigoyen donde se efect an los corsos com nmente as es que tenemos previsto que se desarrolle all en la segunda semana de octubre
3524761 es una iniciativa que hemos presentado en el concejo deliberante hace algunas semanas y sobre el cual estamos avanzando en estos ltimos d as con algunos ediles y tambi n trasladamos la intenci n al mbito del ministerio de gobierno ya que ayer lunes tuvimos una reuni n con el ministro jorge franco
3524762 en realidad no solamente se limit la charla al tema de las c maras sino que fue uno de los temas tratados l vio con agrado el tema de las c maras nos manifest que pueden surgir inconvenientes t cnicos en la instalaci n implementaci n y el lugar donde van a estar las c maras nos dijo tambi n que est n por licitar el servicio del 911 que es el sistema de emergencias policiales en otras localidades y que se va a instalar ac en la provincia y lo de las c maras podr an ir enganchadas al 911 donde va a estar el centro de control podr a estar el centro de operaciones del control de las c maras
3524763 tambi n se habl el tema de la nocturnidad el control y la seguridad vial el ministro franco est muy preocupado en ese aspecto y creo que esto de las c maras tambi n sirve para prevenci n de la seguridad vial
3524764 este tema del problema de la nocturnidad los j venes la violencia el alcohol o el descontrol siempre va a existir obviamente hay un antes y un despu s al problema se lo trataba muy por abajo y con muchos padres preocupados pas a ser una cuesti n mas atendida por el estado y se han hecho cosas muy importantes el c digo de nocturnidad la concientizaci n que hay en la sociedad de que los j venes no tienen que tomar alcohol ni que los menores ingresen a los boliches es un avance y todo eso ya est instaurado en la sociedad ahora que trabajar en pol ticas y acciones concretas para ir solucionando las cosas hay veces que hay hechos que ponen a la luz algunas deficiencias del sistema y sobre eso hay que trabajar
3524765 las c maras no est n pensadas solamente para el centro sino para lugares cr ticos donde hay mucho tr nsito y en lugares que se sepa por estad sticas que hay m s inconvenientes y se tendr que decidir d nde se van a ubicar estrat gicamente las c maras esto va a tener un proceso que no es f cil hay que configurar todo el sistema que todos trabajen arm nicamente por eso nos explicaba el ministro franco que con el sistema del 911 no es como una l nea 0800 que atienden del otro lado a ver que sucede sino que es la implementaci n de un mont n de servicios que est n ligados al 911 para acudir ante una emergencia lo mismo va a ocurrir con las c maras tambi n es probable que la instalaci n de las c maras sea en forma progresiva poner una c mara como funciona como anda el sistema y despu s ir avanzando esto no tiene un l mite se puede poner una c mara en cualquier lugar
3524766 no se si a este nivel se han instalado c maras en otras ciudades en salta en mar del plata y en buenos aires est n funcionando es un sistema que se lo puede utilizar de distintas formas para prevenir controlar y nosotros le incorporamos la idea de que cualquier vecino pueda acceder por internet para ver que pasa en bol var y col n por ejemplo
3524767 el tema estudiantina nos preocupa de hecho hemos trabajado mucho en ello padres unidos ha implementado ya desde hace cinco a os que no se tome alcohol en la fiesta esa lucha ha tenido el apoyo de las autoridades y eso es lo que buscamos el cambio de h bito para mejorar pero hay otros temas en los cuales hay que trabajar y por ah ya salen del mbito nuestro y le corresponde al mbito municipal o escolar que es porqu a la estudiantina no se le da otra visi n de hacerla m s did ctica que los chicos puedan utilizar esa energ a en aprender a tocar instrumentos musicales que las chicas se hagan la ropa que hagan olimp adas de matem tica competencias deportivas y que la sumatoria de todas estas actividades llegue a un premio entonces participan todas las escuelas y ya hay iniciativas al respecto

3524775 measures to revive the dormant housing market by increasing the supply of mortgage lending are being planned by ministers the times has learnt alistair darling is poised to intervene to help banks and building societies to secure more finance to grant new mortgages the likely move comes after the virtual drying up last year of the mortgage backed securities market which had become a crucial source of mortgage lending
3524776 what is more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose
3524777 would force firms to spend money to automate their systems and would add costs to both brokers and customers in the form of increased borrowers fees

3524780 because the circumstances around the sec emergency order were so unusual im not sure we can gather any real lessons from trading activity during this period

3524786 i am determined to make the management of ubs more effective
3524787 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3524788 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3524789 these candidates bring specific and relevant experience to ubs namely in global financial services the fields of change management and regulation and the perspectives of institutional shareholders

3525045 it is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream when you have something like a nightmare you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream it is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this

3525051 the injury luke suffered is not all that uncommon for golfers and baseball players and im confident he will make a full recovery with the proper rehabilitation and training
3525052 while there is never a good time for an injury the timing of this injury was especially disappointing for me considering that it forced me to miss the open championship and it comes in a ryder cup year
3525053 but taking proper care of it is my highest priority and im encouraged by dr weilands experience with this type of injury and his outlook towards my recovery and rehabilitation
3525054 i am appreciative of his guidance as well as his staffs and look forward to working diligently at my rehabilitation and returning to action next season
3525055 obviously i would prefer not to have the surgery and that would be better for me in the long term but i can only give myself so much time before i have to take matters further and decide to go for an operation
3525056 surgery can be risky and that is why ive tried to avoid it at all costs
3525057 i have damaged some connective tissue in my left wrist which holds one of the tendons in place you could say that the tendon is dislocating but it is not an actual dislocation
3525058 the good news is that there is nothing wrong with the tendon itself and if i was an ordinary member of the public it wouldnt make too much difference to my life the fact is that 95 of the time my wrist feels normal
3525059 its just that when it flexes in certain positions when i try to swing a club the tendon pops out
3525060 it has all been hugely frustrating and it is particularly annoying that this has happened to me in a ryder cup year
3525061 the cup only comes around every two years so i feel as if im missing out double
3525062 basketball is for elites after all real americans and real american presidents play golf

3525073 this is a victory for californias students parents and education community this decision confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and homeschooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights
3525074 i am pleased that the courts have clarified the right of california parents to homeschool their children i have respected the right of parents to make educational decisions they feel are in the best interest of their children i recognize and understand the consternation that the earlier court ruling caused for many parents and associations involved in homeschooling it is my hope that todays ruling will allay many of those fears and resolve much of the confusion

3525085 you just have to make decisions one of them i made was to spend as much time as i could with my daughter we didnt have much of a social life
3525086 one time chelsea said she heard about coconuts and had never seen one so we went to the store and bought a coconut we took it home
3525087 whats really important and what you have to work on is to be present with your children it so easy to be looking at your blackberry to be on your cell phone somehow you have to create the space and time where your children really know they have your undivided attention
3525088 you really cannot extrapolate from my experience because chelsea was a teenager in the white house which meant that the secret service went on her dates a lot of her girlfriends mothers loved it when they double dated because you know there was the guy with the gun in the front seat
3525089 i want to provide immediate relief as well as a long term plan on how were going to end our addition to foreign oil we have got to have a sensible energy policy we havent had it and weve paid a big price for it

3525104 because we russians remember those days when we were quite friendly i vacationed almost every summer on the black sea in georgia theyre great people so friendly
3525105 i hope intelligent russians are against their government and i think most russian americans support the georgians the russian government will always be the same even if its name changes

3525138 the expansion of nuclear energy in the united states as a major component of our national energy policy
3525139 concerns over climate change suggest a larger role for nuclear power as an energy supply choice
3525140 the nuclear power 2010 program is working with industry to demonstrate the nuclear regulatory commission s new streamlined licensing process
3525141 in over 50 years of operating experience the nuclear industry still has not managed to solve the problems of safety security and disposal of highly dangerous radioactive waste
3525142 until that happens were much better off investing in safer cleaner energy sources such as renewable wind geothermal tidal and solar projects
3525143 the fate of biological diversity for the next 10 million years will almost certainly be determined during the next 50 to 100 years by the activities of a single species
3525144 the worlds remaining wild areas and the species in them are being pulverized and thats a multi layered tragedy
3525145 education and employment for women especially along with access to contraception and safe abortions are the most important components
3525146 the most basic response is to get going on stopping population growth and starting a decline second is doing something about consumption if you dont do anything about those then you are in trouble in all the others more people means more greenhouse gases which means more rapid climate change
3525147 scientists are already seeing signs of changing occurring more quickly than they expected these signs range from high temperatures low rainfall drought and diseases leading to worsening economic conditions
3525148 the best local example that comes to mind is the recent power crisis our dear nation experienced

3525150 understandably one of the most common questions posed by breast cancer survivors is what are the chances of it coming back
3525151 now we can tell some women within a certain percentage their future risk of recurrence and clinicians may be able to make more informed decisions regarding prescription of extended adjuvant endocrine therapy
3525152 the magnitude of risk of recurrence should indicate a need for us to consider extended endocrine treatment for eligible women to further lower their risks
3525153 promise grants are designed to bring the worlds best minds together people who might not ordinarily collaborate and to provide those experts with the resources to focus and solve one serious problem in breast cancer and to get results to patients quickly
3525154 we are addressing the large gap in funding for this kind of research and we are addressing it in a big way
3525155 american was quick to recognize with us that substantial amounts of funding are needed now to research and halt inflammatory breast cancer through this first promise grant american is making a critical investment in comprehensive treatment for this rare disease
3525156 these airplanes will be a visible reminder virtually everywhere of the work still left to do in the breast cancer fight
3525157 the employees of american airlines and american eagle are very proud to support susan g komen for the cure
3525158 while tremendous strides have been made in the overall treatment of breast cancer until now theres been very little research into this rare disease that behaves so differently than other breast cancers
3525159 the global cancer community will stand to benefit from our comprehensive research program and what we learn about this disease the only way to achieve better outcomes for women with the disease is to have dedicated resources such as the funds allocated by komen and american airlines for continued ibc research

3525162 her ideas are a rare if not entirely new approach to natural history
3525163 the science of selecting trees for different uses around the world has not been well studied
3525164 she holds fast to the notion that if you are in the aura of a black walnut tree theres a healing effect
3525165 it needs more science to be able to say that
3525166 in a walk through old growth forest there are thousands if not millions of chemicals and their synergistic effects with one another
3525167 what trees do chemically in the environment is something were only beginning to understand
3525168 we need more research of this kind to use the things we have such as trees to their fullest
3525169 theres an enormous difference between old growth forests and tree plantations

3525176 we said people are dying we cant sing and dance here
3525177 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3525178 subsequent statements have been a reflection of events on the ground
3525179 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3525180 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3525181 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3525182 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3525183 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3525184 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3525185 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated
3525186 it is only proper for senator pimentel the author of joint senate resolution no 10 and 11 other senators who signed the resolution to recall their sponsorship now that malaca ang is using the resolution as instrument to sneak its sinister game plan for chacha
3525187 mrs arroyos political survival and her obsession to remain in power beyond 2010 as prime minister is the ultimate reason why she and her political lieutenants are calling for chacha everybody knows and the senators are very much aware of this game plan of the arroyo ruling club
3525188 mrs arroyo has found an opening in senate resolution no 10 to vigorously pursue her chacha and her dream to become the countrys prime minister once the reactionary charter is opened for revision arroyo and her allies in congress would do the job to assure her political game plan in 2010 and beyond

3525249 these were programs that she broadcast in dutch and had never before been translated into english essentially its kind of like finding a fort knox in terms of original content from corrie ten boom thats never been translated into english
3525250 there was virtually nothing that we had to change in terms of updating or making something relevant or taking a message and thinking what shes saying here is not pertinent for today its remarkably timeless the devotional thoughts that she had
3525251 our hope is that there will be a whole new generation of people and readers out there who may not have been familiar with corrie ten boom and her story and the hiding place who will be brand new to this story
3525252 today were giving back a little bit here we were over the 1 300 level on the s amp p 500 yesterday that was looked at as a pretty good sign
3525253 how this story plays out really depends on whether the weakness in financials bleeds out to other sectors in the economy
3525254 kylan is just getting back into creating art again and was in a group show at fifty24sf a couple years back i really dug the work and was hoping to see more from him but he sort of disappeared from the art scene turns out kylan was busy with a day job as an art director for a mens clothing company and only turned out 2 large scale paintings over the course of three years he recently left that gig and is now focusing more attention on his art
3525255 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3525256 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3525257 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3525258 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3525259 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3525260 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3525261 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3525262 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom

3525267 and then i called on congress to join me and to lift the legislative ban to end the legislative ban unfortunately the democratic leadership in congress decided to go on a five week vacation a recess rather than act on behalf of the american consumer the american small business owner

3525269 in the run up to the olympics it seems that chinese authorities are so obsessed with projecting an image of stability and harmony that they have really come down quite hard on human rights activists and lawyers
3525270 the peoples republic of china the olympics countdown broken promises
3525271 the chinese authorities have used the olympics and the cleanup before the olympics as an excuse to maintain and extend a draconian detention system that they had called re education through labor
3525272 what that really means is that theyre punished through forced labor to be taught a lesson and thousands of people who have ordinary complaints or demand reforms of the chinese government have instead been rounded up
3525273 we hope amnesty international can take off the colored glasses it has worn for many years and see china in an objective way
3525274 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
3525275 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
3525276 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few web sites that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people

3525278 chinas political reality is a place where no freedom of expression will really be allowable this goes for the chinese people and the foreign journalists
3525279 china is always afraid that if it lets its own people speak freely and spontaneously organize by itself the chinese communist party could be endangered or even be threatened
3525280 they also feel since they got the olympics the world is coming anyway by this point they can just do what they want and just let the world tolerate rather than have to fundamentally change their own behavior
3525281 beijings public air quality reporting has been a misinformation campaign
3525282 individuals traveling to the 2008 olympic summer games should plan and prepare for the high levels of outdoor pollutant in beijing and limit or avoid outdoor exercise
3525283 this is really a significant opportunity lost for the chinese government to show to the world that they really trust their own people a sign of a china that is ready to take its place in the first ranks in the nations of the world
3525284 the more profitable labor services component of revenue grew faster than total revenue again in fiscal 2008

3525322 yknow i hear all about this change thing but i have to say after reading his memoirs and interviews the majority of which lament the somewhat sainted father who left behind 4 womens children and barely made time or resources for him and his mother and noting the deliberate choices he has made in his own life i think he longs for a traditional patriarchical model of women in perpetual service one where man exists to serve god or country or at the very least his own personal ambitions justified in whatever way he chooses and that woman exists to serve man is that change to me not so much

3525393 situations like this lead to a general sense of instability and so i think investors will have to weigh up chances of continuing problems in the region going forward
3525394 diplomatic developments initiated by the european union and the organization for security and co operation in europe osce in the last 48 hours are encouraging
3525395 but the international community must also press for a regional plan to prevent the reoccurrence of hostilities
3525396 to have these businesses police themselves not have buildings abandoned or boarded up but to have operating legitimate businesses that police themselves amp conform to the law

3525398 they dont want it theyre just as shocked to find that they have these type of problems as police are there are issues where sometimes they may not pay as strict attention as they should but they are getting control of the situation

3525509 we want the eu to acknowledge the aggression by russia
3525510 we have to discuss and revise our negotiations because russias actions constitute a clear violation of international law and the united nations charter and such actions should have consequences
3525511 central and eastern european countries might like to take the opportunity to take a swipe at the russians as one would expect
3525512 they may put these things forward but i would not necessarily say thats going to be the outcome
3525513 appears to be to damage georgia militarily and economically to such an extent that its capacity to resist politically is severely weakened

3525550 i can be in the outfield and play every day i dont want to dh
3525551 i dont feel like a baseball player when i dh i dont know how to be the leader that i am from the bench i cant be a vocal leader i cant talk to guys from the bench because i dont feel right about it
3525552 im in a role now where i dont know what to do really the guys are out there busting their butt for nine innings they come in and they hit and they grind i just sit down and hit thats all i do so i cant be in a leadership role from that position
3525553 i told him that all i had here for him was a dh if he did not want to accept that do not accept the trade
3525554 im still confused by the article because it talks about platoon doesnt set well gary sheffield never platooned here
3525555 platoon is when you have a left hand hitter and a right hand hitter one plays against right hand pitching and one plays against left hand pitching that is a platoon
3525556 anybody that has a brain knows thats not a platoon
3525557 i come in some days and i dont play and some days i play thats platooning to me
3525558 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3525559 i never accepted that i was just a pure dh
3525560 a dh is a guy that couldnt do anything else and im not that
3525561 i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work
3525562 if hes found out he doesnt like it well thats the only role we have for him at this time
3525563 he has not shown from a health perspective that hes been able to play every day in the outfield he just has to perform the task thats asked of him
3525564 im sure hes frustrated because injuries have not enabled him to do what hes done in the past
3525565 i totally understand that hes a potential hall of fame guy and ive always told him to say what he feels just remember that everyone doesnt agree with it

3525571 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3525572 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3525573 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3525574 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3525575 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3525576 this grant will allow us to complete the renovation of the building so every square inch of the mens ministry center will have been renovated

3525581 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3525582 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3525586 the message id really like to get across is that these recurrence rates are actually pretty low and i hope these numbers are reassuring to women because women who are five year survivors of breast cancer often think they are still at high risk for recurrence

3525588 it just doesnt focus on recurrence rates but includes local recurrence metastatic disease and a new primary breast cancer these are three different things

3525594 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with these names in olympic history its a pretty amazing accomplishment
3525595 it sounds like a game you might play on queerty or something but you can just do it on you know nbcs olympics web site
3525596 in the run up to the olympics it seems that chinese authorities are so obsessed with projecting an image of stability and harmony that they have really come down quite hard on human rights activists and lawyers
3525597 the peoples republic of china the olympics countdown broken promises
3525598 the chinese authorities have used the olympics and the cleanup before the olympics as an excuse to maintain and extend a draconian detention system that they had called re education through labor
3525599 what that really means is that theyre punished through forced labor to be taught a lesson and thousands of people who have ordinary complaints or demand reforms of the chinese government have instead been rounded up
3525600 we hope amnesty international can take off the colored glasses it has worn for many years and see china in an objective way
3525601 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
3525602 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
3525603 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few web sites that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
3525604 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games
3525605 chinas political reality is a place where no freedom of expression will really be allowable this goes for the chinese people and the foreign journalists
3525606 china is always afraid that if it lets its own people speak freely and spontaneously organize by itself the chinese communist party could be endangered or even be threatened
3525607 they also feel since they got the olympics the world is coming anyway by this point they can just do what they want and just let the world tolerate rather than have to fundamentally change their own behavior
3525608 beijings public air quality reporting has been a misinformation campaign
3525609 individuals traveling to the 2008 olympic summer games should plan and prepare for the high levels of outdoor pollutant in beijing and limit or avoid outdoor exercise
3525610 this is really a significant opportunity lost for the chinese government to show to the world that they really trust their own people a sign of a china that is ready to take its place in the first ranks in the nations of the world

3525620 people who commit crimes we have no use for them
3525621 we have enough u s citizens involved in crime i am not defending them
3525622 this is not what you call a hard core criminal
3525623 you dont have a crime of violence or a crime of drugs it is crime of failing to file taxes
3525624 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3525625 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3525626 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3525627 we must continue to pursue the truth and facts and hold any wrongdoers accountable
3525628 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3525629 there was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the department and there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware or should have been aware of problems
3525630 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed
3525631 when youre out in front first you get to define the territory and cbs was amazingly successful with that
3525632 but when youre top dog its almost as if theres nowhere to go but down
3525633 if that were on animal planet it would have been the biggest thing theyve ever seen
3525634 but its all economies of scale and cbs needs a much larger bang if its going to invest its buck
3525635 the philosophy at cbs with regards to reality tv is actually a sound one

3525642 rest assured we are doing our best to have the money released we are trying to set meetings with dbm officials to urge them to act on our request with dispatch

3525696 now is the time for action not just words it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a case fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met

3525710 i have friends who sleep with a different girl every week practically im okay with it but im not sure id want to sleep with them at least not until they settled down and could be okay with just one girl so for me the actual number might not matter as much as their attitude that said 100 sexual partners is a little promiscuous and i think 20 to 50 over a lifetime is my limit i dont think i could sleep with more than that without feeling gross personally
3525711 for dudes its a tough question i will probably think that any guy has slept with too many and i would say the average for a guy is probably 40 to 50 women that is just too many ideally i would like a guy to sleep with 15 to 25 personally ive slept with 14 and i would rather not sleep with more than 30 in my lifetime also what about if you sleep with boys and girls say youve slept with 20 dudes but 50 women is that too many i dont know
3525712 more than 30 sexual partners for anyone is too many actually maybe more than 25 thirty is a lot too i would say that goes for anyone but i dont really care how many people my friends sleep with as it doesnt really affect my friendship with them so i guess it matters more to me for sexual partners
3525713 at 25 when i was able to tell my long term boyfriend that he was my 10th i felt like that was a good number for me someone who had some relationships dated but no long term commitments i felt that 10 wasnt so high that i screamed easy however if my boyfriend and i broke up tomorrow i think i would be quicker to sleep with men earlier on in dating than i was when i was 20 and worried about being called a slut in college now that im more comfortable with sex and sexuality in general if we broke up tomorrow i could hit 20 by age 30 and i would be fine with that and i would hope that if i were single at 35 i would have lots of partners as opposed to only a couple more sex with different men is what i envy about single women at this age and older sleeping with one or two more men for fear of being labeled sounds like a really boring way to spend my and if i were single
3525714 i think over 100 is really excessive people who stay single longer are obviously going to have had more partners but now there are all sorts of things even condoms cant prevent if a friend of yours got crazy and slept with someone new once a month i probably wouldnt blink twice but if they never have a dry spell or never get into a serious relationship through their entire 20s that puts them at approximately 120 partners by age 30 and usually my head snaps back when i hear someone other than a porn star has slept with over 100 people
3525715 if a guy told me he slept with 200 women i would be put off but mostly because i would be worried about disease not really about him being a womanizer
3525716 i dont really have a number that seems like too much i think that sometimes very high numbers indicate that a person might be pathological of course age and personality are factors as is relationship history id say anything over 50 for either men or women would make me take pause not necessarily in a negative way just in a dang gina way
3525717 over the course of someones life assuming they dont get married and settle down which presumably puts an end to the racking up of bed partners all bets are off if i had no desire to settle down and just went from relationship to relationship the way most people do with little droughts and little slutty phases in between i could very realistically be talking hundreds of partners by the end of my life i dont know that that would be excessive as long as youre not endangering your health or cheating on a monogamous partner or trying to fill an emotional void i see nothing wrong with getting your swerve on regularly

3525743 women were significantly more likely to start drinking heavily but less likely to start binge drinking or have alcohol related problems compared with men which may be due to women turning to drinking as a coping mechanism whereas men may have a higher propensity for risk taking behaviors

3525760 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3525761 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3525762 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3525763 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

3525782 from my perspective i had been expecting oil prices to level off it should lead to some slowing in the future in headline inflation and should also be to the good from the point of view of inflation expectations so i do think that while things are playing out to whats expected or maybe even better than expected it should help to alleviate some of the inflation concerns and inflation pressures that we had been confronting

3525820 so you know this election if it goes one way we could see a re imposition of the fairness doctrine there is a discussion of it in congress i think it wont be called the fairness doctrine by folks who are promoting it i think it will be called something else and i think itll be intertwined into the net neutrality debate

3525927 the goal is to ensure that professionals have the skills to design non residential structures in all major materials including wood

3526037 what is more significant is what long term rules the sec plans to propose
3526038 would force firms to spend money to automate their systems and would add costs to both brokers and customers in the form of increased borrowers fees
3526039 in this time of economic uncertainty that would not be a popular outcome for wall street

3526060 edwards affair was media part of a conspiracy of silence
3526061 rumors about john edwards love affair had been circulating for months but it wasnt until the former democratic presidential candidate admitted to the affair that national news organizations jumped on the story
3526062 cnns howard kurtz said news organizations were clinging to a very important standard dont run allegations that you cant prove
3526063 edwards affair was media part of a conspiracy of silence
3526064 on this particular story most major news networks took the stance that the rumors of an affair were not newsworthy
3526065 dont look at god through your circumstances look at your circumstances through god
3526066 we should crank up the music and dance all over the house
3526067 it is doubtful whether god can bless anyone greatly until he has hurt him deeply
3526068 lee stranahan is a writer photographer and independent filmmaker he makes short political parodies for news junkies that mash up current events advertising techniques obscure references and things he saw on tv during the 1970s it seems that hes not funny when he parodies people you like but is paradoxically quite funny when he parodies people you hate
3526069 say it aint so elizabeth you knew but supported his run for president
3526070 as i write this were just a couple of hours into the official mainstream media phase of the john edwards scandal and im already surprised something has happened that i didnt anticipate ive lost respect for elizabeth edwards
3526071 the john edwards interview which he states will be his very last comment on the subject hasnt aired yet
3526072 but we do have a statement from elizabeth edwards she knew about edwards affair prior to his run for office
3526073 just taking the edwards current statements at their words i am left with a very uncomfortable truth both john and elizabeth edwards cynically used their marriage as a means to help john edwards win an election
3526074 im sure ill get some angry comments here but if youre an edwards supporter let me put this bluntly if you gave john and elizabeth edwards time money support or goodwill they played you they made a conscious decision to make their relationship a focus throughout the campaign
3526075 then when the rumors first surfaced they made the worst decision of all they decided to lie about it and to keep lying about it for months
3526076 elizabeth edwards shouldnt have supported his bid for the white house and she especially shouldnt have helped him promote the story about what a great husband he was
3526077 elizabeth edwards as a wife friend and adviser should have told her husband emphatically and in no uncertain terms to wait and to get the story of the affair out in the open as soon as possible imagine if the affair story had been revealed back in early 2007 some people myself included wouldnt have cared much in the first place others would have forgiven edwards an affair in four or eight years especially if edwards filled that time with good works and devotion to his family
3526078 because i believe in the edwards agenda i still want to believe in the edwards as people right now though i dont see either of them as victims of anything but their own ambition
3526079 other than the fact that you dont have 92 telling you exactly what is coming and what to expect there really isnt much difference this year
3526080 it isnt like its a new position for me im a starter now thats it
3526081 im just going to build on what we established last year and continue getting better
3526082 maybe i am baiting some offensive coordinators not to double team me right now
3526083 honestly i am the new guy on the block but i feel i am going to go out there and give whoever tries to block me a long night
3526084 we have everything in already that we are going to throw at people
3526085 its a lot of the same things but we have more twists to them it will be a little more complex but we are ready for that now we can make a lot of the calls he is making
3526086 we were angry that detroit scored on the first drive and i like that

3526095 for the kingdom of god is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the holy spirit
3526096 nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells
3526097 i was sought by those who did not ask for me i was found by those who did not seek me i said here i am here i am to a nation that was not called by my name i have stretched out my hands all day long to a rebellious people
3526098 for behold i create a new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered or come to mind
3526099 but the water that i shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life
3526100 he who believes in me as the scripture has said out of his heart will flow rivers of living water
3526101 then he brought me back to the door of the temple and there was water flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east and it was a river that i could not cross for the water was too deep water in which one must swim a river that could not be crossed when it reaches the sea its waters are healed and it shall be that every living thing that moves wherever the rivers go will live along the bank of the river on this side and that will grow all kinds of trees used for food their leaves will not wither and their fruit will not fail they will bear fruit every month because their water flows from the sanctuary their fruit will be for food and their leaves for medicine
3526102 now i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away
3526103 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him who hears say come and let him who thirsts come whoever desires let him take the water of life freely

3526112 i wouldnt want to speculate on the organizational structure that comes out of this what i can promise you is that were taking a comprehensive look at this issue so this is not onesies and twosies and a handful of fixes this is across the board
3526113 my pledge to all today is that the air force will keep the promise to our teammates and to our families and to all our partners who rely on us every day
3526114 that trust is critical is born from expertise respect for our joint partners and rigorous accountability we will work together to reinvigorate the air forces institutions and show ourselves completely worthy of americas trust

3526116 my viewers and fans have routinely been given access to a very different side of our men in and out of uniform

3526118 joe focuses on the men and their personalities even if it means leaving out the sex and theres something just as fucking sexy about that approach
3526119 really let you experience what its like to have straight military buddies who are such tight friends they really do hang out naked and chill together its a unique approach but one that has really paid off you wouldnt believe how well it converts
3526120 straight marines with girls was a very popular feature on my straight buddy

3526134 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3526135 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3526136 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3526137 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3526138 hey im not an anti semite and this proves it
3526139 such an idea is so outlandish only notorious anti semites like phillip weiss would approvingly repeat it

3526155 we do not believe that an internal provincial police investigation would be seen as fair transparent objective or credible enough to bring all the answers that people are looking for
3526156 we found this meeting very positive and it allowed the families to ask questions which we answered
3526157 we reassured the family that we are taking this investigation seriously this inquiry will be handled with integrity impartiality and with rigour
3526158 were not at the point where we have to meet these people right away
3526159 the advantage of a public inquiry is that it will look for the motives that feed this hatred of the police system
3526160 the other advantage of a public inquiry is that we will be able to analyze the intervention methods of police
3526161 it was a dream come true just to race here
3526162 was to reach over the table and punch the doctor who was giving me the news
3526163 if certain tests had come back elevated my parents would have stepped in
3526164 it would be great if the story ended there but beneath the veneer a very different picture is continuing to unfold
3526165 peel away the effect of higher commodity prices and monthly performance immediately sours
3526166 the downside in terms of those higher prices is that it may be cutting back demand for these products and weighing on the volumes of those exports
3526167 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3526168 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3526169 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3526170 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3526171 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3526172 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3526173 we think byrd can add a veteran presence and some stability to our starting rotation hes been on a roll lately hes someone we think can be dependable for us and we know what were going to get every fifth day it just seemed like the right time to have this kind of stabililzer you never want to get caught short on starting pitching in august and september this was an opportunity to add a veteran that we feel we can trust without dipping into our farm system
3526174 by no means are we giving up on clay buchholz far from it we still think hes going to be a huge part of our future and may well be an important part of our present that said we think this move gives us the freedom to do the right thing in our rotation rather than forcing people into roles because of injuries
3526175 we told buck what were doing and that well have some more defninite plans in the next day give us a day to shake this thing out a bit
3526176 her ideas are a rare if not entirely new approach to natural history
3526177 the science of selecting trees for different uses around the world has not been well studied
3526178 she holds fast to the notion that if you are in the aura of a black walnut tree theres a healing effect
3526179 it needs more science to be able to say that
3526180 in a walk through old growth forest there are thousands if not millions of chemicals and their synergistic effects with one another
3526181 what trees do chemically in the environment is something were only beginning to understand
3526182 we need more research of this kind to use the things we have such as trees to their fullest
3526183 theres an enormous difference between old growth forests and tree plantations
3526184 refuses to pay plaintiffs at the correct royalty rate for its digital exploitation of the capricorn masters

3526189 di certo c bisogno di pi approfondimento pi critica e meno manipolazione mediatica e la rete unoccasione da non buttare via ma naturalmente non sar la tecnologia a correggere i difetti di una societ inquinata da pregiudizi potenti e comportamenti superficiali saranno le persone che si vogliono occupare di questa societ regalando un poco del loro tempo allinformazione attiva ma attenzione non si tratta di un progetto di informazione attiva destinato a restare confinato in un contesto necessariamente minoritario anzi si pu sostenere che le tendenze costruttive di diversi media si vadano unificando i libri il web la musica i video documentari il passaparola i cambiamenti che attraversano questi mondi mediatici sono importanti e insieme possono generare ondate di consapevolezza piuttosto importanti quando questo fenomeno si manifesta con vigore e per un tempo abbastanza lungo alcuni messaggi riescono a influenzare anche radio e giornali a quel punto la concorrenza alla tv pu essere molto forte

3526197 many of you had trouble accessing gmail for a couple of hours this afternoon and were really sorry the issue was caused by a temporary outage in our contacts system that was preventing gmail from loading properly everything should be back to normal by the time you read this
3526198 use the smtp capability that gmail provides to keep a local copy of your email inbox if thats not possible use a third party gmail backup service use your own domain and host the dns somewhere else so that you can switch email providers without having to change your email address keep a back up copy of important documents and other vital online assets finally make sure you know what recourse you have when things go wrong
3526199 self professed experts will tell you that requirements gathering is the most critical part of the project because if you get it wrong then all the rest of your work goes towards building the wrong thing this is sooooort of true in a skewed way but its not the complete picture

3526241 i am aware of a meeting that four priests of the episcopal diocese of fort worth have had with bishop kevin vann of the catholic diocese of fort worth on june 16 2008
3526242 the priests who participated in this meeting with bishop vann have my trust and pastoral support
3526243 their discussion with bishop vann has no bearing upon matters coming before our diocesan convention in november where a second vote will be taken on constitutional changes concerning our relationship with the general convention of the episcopal church
3526244 our only plan of action remains as it has been for the past year as affirmed by our diocesan convention in november 2007 the episcopal diocese of fort worth intends to realign with an orthodox province as a constituent member of the worldwide anglican communion
3526245 by gods grace we will continue to work and pray for the unity of the one holy catholic and apostolic church

3526266 if this agreement holds a big if its a better outcome than i would have expected georgias democratic government will remain in place despite russias previous determination to overthrow it the russians will not have destroyed georgias oil pipeline to europe the most important pipeline in the region that doesnt pass through russian or iranian territory and russia will renounce future use of force against georgia and reduce its forces in the secessionist regions of abkhazia and south ossetia to their prewar levels i am skeptical that the russians will fully respect the last two commitments nonetheless the outcome could have been far worse why did russia accept an arrangement that falls so far short of their maximum objectives

3526276 it would seem joe girardis perfect right to rest the brittle sore shouldered damon against a left handed pitcher the rest of the team has hit hard in the recent past
3526277 the idea that the move could be controversial says something about girardi and the way his first season as yankees manager is going one of girardis biggest problems seems to be the way he presents himself to the media covering the team particularly after tough losses where joe torre was nearly always charming and outwardly patient with questions even those he deemed silly or repetitive girardi is often curt and testy theres nothing actually unusual about this its the way most managers and probably most people period handle such situations torre not girardi was the exception and those of us who covered torre for years and years probably got spoiled that doesnt excuse girardis persistent maddening secrecy regarding the most harmless of his managerial thought processes and it doesnt excuse his snapping at reporters whose questions he doesnt like

3526286 and it shall come to pass in that day that i will call my servant eliacim the son of helcias and i will clothe him with thy robe and will strengthen him with thy girdle and will give thy power into his hand and he shall be called a father pope to the inhabitants of jerusalem rome and to the house of juda church and i will lay the key of the house of david upon his shoulder and he shall open and no one shall shut and he shall shut and no one shall open
3526287 i am the first and the last alive and was dead and behold i am living for ever and ever and have the keys of death and hell
3526288 these things saith the holy one and the true one who hath the keys of david he that openeth and no man shutteth shutteth and no man openeth
3526289 whatsoever thou shall bind upon earth shall be bound also in heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
3526290 in spite of all protestant attempts to weaken its force it cannot be doubted that this passage contains the solemn proclamation of the primacy of peter he is declared to be the foundation of the church the bearer of the keys and the sovereign lawgiver whose precepts and prohibitions have the force of divinely sanctioned laws
3526291 and jesus looking upon him said thou art simon the son of jona thou shalt be called cephas which being interpreted is peter
3526292 as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all those that trust in him for who is god save the lord or who is a rock tsur save our god
3526293 as for my god his way is undefiled the words of the lord are fire tried he is the protector of all that trust in him for who is god but the lord or who is god tsur but our god
3526294 unto thee will i cry o lord my rock tsur ibid 28 1 i will say unto god my rock tsur ibid 42 9 truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock tsur and my salvation my soul wait thou only upon god my rock tsur and my salvation he is my rock tsur

3526298 thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it
3526299 and i will give unto you the keys to the kingdom of heaven
3526300 and whatever you shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven
3526301 peter is made the foundation because he says thou are christ the son of the living god and hears in reply that he is a rock but although a rock he is not such a rock as christ for christ is truly an immovable rock but peter only by virtue of that rock i e christ for jesus bestows his dignities on others he is a priest and he makes priests a rock and he makes a rock what belongs to himself he bestows on his servants
3526302 in the catholic church i adhere to the chair of peter whoever does not wish to stray from the true fold must follow this voice
3526303 jesus rose up out of the synagogue and went into peters house
3526304 and jesus going into a ship that was peters he taught the multitude out of the ship luke 5 3

3526306 philip presbyter and legate of pope celestine i said we offer our thanks to the holy and venerable synod that when the writings of our holy and blessed pope had been read to you
3526307 philip the presbyter and legate of the apostolic see rome said
3526308 the lord says to peter i say to you he says that you are peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell will not overcome it and to you i will give the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever things you bind on earth shall be bound also in heaven and whatever you loose on earth they shall be loosed also in heaven mt 16 18 19 on him peter he builds his church and to him he gives the command to feed the sheep jn 21 17 and although he assigns a like power to all the apostles yet he founded a single chair and he established by his own authority a source and an intrinsic reason for that unity indeed the others were also what peter was ie apostles but a primacy is given to peter whereby it is made clear that there is but one church and one chair so too all the apostles are shepherds and the flock is shown to be one fed by all the apostles in single minded accord if someone does not hold fast to this unity of peter can he imagine that he still holds the faith if he should desert the chair of peter upon whom the church was built can he still be confident that he is in the church
3526309 suffer the little children to come to me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of heaven
3526310 ignatius theophorus to the church in the place of the country of the romans which holds the primacy

3526312 t he lord said to peter on this rock i will build my church i have given you the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatever you shall have bound or loosed on earth will be bound or loosed in heaven matt 16 18 19 upon you he says i will build my church and i will give to you the keys not to the church and whatever you shall have bound or you shall have loosed not what they shall have bound or they shall have loosed
3526313 as members of the mystical body of the church it behooves us to follow our head the roman pontiff who holds in trust the deposit of the apostolic faith from him we are to learn what we are bound to believe to think and to hold by divine right everyone bows down the head before him
3526314 simon magus so deceived the city of rome that claudius erected a statue of him
3526315 in the power of the same holy spirit peter both the chief of the apostles and the keeper of the keys of the kingdom of heaven in the name of christ healed aeneas the paralytic at lydda which is now called diospolis acts 9 32 34
3526316 neither was julius bishop of the great rome there nor had he sent a substitute although an ecclesiastical canon church law commands that the churches shall not make any ordinances against the opinion of the bishop of rome
3526317 athanasius meanwhile after a lengthened journey at last reached italy the western division of the empire was then under the sole power of constans the youngest of constantines sons his brother constantine having been slain by the soldiers as was before stated at the same time also paul bishop of constantinople asclepas of gaza marcellus of ancyra a city of the lesser galatia and lucius of adrianople having been accused on various charges and expelled from their several churches arrived at the imperial city there each laid his case before julius bishop of rome he on his part by virtue of the church of romes peculiar privilege sent them back again into the east fortifying them with commendatory letters and at the same time restored to each his own place and sharply rebuked those by whom they had been deposed relying on the signature of the bishop julius the bishops departed from rome and again took possession of their own churches forwarding the letters to the parties to whom they were addressed
3526318 jesus said simon my follower i have made you the foundation of the holy church i betimes called you peter because you will support all its buildings you are the inspector of those who will build on earth a church for me if they should wish to build what is false you the foundation will condemn them you are the head of the fountain from which my teaching flows you are the chief of my disciples through you i will give drink to all peoples yours is that life giving sweetness which i dispense i have chosen you to be as it were the firstborn in my institution so that as the heir you may be executor of my treasures i have given you the keys of my kingdom behold i have given you authority over all my treasures
3526319 liberal catholics are simply catholics who have lost the faith
3526320 the church has but one ruler and one governor the invisible one christ whom the eternal father hath made head over all the church which is his body eph 1 22 23 the visible one the pope who as legitimate successor of peter the prince of the apostles fills the apostolic chair
3526321 it is the unanimous teaching of the fathers that this visible head is necessary to establish and preserve unity in the church
3526322 the same doctrine was long before established by saint irenaeus and cyprian
3526323 lastly st ambrose says because he alone of all of them professed christ he was placed above all
3526324 although the strength of the church is equally established on all the apostles
3526325 yet amongst the twelve one is chosen so that a head being appointed all occasion of schism may be taken away
3526326 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and co ordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
3526327 rather than being explained by a single factor an accumulation throughout life of many associated cultural personal and economic exposures is likely to underlie the risks for obesity and some elements of associated neurological function

3526330 we believe that this slowdown will accelerate throughout 2008 given the lag factor between revenues and investment banking job cuts and that markets will see very limited growth by q4
3526331 while the results are as expected we now see no positive catalysts in the next three months and believe short interest in the stock could increase
3526332 we are encouraged by the robust revenue growth which we achieved despite the backdrop of a challenging economic environment in the near term we expect to continue to deliver strong underlying profitability through integration related savings and steady revenue growth while we transform our markets division to be best positioned to capture the next cycle of strong growth

3526334 suspended its recognition of cuppys coffee and more llc as an aafd accredited contract recipient pending a determination of the associations board of directors that aafds accreditation of the cuppys contract should be withdrawn
3526335 due to the serious allegations that have been raised regarding cuppys failure to honor various contractual commitments and your apparent decision to cease our communications i have determined to suspend your accredited status with the aafd pending consideration and action of the aafd board of directors
3526336 in that the aafd board of directors next meeting is set for september 4 2008 i am acting to immediately to suspend cuppys accredited contract status pending action of the aafd board i am causing this action to be published on the aafd website and to appropriate media all listings of cuppys coffee will forthwith be removed from the aafd website and we are instructing cuppys management to remove all references to the aafd from its website and franchise marketing literature
3526337 our purpose remains to inspire fair contracts and collaborative relationships and we are open to negotiating and mediating effective relief for all cuppys franchisees in a manner that will effect restitution from injuries and will allow cuppys coffee to achieve the corporate goals set by new management upon its acquisition of the company
3526338 the path to a successful resolution of the cuppys quagmire is through communication negotiation collaboration and if necessary mediation the path to certain destruction is to ignore the problem and face an inevitable and costly litigative path

3526343 the overwhelming majority of republican senators have pledged to protect october 1 as american energy freedom day so we can reduce dependence on foreign oil and lower the cost of gas at the pump
3526344 many people arent aware that the bans on drilling must be renewed every year and all we have to do is allow these prohibitions to expire on october 1 in just 50 days americans will have the freedom to pursue their own energy resources here at home our letter is very straightforward we will actively oppose any effort to extend the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale
3526345 isnt this the same day that republicans would be endangering the delivery of social security checks because of their misguided attempts to promote energy policies that will do nothing to deal with the short term problems facing the country
3526346 we can do that we can have a vote on oil drilling
3526347 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them
3526348 they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3526349 we can do that we can have a vote on that
3526350 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them

3526362 sometimes we forget about them the rebels every day they say they are fighting for the poor people of darfur and yet what have they done to show even interest to go to the conference table
3526363 i am not in any way saying that the khartoum government is clean but what i am saying is that also the other side cannot be said to be saints so my appeal is that the pressure should be exerted on both sides
3526364 they will have to end on a negotiation table because militarily its clear no side can win the war in darfur
3526365 but if you have 15 20 parties wanting to go to conference table to talk nothing will come out of it

3526481 what causes fights and quarrels among you dont they come from your desires that battle within you you want something but dont get it you kill and covet but you cannot have what you want you quarrel and fight you do not have because you do not ask god when you ask you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives that you may spend what you get on your pleasures
3526482 this is the confidence we have in approaching god that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us and if we know that he hears us whatever we ask we know that we have what we asked of him

3526488 no matter how many women start out in physics a common trend across countries is their attrition in going from undergraduate and graduate studies to permanent positions
3526489 for all sciences the fraction of scientists who are women decreases as you go up in the hierarchy so if you start in high school taking science and then go on to college taking science and then go onto graduate school and then professors and so on at every level the fraction of women in any one field is decreasing its slightly different for different fields for example in physics the big drop is really in college in high school the classes are almost fifty fifty girls to boys but when you get to college only about 20 percent of the physics majors are women in other fields of science the big drop usually comes at a later point and the overall dearth of women is especially bad in physics
3526490 we seem to be really turning people off of physics in college
3526491 women want to help people so they go into the medical sciences
3526492 whats really interesting is that sociologists and psychologists have actually done a lot of research in these areas and what they find is contrary to what many scientists think
3526493 the reason there are no women in physics is because graduate school and assistant professorships happen during the years when you should be having a family and women dont think they can do both so they dont go into physics but the data show this doesnt keep women from other demanding professions for example medicine
3526494 in the science profession being objective is one of the most important qualities you can have
3526495 most of us really dont want to admit were not objective
3526496 but many scientists are reluctant to admit that because its unscientific
3526497 if we can admit that were biased then we try very hard to compensate for that bias and we try to be objective and to use objective criteria but if were quite convinced that we arent biased then we think we dont need to articulate why because were sure were unbiased and therefore it must be right
3526498 the thing about a hypothesis is that you can test it against the data
3526499 i had a new graduate student come in to talk to me after only a few weeks into the year
3526500 i told her that a lot of people could do what she did last summer but its not easy for most people to become a physicist
3526501 it turns out that these women are doing very well that theyre highly respected but the view that they have of themselves is quite low
3526502 somehow we have created this myth that doing science and physics in american universities is an elite ivory tower profession where youre pondering questions that dont have any practical applications in the real world and its all about just solving problems and being clever
3526503 as for the myth of the math gap in high school girls take as much math and physics as boys and they do just as well
3526504 what ive observed in my 25 years in the field is that there are lots of young women who are really excited about physics who just love it
3526505 but if you start talking to senior graduate students you find a very different picture
3526506 when you talk to the people who actually know them it turns out that in fact these women are doing very well that theyre highly respected but the view that they have of themselves is quite low
3526507 my personal interpretation of what happens is that we go out of our way to discourage people from pursuing physics
3526508 professors will tell you that you have to go do something else that youre not good enough the correct response is
3526509 oh you think im not good enough i guess im not let me think about what else im going to do with my life
3526510 my hypothesis which is colored by my own perception is that the more elitist the field the fewer the women
3526511 were fooling ourselves thinking were getting the cream of the crop what were really doing is chasing away really bright people
3526512 women need to better understand the mechanisms of hiring funding and promotions that is how to play the game
3526513 i think first of all they have to recognize that thats the case that there is a lot of information that they are not naturally going to get and they have to go out and seek it and for many young men maybe that isnt necessary maybe they dont have to seek it out
3526514 i think its easiest to talk to somebody to relate to like you
3526515 so the advice i give young women is find yourself a bunch of mentors first of all people at your level peers who are postdocs or faculty or whatever you are
3526516 and also go to these older guys and more or less force them to mentor you
3526517 if you are an outsider the way science runs in the us at least you really cant succeed
3526518 there are also organizations within institutions within companies within professions that make this easier
3526519 for women doubting themselves we all have self doubt and theres always another hurdle maybe its getting tenure but then you want to get elected to fellowship in your professional society
3526520 men may have many of the same self doubts and concerns about their future they just dont dare think about it for most men you dont have that option to not work it wouldnt be acceptable and i bet thats really scary
3526521 women are just constantly wondering am i good enough should i be doing this maybe i should be doing something else
3526522 in terms of having a family and getting married if you have the kind of relationship where one of you is more important than the other one then no i dont think you can have a career and a family
3526523 i have been asked so many times by women can i do physics and have a family i have never once been asked that by a young man ever its just not a question for men

3526533 the mother has been located we are investigating what she told us has happened to see if its true
3526534 as long as the kids are safe thats all we look for
3526535 some of the people that see the kids wandering around they bring them to the office because from time to time we pretty well know the kids around here
3526536 videoegg provides an extremely rich ad experience with viral tools that let consumers accelerate and perpetuate our media buys
3526537 the videoegg pricing model also provides accountability as it guarantees engagement with our target audiences
3526538 we need to replace the banner with portable media experiences that leverage the power of video feeds maps and localization we can get consumers to engage
3526539 flies in the face of state sovereignty and democratic principles
3526540 we appreciate the opportunity to submit comments on the regulation under the notification proposed by the state of vermont
3526541 its simply not ok for other governments foreign national governments to feel they have a right to intervene in our state legislative process in the way china has

3526544 you can tell a tree by its fruit none of those who cry out lord lord will enter the kingdom of god but only those who do the will of my father in heaven
3526545 lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or away from home or naked or ill or in prison and not attend you in your needs
3526546 we must do this if we would fulfill all of gods demands
3526547 my father if this cannot pass me by without my drinking it your will be done
3526548 your will be done on earth as it is in heaven

3526550 this is my son the beloved in whom i am well pleased
3526551 theres a lot of people out of work theres a lot of people that have been burnt out with no place to go everybodys losing their homes theres a lot of need out there for a homeless shelter
3526552 we see so many homeless people that need a place to go they come in and ask for help to get a place but we dont have the funds to help
3526553 something where we could get a grant for our building to turn the downstairs into a homeless shelter
3526554 we have plenty of space for them we have a full room apartment plus two other rooms and a possible third that we would use for them
3526555 we have a lot of fires here people that have been burned out no place to go no family
3526556 its a temporary step a place where they could stay for 30 days or so until they could get housed somewhere else
3526557 its realistic to say that the area is beautiful its very very productive when you consider the part of the country we moved from
3526558 it has water but for the first time in years were able to take advantage of crops and where weve lived you just dont have that opportunity
3526559 the net migration in grand traverse county when compared to other counties in the state grand traverse had the fifth highest net migration in the time period of 2000 to 2007
3526560 sales are very stable up here for our particular housing market and particularly in grand traverse county which would indicate that if we have people leaving we have just as many people coming in
3526561 people deciding to move into this area has to do with quality of life its the same thing that draws tourists into the area the water and the recreational opportunities people deciding to live in an area have a tendency to look at other issues like crime and if you look at our crime rates theyre lower than you have in urban areas
3526562 i dont think that we should sell short the fact that the chamber of commerce and the economic development corporation along with the convention and visitors bureau the cherry festival committee and these various groups have been working in a collaborative way to really promote this area and i think its really paying off
3526563 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and co ordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
3526564 rather than being explained by a single factor an accumulation throughout life of many associated cultural personal and economic exposures is likely to underlie the risks for obesity and some elements of associated neurological function
3526565 independent musicians dont have marketing departments and publicity teams working to get their music heard thats why it helps so much when you guys pitch in to help spread the word there are some things you can do to help out that may seem little to you but are huge for me

3526572 sometimes i think that jesus watches my neurotic struggles and shakes his head and grips his forehead and starts tossing back mojitos

3526575 thats okay when it comes to dark and scary places i prefer they be empty
3526576 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3526577 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3526578 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3526579 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
3526580 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3526581 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
3526582 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
3526583 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3526584 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3526585 a bee uses its long proboscis a complex tongue that enables them to obtain the nectar from flowers
3526586 it is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on insect pollination most of which is accomplished by bees
3526587 most bees are fuzzy and carry an electrostatic charge which aids in the adherence of pollen
3526588 pollen and nectar are combined to make a firm substance typically shaped like a sphere into which an egg is deposited the cell is typically sealed after the egg is laid and the adult and larva never interact directly
3526589 visiting flowers can be a dangerous occupation many assassin bugs and crab spiders hide in flowers to capture unwary bees other bees are lost to birds in flight insecticides used on blooming plants kill many bees both by direct poisoning and by contamination of their food supply a honey bee queen may lay 2 000 eggs per day during spring buildup but she also must lay 1 000 to 1 500 eggs per day during the foraging season mostly to replace daily casualties most of which are workers dying of old age
3526590 recently managed populations of western honey bees have experienced substantial declines this has prompted investigations into the phenomenon amidst great concern over the nature and extent of the losses one aspect of the problem is believed to be
3526591 according to egyptian mythology bees were created when the tears of the sun god ra landed on the desert sand
3526592 until the 17th century many people including beekeepers thought that bees reproduced spontaneously without the aid of sexual reproduction
3526593 the social organization of a hive rivals that in the best run corporations with each bee and each cell possessing a rigidly specific function
3526594 a worker bee can carry half her weight in nectar and pollen and still fly
3526595 without a trace something is causing bees to vanish by the thousands but a new task force hopes to finger the culprit and save the valuable crops that rely on the insects
3526596 you know i believe that each of us makes a choice everyday to make a new and better world i choose brown i believe in that choice
3526597 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3526598 we came to fight since our old neighbor russia thinks that it can fight us
3526599 this country thinks that old times will come back but that time is over everyone knows that the next one could be ukraine then poland

3526608 mukmin yang bergaul dengan manusia dan sabar atas gangguan mereka lebih baik daripada yang tidak bergaul dengan manusia dan tidak sabar atas gangguan mereka
3526609 sabar adalah suatu kondisi mental dalam mengendalikan nafsu yang tumbuhnya adalah atas dorongan ajaran agama
3526610 allah tidak akan menambah seseorang yang suka memberi maaf melainkan dengan kemuliaan
3526611 bukanlah orang yang gagah perkasa namanya ia yang kuat bergulat tetapi yang disebut gagah perkasa itu ialah orang yang dapat mengendalikan nafsunya dirinya ketika sedang marah

3526629 from web based cooperatives to public shareholding corporation processing plants to restaurants sustainable fisheries to union organic berry farms our case studies make clear that there is no one pathway to local food success
3526630 these enterprises have much to teach us about replicating what works and identifying untapped opportunities that can strengthen the local food movement

3526641 overweight children have already been exposed to salty sweet foods and learned to like them
3526642 to keep a child from becoming overweight parents need to expose them early to a variety of healthy foods and offer the foods many times
3526643 weve found that having regular doctors who although they dont live in nunavut come back to work on a regular basis has brought some of the advantages of full time doctors and avoided some of the disadvantages of doctors that dont know anything about the place
3526644 the main challenge to having doctors stay here has been the workloads
3526645 thats exacerbated when were short staffed because the work all falls on the shoulders of the people that are left and then youd drive them out because theyre exhausted and then youre even shorter staffed and so the workloads increase so it becomes a vicious circle
3526646 you have to have quite general skills and youve got to have the confidence to use them without constantly having backup
3526647 so its a challenge and quite satisfying when things go well
3526648 among adults with vision problems a public health gap exists in actual access to eye care services between canada and the united states primarily owing to the population without health insurance in the united states
3526649 the difference in use of eye care services between americans without health insurance and canadians narrowed when adjusted for income level and was almost eliminated when adjusted for having optional vision insurance
3526650 therefore public health interventions targeting adults with vision problems without health insurance might be more beneficial if they focused on those at risk for serious vision loss especially those in the lowest income group

3526670 getting the location right is a big challenge particularly in the uk where onshore turbines tend to be located on ridges or hills
3526671 when you are working on a ridge for example the wind flow and turbulence can be very different just 100 metres further down the ridge and the approaches are just too simple to detect those differences
3526672 sodars use a loud speaker to send out beeps of noise into the atmosphere
3526673 those sound waves get reflected back by wind flow and temperature variations and that gives you a good idea of where the turbulence is if you use three speakers you can get a 3d view ranging from a height of 20 metres to 300 metres from that you can work out the best location and height for the turbine and get a measure of how much strain the turbines will face
3526674 weve worked out a signal processing mechanism that means instead of sending out uniform beeps we can send out sound at different frequencies and then analyse its behaviour
3526675 it allows us to get much richer data from each pulse of sound and results in five times as many data points
3526676 we know that wind energy can and must play a critical role in securing our future needs
3526677 but our review of wind energy in the country finds that there is an urgent need to reassess the current policies and incentives so that the business of wind gets serious about generating power and not just installing wind farms and reaping benefits from fiscal incentives
3526678 in the current scheme which gives an accelerated depreciation benefit of 80 per cent and other tax incentives for installation of the plants wind energy has become the business of cash rich investors who take advantage of tax benefits and are not serious about generation of power
3526679 the current business is not geared to generation of power and increasing efficiencies and reducing costs this is clearly not good if we want wind energy to play an important role in our future energy security
3526680 the indian wind energy sector needs to be re energised and for that to happen policy needs to change and get real
3526681 too little too inadequate and too hesitant to change the business as it operates currently
3526682 we believed that was going to be the case but its nice to know now
3526683 we promised the town we would not spend any more taxpayer money than what they approved
3526684 that site has better wind speeds than the high school site providing an opportunity for increased power generation and savings it also has better set back options
3526685 both sites will be considered by the creb as we make our recommendations to the town council
3526686 the town council the school committee and all the volunteers that have participated in this process should be recognized for their courage to consider the options for renewable energy in our community
3526687 savings projections of well over 3 5 million after expenses during the expected life of the investment are only part of the story carbon reductions and the educational benefits that this project provides to our students and our community should expand its value even further
3526688 as the liaison to the creb weve had plenty of discussions about other alternative energy sources
3526689 but you can only focus on one project at a time
3526690 there has been discussion as to whether its feasible to put solar panels on all municipal buildings weve thought about it it has not gotten to the point where weve looked at the details
3526691 weve looked at underwater turbines were monitoring that i think that the technology has not yet been perfected that could be an interesting option
3526692 it is with great disappointment that we write this letter to inform you of aim powergen corporations decision to officially withdraw our interest association with the proposed simcoe shores wind farm
3526693 this town likes to keep their young people i might suggest that you listen to your young people
3526694 are you going to listen to anything anyone has to say at a public hearing
3526695 now if youve been blogging with me for some time you will know that i judge people for themselves not based on color religion sex or anything else
3526696 why is it that african american women tend to take care of their extended families and non families more so than our caucasion sisters
3526697 in the lower income black community however you have a history of women who are the main caregivers for their families so when their children have children it seems natural to in that instance step in
3526698 either way when it comes down to it deep love and genuine over protective nature of parents for their children is always better than not caring at all
3526699 but what i have yet to say is that it might be a conspiracy
3526700 the prevalence of three generation families who live together is greater among african americans than caucasians in addition african american families which are more likely than white families to be headed by single parents often rely substantially on the help of grandparents in everyday child care and cultural norms tend to be highly supportive of grandparents taking an active role
3526701 what is because you omitted that part were you talking about why aa grandmothers end up raising their grandchildren or more social issues please elaborate thanks for your input
3526702 furthermore african american grandparents are more apt tobe involved with their grandchildren than white grandparents the most reasonable explanation for this is
3526703 i am peace but these days nobody wants to keep me lit
3526704 i am faith but these days i am no longer indispensable
3526705 i am love and i havent the strength to stay lit any longer
3526706 people put me aside and dont understand my importance they even forget to love those who are nearest to them
3526707 why are you not burning you are supposed to stay lit until the end
3526708 dont be afraid for i am hope and while i still burn we can re light the other candles
3526709 spread love everywhere you go first of all in your own house let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier be the living expression of gods kindness kindness in your face kindness in your eyes kindness in your smile kindness
3526710 do not let trifles disturb the tranquility of your mind life is too precious to be sacrificed for the nonessential and transient ignore the inconsequential

3526714 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3526715 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia

3526730 mommy so they really did turn toby into a goblin
3526731 i think well be up late and that every vote will count
3526732 they even killed female goats because their private parts were not covered and their tails were pointed upward which they said was haram
3526733 they regarded the cucumber as male and tomato as female women were not allowed to buy cucumbers only men
3526734 i saw them slaughter a nine year old boy like a sheep because his family didnt pledge allegiance to them
3526735 very heavy handed killing of civilians backfired on them the sunnis just wouldnt stand for it any more
3526736 its just typical of this government and the way that theyve treated patel patients
3526737 theyve used and abused us from day one weve been abused with the compensation process weve been abused with every approach weve made for assistance for help and weve got no help and no assistance whatsoever from this government at all ever
3526738 in the absence of that data we shouldnt be fishing at risk species like hammerheads
3526739 instead we should be protecting their nursery grounds and protecting the place we know that sometimes they come together and aggregate places like the coral sea
3526740 only those people that have historically taken sharks will be able to have that fisheries symbol
3526741 i cant support fuelwatch in the way its been put up by the government
3526742 the governments fuelwatch scheme wont deliver benefits to consumers as has been asserted
3526743 when you consider that four government departments have said that this could actually put prices up rather than down when youve heard the evidence from the senate committee process its been quite damning
3526744 weve seen from the perth experience that it has forced a number of independent operators out of business
3526745 the actual mechanism thats been proposed by the government for fuelwatch would actually make things worse
3526746 i dont know if its a question of tweaking i think it has to be a lot more than tweaking
3526747 with fuelwatch itself family first has serious concerns and were still wanting to understand how it wont push average petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3526748 until were satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch either
3526749 if you were to ask motorists do you want less volatility in petrol prices they would probably say yes but if you were to ask motorists that it would come at a cost of purchasing petrol at a higher average price they would probably say im not so sure about that and thats the question at hand
3526750 its not a rubber stamp any more and it means the australian public cannot be taken for granted
3526751 it also means the government of the day just cant ram things through and ram through bad legislation
3526752 we wondered how everybody else did its interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short listed
3526753 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
3526754 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
3526755 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
3526756 you told me more about the process than i know
3526757 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
3526758 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
3526759 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
3526760 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
3526761 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
3526762 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands
3526763 while i take the committees concerns to heart i do not concur with the low scores
3526764 did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals

3526785 while we appreciate those nab members willingness to embrace a retransmission consent quiet period a start date of feb 4 2009 is simply too late and will not go far enough to protect consumers whose signals could be pulled by broadcasters before feb 4
3526786 were focused on the dtv transition theyre are focused on retransmission consent those are two very different sets of business issues
3526787 thats a business decision between the cable company or satellite provider and the local broadcaster
3526788 i dont want to speak on his behalf but martin seemed fine with it
3526789 he said his dates had just been kind of floating around in his min there was nothing magic about his dates
3526790 he is open to options but he has not made a decision on this one
3526791 any voluntary quiet period that does not begin before the agreements actually expire or which is too brief to preclude potentially confusing messages about broadcast carriage during the time of the actual dtv transition represents the illusion of a commitment and does not serve the consumer
3526792 many tv carriage contracts are coming up at the end of the year
3526793 i know fcc commissioner jonathan adelstein has supported the dec 15 date for the very reason the contracts would be expiring at the end of the year this would prevent any kind of ability of broadcasters to leverage that to the detriment of our members and certainly their customers
3526794 while we support a quiet period around the digital transition we strongly believe that all affected parties should be involved and reach a consensus on the parameters before moving forward
3526795 cbs has done many retrans deals with large and small cable operators with absolutely no disruption to the audience we share
3526796 we see nothing in our current negotiations that leads us to believe that will change so we see no need for the kind of quiet period sought by some cable operators
3526797 we are firmly committed to becoming a vendor of choice in the cable industry leveraging decades of systems and manufacturing excellence and todays announcement asserts our commitment
3526798 hee haw should be of particular interest to rfd tv viewers as this classic show by far has been the no 1 request to be added to our program lineup for the last three years
3526799 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3526800 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3526801 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3526802 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3526803 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3526804 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3526805 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3526806 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3526807 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3526808 its effectively the government holding a gun to the heads of the courts and saying cut firefighters wages or youll be responsible for people burning in their homes
3526809 we live in one of the richest countries in the world
3526810 it is totally preposterous that the government should be threatening to close fire stations if firefighters wages are raised up to meet inflation
3526811 this is our eleventh practice and there are about 12 000 college football players who are sore hurting and tired
3526812 this question is who is going to be able to push through it and improve what fatigue does is challenge your discipline we had a lot of mental errors and tired mistakes today
3526813 our team has to realize that there are consequences to it its not just a play in practice we pride ourselves in trying to develop a disciplined team and this is when you do it when you are tired its easy to do when you are fresh
3526814 it was very situational from coming out on the minus one to moving all the way down the field for a two point play
3526815 it will be a full blown scrimmage and we will see how it goes
3526816 no company no matter how well managed can avoid being impacted by weaknesses in its core business
3526817 if the company is forced by regulators to bring these 3 billion in auction rate securities on its book we estimate it might have to write down roughly 350 million in auction rate securities losses
3526818 we believe that aramark will improve the quality of our concessions and enhance the game day atmosphere for tech fans and alumni

3526820 we are excited about aligning our services with the vision that louisiana tech athletics has for its fans on gameday
3526821 we realize the impact that a high quality concessions experience will have on the overall fan experience and we are looking forward to meeting that standard
3526822 worth said the changes had been in the works long before the financial sector showed signs of strain we started thinking about this strategy 18 months ago when it was about the strongest deal market that we had ever seen he said

3526824 economists expect 2008s second half to be worse than the first
3526825 expecting to see input from a survey of 100 economists or even 50 a close examination found economists from only three sources
3526826 second paragraph from the end of the story inspired the headline with a senior economist at j p morgan citing the effect of weak exports and then mentioning the bottom line is its going to be a weak second half
3526827 other input came from goldman sachs unidentified economists who noted a contraction in consumer spending is likely over the second half and the risk that foreign demand weakness will wash back onto u
3526828 also noted was declining recent activity at american express co talbots inc kohls corp and gap inc
3526829 after reading the lengthy story its almost like the wsj seeks to curtail advertising from already shook up businesses and sprinkle more alarm at consumers

3526834 im now in a place where i can start thinking about my childhood my grandfather lived with us his clothing was from this period he was very important to me and i always was attuned to frank sinatra and other things like that it was a golden age for the united states
3526835 i know it s seen as a repressed period but its really a culturally open period a lot of freedom and a lot of ideas that we associate with the 60s were born in that period and i was interested in those environmentalism attitudes towards materialism bohemianism art plays its just that s something that interesting me

3526848 with gas prices soaring and many of our employees traveling long distances to get to work we thought that it would be a great idea to offer our employees an alternative workweek schedule
3526849 not only will it cut down the costs of travel for employees who in essence will have an additional month off per year when you add up all the fridays that they dont have to work but it will also reduce operating costs at the 8484 wilshire boulevard building

3526891 the wall street journal recently did an article on failing etfs which hinted my view about them which is
3526892 no a trader is someone who makes a living trading ie needs to make money everyday and hence makes many trades daily
3526893 i guess im nosy do you care to share one such portfolio
3526894 i was not sure i wanted to order it unless it covered the tax aspects although am still mulling it over
3526895 etfs avoid irksome capital gain distributions through the clever use of exchanges in kind trades of mutual fund shares for securities in the fund with arbitrageurs because these trades are not taxable events etfs are typically able to rebalance their portfolios without realizing capital gains in effect etf shareholders are taxed as if the etf is just another security they pay taxes on dividends distributed by the fund but they are only hit with capital gain taxes when they sell their etf shares
3526896 the big advantage of etfs is that the sale of securities inside the fund does not typically generate taxable capital gains for etf shareholders investors in traditional open end funds must pay taxes each year on any net capital gains generated by trades inside the fund

3526903 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3526904 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3526905 i happen to disagree with them in regards to our film its a shame that they are out there and i hope that when it comes out they will actually see the jokes for what they are a deep cutting satire of hollywood and the stars
3526906 everyone has the right to protest its a free country anytime that anyone feels that they are justified in their heart more power to them
3526907 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscar
3526908 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards

3526943 the ferocity in which the actions of the georgian side were carried out cannot be called anything else but genocide because they acquired a mass character and were directed against individuals the civilian population peacekeepers who carried out their functions of maintaining peace
3526944 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict

3526961 vendors would offer me leftover produce i couldnt stand to see it go to waste so i would take it home and can it then i would give them a couple of jars and keep some for myself
3526962 canning is not my favorite thing to do but tomatoes are my favorite thing to have
3526963 most recipes instruct to remove it but either way they are going to be a little slimy
3526964 i keep a lot of what i can but i also trade with others and give some as gifts
3526965 i try to use as much local stuff as possible cloves and cinnamon are the only things not local in this
3526966 it didnt set but i found that i could mix it with plain yogurt and it was delicious
3526967 there are some things that are more difficult than others but if you follow directions you can pretty much do it

3526971 are you open now to having a vote for offshore drilling
3526972 we will have a vote its not strictly on offshore drilling well have a vote on an array of initiatives that will protect the consumer that will increase the domestic supply and that will reverse global warming and among those may be some restricting drilling in protected areas if they can comply with the three criteria that i mentioned
3526973 absolutely not the gimmick that the republicans have come up with drill drill drill in the protected areas and it will bring down the price of oil is a complete misrepresneation to the american people there are plenty of places weve had to drill at 68 million acres in the lower 48 where people can drill more than 10 million acres in alaska which are permitted for drilling
3526974 the lesson here for washington is that any modern conflict will include a cyberwarfare component simply because its too inexpensive to be passed up
3526975 the best defensive strategy is always preparedness weve spent eight years completely ignoring that while the chinese and indian governments have been paying really close attention and investing many tens of billions of dollars
3526976 if you look at how the routing is done on the internet there are a few major networks that are providing interconnectivity to everyone else
3526977 i dont see a cybertruce but im not seeing devastating effects as well
3526978 its obvious they are suffering from serious attacks but saying this is an internet war is blowing it out of any possible proportion before we have more information
3526979 you can bet that these attacks have cost georgias private sector far more than the perhaps 2 000 it cost the perpetrators to do them
3526980 and in the long run that loss of national productivity affects not only georgias financial ability to wage war but its peoples willingness to engage in it

3526987 are these folks so new to politics are they so arrogant that they think hes different from every other nominee weve ever had
3526988 when russia moved in on georgia john mccain stood up immediately and told them to get out
3526989 are these folks so new to politics are they so arrogant that they think hes different from every other nominee weve ever had
3526990 kos yang ditanggung oleh pts adalah sedekah kita semakin banyak kita bersedekah semakin maju bisnes kita
3526991 are these folks so new to politics are they so arrogant that they think hes different from every other nominee weve ever had
3526992 weve just seen over the last few days as the russians invaded a sovereign nation georgia and watch the response of this man

3526994 toluca tampoco ha tenido un buen inicio pero tiene grandes jugadores y est bien dirigido est n en su casa y es un partido muy atractivo en el que ellos van a querer empezar a sumar pero tambi n nosotros vamos con la ilusi n de llevarnos los tres puntos
3526995 queremos empezar a trascender queremos superar esa cuesta y comenzar a sumar puntos para salir del fondo del grupo que es complicado y que ahora estamos en el inicio pero que al final se pueden necesitar los que hemos dejado ir
3526996 el nemesio d ez es una cancha muy complicada no s lo para chivas sino para cualquier equipo porque toluca tiene un gran plantel grandes entrenadores y en los ltimos a os han marcado una poca interesante
3526997 the sec needs to get more relevant to the world its too slow in acknowledging the internet
3526998 theres nothing here that will change in any significant way what expert lawyers are advising their clients to do
3526999 for some lawyers and their clients its a helpful way of distilling things in one place
3527000 the commissions interpretive guidance seeks to open up the possibilities for innovation in this area by clarifying some of the legal issues surrounding the use of company websites it is my hope that you all will now step in roll up your sleeves and help companies to take the next steps in this area
3527001 i decided i wanted to write a book but not this particular piece i was going to try to go into relationships and that type of genre but i said i think no one else wants to hear that we have enough writers that do that
3527002 we had said before after he passed away that itd be nice to have it
3527003 i just came down to help a friend get his cattle back in theyd gotten out somewhere or another and we were going to try to fix the fence
3527004 it had been covered up with gravel and dirt and i dont know if the rain had washed out and they could see the blue shinning
3527005 i said youre not going to believe this its a miracle they have found travis class ring
3527006 its just another part of him that we can have
3527007 try to keep as much of the original show as possible im not trying to reinvent it
3527008 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3527009 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3527010 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3527011 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3527012 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3527013 if youre not involved in the sport im not sure you can fully appreciate it
3527014 he is way past anything you have seen he is incredible
3527015 i dont think michael will let his guard down until the last relay race
3527016 i dont think he has a comfort zone at all until the whole meet is over the whole olympic games he will not let his guard down because theres always someone out there
3527017 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps
3527018 theyve been resting all week and just gearing themselves up for one race where every time michael gets up on the block he has to gear himself up for his performance that night or that morning
3527019 when i lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3527020 is that what you plan to say on judgment day
3527021 is hard to put in a comedy but we had to do it
3527022 is vulnerable to adversaries who seek information about our nations homeland defense programs classified or unclassified
3527023 any real or possible contacts with foreign intelligence services terrorists or foreign criminal enterprises
3527024 the ausvet plan is very clear on what is required to prevent any further spread of this highly fatal disease in these cases human health and safety must come first
3527025 in the interests of protecting people and horses from further infection euthanasia is the most appropriate response
3527026 with labview 8 20 the combination of graphical programming and mathscript text based math provides a flexible and highly interactive approach to algorithm development
3527027 its nothing serious and he might have been ok to jump today but im not prepared to take the risk he is too important to me
3527028 sometimes we forget about them the rebels every day they say they are fighting for the poor people of darfur and yet what have they done to show even interest to go to the conference table
3527029 i am not in any way saying that the khartoum government is clean but what i am saying is that also the other side cannot be said to be saints so my appeal is that the pressure should be exerted on both sides
3527030 they will have to end on a negotiation table because militarily its clear no side can win the war in darfur
3527031 but if you have 15 20 parties wanting to go to conference table to talk nothing will come out of it
3527032 unfortunately we are sent to the boxing ring with our hands tied behind us
3527033 but we will try kickboxing if we cant do hand boxing
3527034 what does being born again mean to you can you explain it to someone who has never heard the term
3527035 while ad networks and their cousins ad exchanges offer an efficient way to unload inventory that would otherwise go unsold common complaints are that networks amount to paltry ad rates low rent ads and ultimately the threat of undermining a brands value

3527037 the only thing i carry is stis you fucking pussy
3527038 scientists are already seeing signs of changing occurring more quickly than they expected these signs range from high temperatures low rainfall drought and diseases leading to worsening economic conditions
3527039 the best local example that comes to mind is the recent power crisis our dear nation experienced
3527040 we need to drill here and we need to drill now
3527041 if i am elected president i will set this nation on a course to building 45 new reactors by the year 2030 with the ultimate goal of 100 new plants to power the homes and factories and cities of america
3527042 is using the environment as a way to portray himself as being different from george bush but the reality is that he isnt
3527043 the expansion of nuclear energy in the united states as a major component of our national energy policy
3527044 concerns over climate change suggest a larger role for nuclear power as an energy supply choice
3527045 the nuclear power 2010 program is working with industry to demonstrate the nuclear regulatory commission s new streamlined licensing process
3527046 in over 50 years of operating experience the nuclear industry still has not managed to solve the problems of safety security and disposal of highly dangerous radioactive waste
3527047 until that happens were much better off investing in safer cleaner energy sources such as renewable wind geothermal tidal and solar projects
3527048 ma perh palmiro non su quel sito di quei tipacci he sbavano per le strisce
3527049 the fate of biological diversity for the next 10 million years will almost certainly be determined during the next 50 to 100 years by the activities of a single species
3527050 the worlds remaining wild areas and the species in them are being pulverized and thats a multi layered tragedy
3527051 education and employment for women especially along with access to contraception and safe abortions are the most important components
3527052 the most basic response is to get going on stopping population growth and starting a decline second is doing something about consumption if you dont do anything about those then you are in trouble in all the others more people means more greenhouse gases which means more rapid climate change
3527053 its almost like reaching your sexual maturity at a younger age
3527054 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3527055 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
3527056 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
3527057 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
3527058 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3527059 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
3527060 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3527061 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3527062 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3527063 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3527064 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3527065 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3527066 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3527067 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3527068 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3527069 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades
3527070 before there was the internet and at the time i was at the justice department leading the prosecutions we could say with a fair amount of certainty that the number of people involved in child pornography in america was small and getting smaller
3527071 they then begin to trade child pornography with traders on the internet people who have collections however someone who has an extensive collection is not willing to give you that collection unless you can provide original material to that person
3527072 how do you get original material you begin to molest your neighbors kids maybe your own kids and your relatives
3527073 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3527074 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3527075 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3527076 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3527077 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3527078 just so you all know we did set a record
3527079 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3527080 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3527081 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3527082 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3527083 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3527084 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3527085 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3527086 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3527087 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3527088 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3527089 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3527090 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3527091 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3527092 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3527093 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3527094 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3527095 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3527096 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3527097 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3527098 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3527099 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3527100 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3527101 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3527102 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3527103 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3527104 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3527105 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3527106 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3527107 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3527108 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3527109 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3527110 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3527111 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3527112 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3527113 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3527114 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3527115 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3527116 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3527117 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3527118 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3527119 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3527120 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3527121 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3527122 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3527123 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3527124 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3527125 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3527126 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3527127 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3527128 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3527129 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3527130 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3527131 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3527132 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3527133 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3527134 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3527135 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3527136 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3527137 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3527138 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3527139 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3527140 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3527141 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3527142 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3527143 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3527144 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3527145 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3527146 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3527147 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3527148 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3527149 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3527150 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3527151 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3527152 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3527153 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3527154 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3527155 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3527156 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3527157 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3527158 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3527159 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3527160 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3527161 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3527162 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3527163 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3527164 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3527165 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3527166 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3527167 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3527168 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3527169 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3527170 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3527171 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3527172 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3527173 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3527174 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3527175 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3527176 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3527177 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3527178 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3527179 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3527180 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3527181 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3527182 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3527183 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3527184 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3527185 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3527186 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3527187 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3527188 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3527189 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3527190 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3527191 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3527192 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3527193 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3527194 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3527195 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3527196 yeah thats right im in line to buy a video game when it comes out at midnight but im not like
3527197 oh yeah the greg camarillo a bigger part of my life im all for
3527198 gee i have a young adrian peterson as my starting rb and a top 10 draft pick lets go with that stud 1st rounder rb out of ohio state
3527199 i have tom brady but lets spend our 2nd and 3rd round picks on qbs just to be safe
3527200 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3527201 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3527202 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3527203 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3527204 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3527205 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3527206 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3527207 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3527208 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3527209 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3527210 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3527211 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3527212 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3527213 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3527214 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3527215 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3527216 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3527217 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3527218 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3527219 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3527220 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3527221 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3527222 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3527223 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3527224 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3527225 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3527226 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3527227 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3527228 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3527229 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3527230 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3527231 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3527232 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3527233 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3527234 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3527235 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3527236 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3527237 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3527238 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3527239 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3527240 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3527241 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3527242 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3527243 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3527244 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3527245 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3527246 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3527247 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3527248 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3527249 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3527250 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3527251 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3527252 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3527253 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3527254 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3527255 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3527256 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3527257 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3527258 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3527259 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3527260 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3527261 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3527262 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3527263 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3527264 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3527265 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3527266 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3527267 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3527268 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3527269 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3527270 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3527271 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3527272 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3527273 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3527274 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3527275 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3527276 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3527277 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
3527278 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
3527279 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
3527280 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
3527281 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
3527282 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3527283 god uses fallen flawed people this doesnt invalidate what todd did
3527284 last week todd shared with me that his wife had returned to canada and hes following her this week ive been assured by his people that there is no third party involved
3527285 a large segment of the movement has been skeptical from day one theyre going to see this as a natural progression others who have been following todd are going to be spiritually shipwrecked weve most definitely seen through this revival a lot of people are not grounded in scripture so for them it wont be an issue
3527286 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3527287 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3527288 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3527289 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3527290 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3527291 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3527292 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3527293 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3527294 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3527295 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3527296 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3527297 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3527298 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3527299 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3527300 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3527301 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3527302 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3527303 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3527304 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3527305 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3527306 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3527307 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3527308 first rule of fight club dont talk about fight club
3527309 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3527310 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3527311 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3527312 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3527313 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3527314 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3527315 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3527316 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3527317 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3527318 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3527319 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3527320 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3527321 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3527322 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3527323 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3527324 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3527325 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word

3527328 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3527329 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3527330 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3527331 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3527332 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3527333 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3527334 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative

3527338 were recommending 1 000 ius daily because the current evidence suggests this amount will help reduce cancer risk with the least potential for harm
3527339 more research is needed to clearly define the amount of vitamin d that will maximize health benefits
3527340 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3527341 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3527342 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3527343 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3527344 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3527345 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3527346 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3527347 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3527348 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3527349 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3527350 ive decided to take you up on your offer the one to talk
3527351 oh good i mean id love to be of service i mean do you want to talk now over the phone
3527352 id rather not talk over the phone but i do want to talk now
3527353 all right then do you want to come over here do you need directions
3527354 all right ill come get you that is if you want to come over here or we can talk there
3527355 my roommate went home for the weekend so my room is the most private
3527356 i dont know im supposed to go back to school today
3527357 dont worry about that ill take you there myself after were done
3527358 ooh peter youre actually taking a girl into your room are you finally going to get some
3527359 id offer you the bed but i dont have a back rest and the beds all messy i just wouldnt feel right if you sat here
3527360 i bet you feel like youre being interrogated ill fix that for you
3527361 wait a minute god wouldnt tell you who to marry
3527362 but he chooses whos meant for us and makes sure we meet them at the right time he plans every detail of our lives
3527363 i dont believe anyone is meant for a person or that god plans every detail of our lives what career where to go to college whether to have sugar or a banana on your corn flakes it doesnt work logically because it doesnt fit in with free will it sounds too much like calvinism to me and lutherans dont like calvinism
3527364 to a certain extent but not to the extremes of some forms of calvinism we believe god chooses who will be saved but we dont believe he chooses who will be damned or every aspect of our lives
3527365 but no matter what well end up with that one person god knows who itll be
3527366 ive heard baptists say the same things youre saying we dont agree with baptists either
3527367 of course god knows who youll ultimately choose but he doesnt pick that person for us he doesnt force anyone on us whatever the case think about it if fate ultimately leads you to someone no matter what then where is free will and what about arranged marriages or times when a person marries divorces and never marries again ive heard about people looking for signs from god of who to marry it happens all the time dont feel like youre weird or anything lots of people want to know their future or get a huge blinking sign from god about what to do next but ive never heard of it working out either a person ends up with someone totally wrong for him or the other person never wises up and realizes theyre supposed to be together
3527368 but rev jarkin found out that way that he and becky were supposed to marry
3527369 and weve all seen what a wonderful marriage that has been or have we all do you know the story yet
3527370 ill tell you in a minute anyway one success out of many failures does not prove a rule i dont know if these words of knowledge and words of wisdom are real but i bet theyre not supposed to be used this way they sound like charismatic teachings im lutheran we dont like the teachings of charismatic churches
3527371 so you dont like calvinists or baptists or charismatics okay what else
3527372 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3527373 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3527374 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3527375 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3527376 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3527377 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3527378 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3527379 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3527380 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3527381 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3527382 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3527383 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3527384 lo so io non piaccio a te e tu non piaci a me
3527385 ho sentito dire che non sopravvive nessuno al suo passaggio
3527386 lei lei no non me lo dica mi lasci indovinare lei conte pacula
3527387 ah si volete la verit volete la verit voi non potete affrontare la verit
3527388 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
3527389 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
3527390 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
3527391 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
3527392 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3527393 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3527394 this wasnt the time or place to be making such statements
3527395 i think it was good and we both got something from it but i think we should go our separate ways and not look back like do it for real this time we spent enough time together to know its not going to be what we need it to be
3527396 ok to be a phony all that matters is youre beautiful
3527397 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3527398 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3527399 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3527400 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3527401 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
3527402 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
3527403 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3527404 i thought people would be honest enough to see me as a person who was trying to do something good and not as a celebrity
3527405 my mother always taught me say something good or say nothing at all
3527406 figment of the tabloid press i dont want that garbage in with the puppy story
3527407 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
3527408 we go to church and serve the lord and try to lead good lives and do good things
3527409 she is a person of note in our little community
3527410 the horse or the jockey evidence from nascent firms where a founder dies
3527411 an adjustment cost rather than a permanent drop in profitability
3527412 overall the results suggest that the entrepreneurs importance as a jockey to the nascent firm is quite limited
3527413 once firms are set up the founder seems to be substitutable
3527414 the results suggest that the founders role as a creator and visionary prior to the start up date is much more important than the role as a jockey
3527415 i sowwy sometimes he resorts to babytalk i didnt get it could you say it again

3527424 columbia pictures espionage thriller edwin a salt once expected to star tom cruise will be rewritten by screenwriter kurt wimmer as a star vehicle for angelina jolie reports variety philip noyce remains attached as director and lorenzo di bonaventura and sunil perkash are producing
3527425 jolie is close to a deal to play the title character a cia officer whos accused by a defector of being a russian sleeper spy and must elude capture long enough to establish her innocence
3527426 cruise had long flirted with the project but that ended recently the well regarded script had several male movie stars circling
3527427 jolie took a liking to it prompting the studios decision to rewrite it the trade adds that the project wont require that much of an overhaul to suit her
3527428 edwin a salt will undergo a title change and if everything falls into place the film shapes up as a return vehicle for jolie who recently gave birth to twins

3527431 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3527432 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3527433 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3527434 atletico punya tim yang baik namun kami harus melakukan yang terbaik untuk mendapatkan hasil maksimal
3527435 ini akan menjadi tugas berat bagi kami tapi juga ada peluang besar saya optimistis akan mampu melewati atletico
3527436 kami tahu akan menghadapi tim yang kuat seperti yang kami dengar schalke bermain garang setiap tampil di kandang dan mereka akan banyak menyerang maka kami harus terorganisasi dengan rapi dan mampu memanfaatkan peluang sekecil apa pun jika kami mampu mencuri poin maka pertandingan kedua di kandang akan lebih ringan
3527437 kami tak merasakan kompetisi ini begitu lama maka kami tak boleh menyia nyiakan kesempatan emas ini untuk berprestasi
3527438 aku kira peluang kedua tim 50 50 pasti akan terjadi pertarungan sengit tapi kami berharap mengambil keuntungan dari pertandingan itu
3527439 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3527440 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3527441 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3527442 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3527443 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3527444 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3527445 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3527446 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3527447 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3527448 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3527449 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3527450 we set our price where we think it was fair given all considerations of the various issues
3527451 we do what we think is appropriate in order to have 47 000 affordable seats we had to have 4 500 expensive seats
3527452 we were trying to produce revenue that would support our expenses and our debt service but also balance that against the realities that tickets were going to be going up for our customers we were going to deliver qualitatively a far far higher product for them
3527453 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3527454 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3527455 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3527456 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3527457 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3527458 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3527459 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3527460 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3527461 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general

3527467 she talked to sgt marquette and told him that i didnt want to go and thats it and marquette said that i had to go and if i didnt that id have a warrant for my arrest and i wouldnt be able to get no government loans or nothing like that so my mom doesnt really know anything about it so she believed it and she told me and i believed it too because i didnt know much about it either
3527468 this is what will happen you want to go to school you will not get no loans because all college loans are federal and government loans so youll be black marked from that as soon as you get pulled over for a speeding ticket or anything with the law theyre gonna see that youre a deserter then theyre going to apprehend you take you to jail you will do your time as you deserve all that lovey dovey i want to go to college and all this guess what you just threw it out the window because you just screwed your life
3527469 well have a warrant ok so give me a call back
3527470 negative administrative action just because someone has done something wrong doesnt mean that they get the death penalty

3527524 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3527525 as president mikheil saakashvili shuts down the opposition media he could well try to divert attention away from his political problems by ginning up a fresh conflict with the breakaway regions of abkhazia and south ossetia both of which are protected by russian troops and regional militias
3527526 saakashvili the great democrat is busy charging anyone who opposes him with being a pawn of the russians and therefore guilty of treason but the west is calling on him to restore civil liberties and in an apparent effort to propitiate his western benefactors he has lifted new elections widespread and growing opposition to his strong arm tactics even among many of his former supporters spells political trouble for saakashvili and his corrupt cohorts however and an appeal to georgian ultra nationalism which was always the real ideological motivation of the rose revolutionaries would bolster him in the polls and provide a much needed distraction at least from the ruling partys point of view
3527527 in the event of an outbreak of hostilities expect the u s to do what they have done for the duration of georgias political crisis proffer unconditional support to saakashvili with russia aiding and giving political and diplomatic support to the abkhazians and the ossetians and the americans letting loose a flood of military aid to tbilisi this could be the first theater of actual conflict in the new cold war
3527528 when violence broke out in the caucasus on friday morning john mccain quickly issued a statement that was far more strident toward the russians than that of president bush barack obama and much of the west but as russian warplanes pounded georgian targets far beyond south ossetia this weekend bush obama and others have moved closer to mccains initial position
3527529 obama accused russia of escalating the crisis through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3527530 the impact of russian actions goes beyond their threat to a democratic georgia russia has used violence against georgia to send a signal to any country that chooses to associate with the west and aspire to our shared political and economic values my friends we learned at great cost the price of allowing aggression against free nations to go unchecked
3527531 he wanted me to say thank you to you to give you his heartfelt thanks for the support of the american people for this tiny little democracy far away from the united states of america and i told him that i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
3527532 there is a depth of knowledge a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience that doesnt compare between the two
3527533 now is the time for action not just words it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a case fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3527534 you cant compare a 15 year historical record with three or four statements over the course of 15 months

3527549 its not making excuses its reality thats part of the game thats clearly our problem
3527550 if we need to add a top veteran pitcher well do that well do whatever we need to do next year well be extremely dangerous
3527551 the danger in this situation if i can be very blunt about it is that you say there have been 60 years of failure of negotiation and therefore its always going to fail whereas actually sometimes things arent like that and to be fair to this palestinian leadership as i keep emphasizing theyre living with the legacy of a certain type of politics and you dont escape from that immediately
3527552 we do not expect blairs role to be fair in any issue relating to the palestinian israeli conflict or any other arab related cause

3528041 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3528042 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3528043 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3528044 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3528045 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3528046 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3528047 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3528048 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3528049 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3528050 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3528051 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3528052 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3528053 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3528054 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3528055 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3528056 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3528057 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3528058 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3528059 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3528060 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3528061 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3528062 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3528063 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

3528071 i am committed to making australia the most asia literate country in the collective west
3528072 my vision is for the next generation of australians businessmen and women economists accountants lawyers architects artists film makers and performers to develop language skills which open their region to them

3528074 we should do some more long range strategy if we want to avoid being redundant
3528075 america is on the verge of a nuclear renaissance and texas is poised to play a central role
3528076 it is exciting to see firsthand the plans for the first new nuclear reactors in nearly 30 years i commend everyone at the south texas project for their leadership and look forward to all theyll do for the state of texas over the next decade
3528077 we cant afford 4 a gallon gasoline we cant afford higher electricity rates for our small businesses and our families we cant afford higher food prices that are caused by the higher transportation rates
3528078 all of it comes down to the price of energy we can do something about it we have the vast natural resources to solve this problem
3528079 right now in congress the majority leader of the senate and the speaker of the house are not allowing us to vote to expand our supply of energy which is the only way we will bring down the cost
3528080 im so pleased to be here because one of the key areas we can expand is nuclear power
3528081 we havent had expansions of nuclear power for over 40 years in this country and we have the capability to do it
3528082 if we are going to address the issue in congress in a balanced way it is going to be the expanded nuclear power plants expanded refineries
3528083 it is going to be drilling for our own natural resources and investing in a renewable energy that we know will have a great future but isnt quite where it needs to be yet to make the big difference
3528084 we know that technology is improving the capability to reuse the waste more and more that is a key factor there isnt as much nuclear waste as there was when these plants were started because we are able to use it more productively
3528085 we should rely on ourselves as america always has for our national security and our economic security by providing low cost efficient energy
3528086 im very pleased to be here at a plant that is showing the way
3528087 i dont want to make any announcements until next spring at least
3528088 im hoping running for governor will be the goal but were not quite sure yet where we are
3528089 ksl interview about six degrees from kevin bacon it worked
3528090 it is outrageous that a shipment of a highly toxic substance was allowed on board a passenger vessel we demand that del monte and the fertilizer and pesticide authority be made fully accountable for this unfolding chemical disaster the former for continuing the use of such highly toxic chemical and the latter for allowing multinational companies to use them despite the national prohibition and the scientific evidence of their toxicity
3528091 this pesticide has also been found to be highly toxic to birds fish and other aquatic organisms this is the reason why the philippines has severe restrictions on the use of endosulfan especially near or around bodies of water the m v princess of the stars disaster has now exposed that a multinational corporation like del monte is using tons of banned pesticides on their pineapples meant for export that it took a tragic disaster to expose another ongoing disaster is infuriating
3528092 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3528093 we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
3528094 i wish that i had followed it with all my heart

3528540 imagine if red hat released a version of linux and after it was deployed customers noticed that any processes with a start date of today would refuse to run well thats what happened to vmware a company that wants nearly all server applications running in virtual machines within a matter of years
3528541 police negotiators are also at the scene in a bid to bring the incident to a safe conclusion
3528542 the police intention remains to resolve the incident without harm to anybody involved these efforts are still ongoing
3528543 this was a particularly nasty incident and unusually a weapon was used against a member of the public which resulted in him receiving a stab wound to his stomach
3528544 the robbery took place during the lunchtime period and there would have been plenty of people in the area at the time
3528545 i would appeal to anyone who was in the area and may be able to help us with our inquiries to come forward as information they have could be vital
3528546 how much have your academic studies helped you in your work as a web designer developer
3528547 no lani im not going to ride the wet pink pony
3528548 this was the first tackling practice that we have had and it was a good go
3528549 we went through a pre practice and then 75 or 80 snaps with 50 live snaps there is some strong potential in this team but we are a ways away we are not smooth yet on offense or defense and we need to play smarter
3528550 as i look back on the last couple years this practice was virtually the same there is plenty of work to do but there was progress
3528551 we went 25 snaps on each team and then went special teams for an extended period
3528552 the special teams were all thud live except for tackling it was a pretty good go except for penalties turnovers and sloppy play it was great effort
3528553 andrew hatch handled the offense pretty well we ran the football well at times and the defense was sticky at times there were some good things but not necessarily the error free football that i am looking for
3528554 murphy had a couple of nice runs today and so did charles scott
3528555 those would be the two guys who carried the ball really well stevan ridley blocked a punt and looked like he made some plays
3528556 richard murphy had a couple of significant carries for 20 or 30 yards
3528557 charles scott had a couple carries for 20 or 30 yards andrew hatch broke one for 15 yards on a broken play and the young freshman quarterback broke one for about that 15 yards on a broken play
3528558 can we not have a common sense solution to this so that we have an encouragement to people to be volunteer firefighters
3528559 i think well have a plan here to fix this very soon

3528562 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3528563 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3528564 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3528567 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3528568 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3528569 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3528570 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3528571 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3528572 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3528573 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3528574 when people fear their government there is tyranny when the government fears the people there is liberty

3529001 he has certainly been subjected to an extensive assault which has caused significant bruising
3529002 at this stage we have no motive as to why these two people should be attacked with such brutality
3529003 sometimes the police hold news conferences like this and go through the motions with the media when they already have it in the bag but this really is an undetected homicide

3529005 modern parents are increasingly being influenced by fashions and celebrity
3529006 among the interesting discoveries i made was that two centuries ago the spread of names was very small perhaps 60 per cent of newborns had one of the top five most popular names for a boy or girl
3529007 a hundred years ago however there was almost as wide a distribution of names as there is today since lots of new names entered our lexicon during the victorian era
3529008 today there are even more new additions largely because britain has been a welcome home to immigrants so there are more names from ethnic minorities than ever before
3529009 we need to accept above all that we cannot guarantee to regenerate every town and every city in britain that has fallen behind just as we cant buck the market so we cant buck economic geography either
3529010 little prospect of offering their residents the standard of living to which they aspire
3529011 no doubt some people will claim these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy

3529016 i heard the wind wake everybody up so i went down to the campsite to check on the tents
3529017 everybody was fine but there was a dutch bloke whose tent had collapsed in the rain poor lad he went home this morning
3529018 at this time of year we should be chock full but look at it the motor homes and caravans are doing all right but bookings for tents are virtually non existent
3529019 when they tried to make their way back down the way they had gone up they were blocked by a river that was so badly swollen they could not get across if they had decided to try and get across the river it could have been nasty
3529020 i suppose i will have to get a new van

3529031 current expectations are for the global and u s economic environments to continue to be weak for capital markets to remain under stress and for a continued decline in u s housing prices
3529032 given the potential stress on the consumer from the continued downward pressure on housing prices and the elevated national inventory of unsold homes management remains extremely cautious with respect to the home equity mortgage and credit card portfolios
3529033 management expects continued deterioration in credit trends for the consumer portfolios which will likely require additions to the consumer loan loss allowance during the remainder of 2008
3529034 housing price declines in specific geographic regions and slowing economic growth continue to drive higher estimated losses and nonperforming assets for the home equity and subprime mortgage segments and have increasingly affected the prime mortgage segment due in part to the high concentration of more recent originations in this portfolio
3529035 based on managements current economic outlook quarterly net charge offs in the home equity portfolio could continue to increase during the remainder of 2008 prime and subprime mortgage net charge offs are expected to continue to rise significantly during the second half of 2008 with deterioration expected to continue into 2009 continued housing price declines could also lead to increases in non credit losses including losses on repurchases of previously securitized loans
3529036 the investment bank continues to be negatively affected by the disruption in the credit and mortgage markets as well as by overall lower levels of liquidity and wider credit spreads the continuation of these factors could potentially lead to reduced levels of client activity lower investment banking fees and lower trading revenue
3529037 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect

3529051 the premeditated slaying of john lennon with an essentially clear mind
3529052 your conduct thus precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals
3529053 your discretionary release at this time would thus not be compatible with the welfare of society at large and would tend to deprecate the seriousness of the instant offence and undermine respect for the law
3529054 geopolitical concerns always provide good support to oil prices and this news should offer some relief to investors worried about exports of azeri crude from ports in georgia
3529055 the strong recovery in the dollar adds more pressure to the sector which is already suffering from fears over slowing global growth
3529056 while not ready to call an end to this years bull market especially considering the murky outlook for chinese energy demand and continuing weather and geopolitical risks the agencys assessment of increased supply and inventories from june to july provides some fundamental justification for the sharp fall in benchmark crude prices in july
3529057 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement mr tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on

3529068 where you have a phobia youre getting a false alarm youre getting a strong hunch that something terrible is going to happen either to the bridge or to you or to the airplane or sometimes people say im not worried about the bridge its just me im going to have a panic attack
3529069 what im doing is devising coping strategies for a person to start practicing with me right in side my office and i have to find the ones that work for that given person everybodys different
3529070 its learning to shift out of a very certain feeling a very intense feeling
3529071 i can get across the bridge and even if i feel anxious doesnt mean that this is dangerous
3529072 people know how to ring up and make an appointment at their health clinic but they dont really know what to do about toxins in the air and global warming right
3529073 so the whole thing is how do we translate the tremendous amount of anxiety and interest in addressing major environmental issues into something concrete that people can do whose effect is measurable and significant
3529074 people are frustrated by their inability to cope with environmental problems in their apartments and their neighborhoods
3529075 provides a service thats needed educating people about what theyre up against and showing them that they can do something themselves while waiting for larger societal solutions
3529076 between popular culture and high art between art science and engineering
3529077 in a sense its performance in a sense its awareness raising and in a sense it empowers an audience to take action
3529078 i had it in a sample of water from the bronx river and unfortunately it died
3529079 so much of what environmentalism involves is things you shouldnt do and that can be very unsatisfying
3529080 had taken the prudent step of writing down the goodwill of its fresh dairy division by 170 million
3529081 this figure will not be tax effected in the fy08 accounts
3529082 the company anticipates that its full year dividend will remain unchanged at 13 5 cents per share
3529083 wed been looking for my husband for six weeks and this isnt how we wanted it to end at least we can close this
3529084 it hit me like a hammer that something needed to be done when i saw that
3529085 we know it will stand up in court so now is the time
3529086 we couldnt be out there 24 7 checking ids of people coming in and out of the park but if we got a call about a sex offender being in the park wed go take care of it
3529087 at this point i havent heard of any bad incidents about sex offenders in our parks but i think were setting a good precedent by being proactive rather than reactive
3529088 i dont care if we have 76 sex offenders or more than that i think we need to take this stance
3529089 im willing to do what it takes to make this law work
3529090 if we all have questions i think we should talk to people from other places we owe that much to the people of pender county

3529092 uncertainty and volatility in global credit markets will continue to place upward pressure on funding costs
3529093 we are cautious going into the new financial year and the group will continue with its conservative stance until signs of improvements in economic conditions are evident
3529094 the groups capital position is strong with capital levels well above target ranges
3529095 while these broad trends are clearly evident the duration and extent of the slowdown is more difficult to predict
3529096 there are clearly a number of negatives at work in the australian economy but it is important that we recognise there are potentially a number of positive influences
3529097 the balance of these opposing forces favours continued modest economic growth with credit growth not too far below the average of the past decade
3529098 while it is clearly a time to be cautious the current environment presents well managed banks like the commonwealth bank of australia with opportunities to grow even stronger
3529099 our robust financial position has enabled us to maintain the momentum behind our five strategic priorities and we remain committed to further strengthening our core businesses should attractive on strategy investment opportunities arise
3529100 i think what were seeing at this time in the marketplace is for strong financial institutions with plenty of capital there are opportunities there
3529101 and the price of assets is coming down but were not a buyer at high price
3529102 falling inflation suggests that the governments macro tightening measures have been effective which will both reduce investor fears of the possibility of policy missteps and increase the chances of a shift to targeted pro growth policies
3529103 the focus will now switch to the high cost of raw materials where prices remain elevated despite coming off recent peaks
3529104 as far as moving forward theres clearly work to be done but the chairman has called on his colleagues to go home for the august recess listen to what the constituents are saying and come back in september ready to come together on this tax relief bill
3529105 already companies are putting projects on hold and preparing to send thousands of jobs overseas real jobs that would otherwise be filled by american workers failure to extend the solar tax credits is a severe blow to an industry that has proven to be an economic engine for the u s at a time when we need it most
3529106 are clamoring for legislation that would bring down high gas prices
3529107 our strong second quarter results reflect continued momentum among our diverse set of businesses
3529108 we are encouraged by the robust revenue growth which we achieved despite the backdrop of a challenging economic environment
3529109 in light of our solid first half results and continued positive sales momentum across the company we are confident in confirming our full year revenue and margin outlook
3529110 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3529111 we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
3529112 i wish that i had followed it with all my heart
3529113 thought that they had not finished the investigation they hadnt considered all the evidence
3529114 im very grateful i survived this i didnt think i would
3529115 that secret church documents about these pedophile priests will be made public
3529116 suddenly this once republican town is voting democratic in off years
3529117 though the area is shifting to the democrats its still a very moderate area
3529118 the difference has been where the national democratic party has gone and to a certain extent the state parties
3529119 and the parking tickets who is the parking ticket nazi here
3529120 you know what the greatest part of that was they never once said anything they never booed until we became that team that was able to beat canada
3529121 when they got scared of us as a group playing against them thats when they started
3529122 that was a great feeling it really made me feel good
3529123 when you first start your career you wonder if youre ever going to play and then all of a sudden within the blink of an eye its over
3529124 i appreciated everything that usa hockey ever did because im not sure i ever would have been an nhler without the opportunity they gave me
3529125 there was a lot of proud guys in that locker room when i look back on it i still have that same feeling
3529126 it was probably the most talented team ive ever been around
3529127 it was one of my greatest moments in the game
3529128 i had never really been a champion id had a load of personal success but i had never really had any team success
3529129 after we won i remember standing on the blue line next to chris chelios and i asked him what i should do because i had never won before
3529130 the biggest change in hockey for women i noticed was when we returned from nagano in 98
3529131 i completely understand the financial constraints the airline industry is in but i also know the military traveler is an extremely small fraction of the total passengers carried
3529132 those who wear the uniform today are a special class of citizen who enables everyone else to enjoy every liberty our great country holds dear they deserve special treatment because they have earned it
3529133 what i am requesting is for your member airlines to begin allowing all military personnel traveling on orders to check a third bag without being charged
3529134 this should not be a difficult decision to reach but it is one that needs to be made
3529135 long and proud history of supporting our nations military men and women
3529136 they routinely offer special fares for military personnel and families attempt when possible to accommodate unplanned schedule changes and generally seek to do what they can to show their appreciation
3529137 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
3529138 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
3529139 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
3529140 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
3529141 the right to swing my fist ends where the other mans nose begins
3529142 they were the ones that sat and listened while you ranted about how hes mistreated you and disappointed you and makes sure youre okay when really the reverse happens and youd rather be out somewhere with the boy that initially disappointed you so
3529143 ill make my own money and ill make my own rules
3529144 they dont bother me ive got 2 babies of my own ones 36 ones 23 huh its hard to believe but youre gonna miss this youre gonna want this back youre gonna wish these days hadnt gone by so fast these are some good times so take a good look around you may not know it now but youre gonna miss this
3529145 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3529146 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3529147 the territorial integrity and belonging of south ossetia and abkhazia to georgia can never be put under doubt
3529148 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3529149 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3529150 you have the right to freedom and independence we are here to demonstrate our solidarity freedom is worth fighting for
3529151 this country russia seeks to restore its dominance but the time of dominance is over
3529152 our visit is a sign of the solidarity of our five countries with the georgian nation which has been a victim of aggression
3529153 people often talk about this as the internet service revolution
3529154 that will eventually lead to machines that have lots of server capacity lots of low cost computing low cost storage and that will let us write software in an even more ambitious way eliminating the last constraints we have
3529155 to encompass all interactive techniques the touch the speech the vision
3529156 because theyre fairly developed in the labs i can say that in 10 years will be widespread
3529157 you might get artificial intelligence or robotics but those are still so undeveloped at least in terms of widespread impact
3529158 it really is a milestone i think and shows the world this opportunity to all work together and how places like hong kong and china will be such an important part of the future
3529159 whether its software or energy or agriculture the promise of science is much greater than ever before and thats why im so optimistic
3529160 no you cant do anything about the things you cant control
3529161 you just work on the things you can control and officials are something you cant control you just hope they have a good game
3529162 some of the onus has to fall on us too as the players
3529163 and youve got to look at the ref seventeen un awarded penalties thats bullshit
3529164 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3529165 yo parents you arent doing your jobs by raising kids in the best fashion
3529166 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3529167 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3529168 eww pox upon you and your small e penis family
3529169 sams family is jewish lindsay has learned a lot about judaism from sam and admires its beliefs
3529170 i doubt it two years ago it was kabbalah last year it was aa she was into peace for a while whatever is of the moment thats lindsay
3529171 but the one thing it does show is her commitment to sam she could be any religion and lindsay would be open to it
3529172 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true
3529173 i dont know about you all but cash and i have been glued to the olympics
3529174 the mens 400m relay was insane cash and i went crazy
3529175 the shot of michael phelps after the race ended cheering with his teammates is so memorable the last time i got this excited watching sports was when baron davis was in the nba playoffs
3529176 if you arent in the best shape of your life and training every day to make the next olympics i highly recommend checking out the iby living room olympics
3529177 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3529178 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3529179 in san francisco we run the risk of losing the entire black population
3529180 there should be emergency hearings because this is an emergency
3529181 african americans in san francisco lag behind the rest of the city in almost every key economic indicator and face significant barriers to addressing the disparities
3529182 this is a city that still has a problem with discrimination and many of the things we are talking about are the result of discrimination
3529183 every organization that has anything to do with eliminating discrimination has been underfunded understaffed and underrecognized
3529184 in the end the only thing that matters is what you think of yourself
3529185 my name is ozymandias king of kings look on my works ye mighty and despair

3529190 tiens pourquoi pas poster quelques critiques de mon webzine ici
3529191 between these two candidates you have one john mccain who has become one of the most successful productive senators in recent years because hes consistently reached across party lines to get things done
3529192 in the three and a half years barack obamas been in the senate with all respect theres very little evidence of that bipartisan outreach
3529193 he is an iconic figure for dissidents and reformers around the world he seeks out their company and they seek his inspiration
3529194 its degrading to have someone who just hired you to stick his hands down your pants
3529195 why didnt you turn around and knock him out right there
3529196 i knew what i was there for to pay my part of the bargain
3529197 gt slide co prime line s 4629 bath tub toy storage net suction white nylon
3529198 that the administration is trying to push such sweeping rollbacks on their way out the door alarmed but not surprised
3529199 heavily involved with editing commenting on and reshaping the endangered species programs scientific reports from the field
3529200 the law itself says its supposed to use the best scientific and commercial data available
3529201 this new rule is really cutting out the involvement of fish and wildlife service biologists
3529202 i think the real point here is that with the agencies doing the projects their main goal is to do the projects
3529203 so they may have some biologists on staff but those biologists would be doing such a broad scope of different species theres no specialization there specialization in species thats what the fish and wildlife service and the national marine fisheries service are for
3529204 rather than anything with any meaningful protections for our wildlife
3529205 take any sort of objective science based decisions and take them out of the hands of experts and put them into the hands of political appointees
3529206 this is the worst kind of fox guarding the hen house scenario
3529207 we think theres still going to be that oversight on projects that really have the potential of having an adverse impact to wildlife
3529208 theyre going to be held liable in any case for their decision
3529209 anybody could take them to court and a court could rule that they did not carry out their responsibilities correctly
3529210 groups scream that we are quote unquote gutting the endangered species act thats just not the case the act is more than 20 years old the position that some people are taking is that its a perfect act and that it needs no changes
3529211 the campaigns are taking center stage so its an opportunity to get something through that with public scrutiny would not have gotten through before
3529212 i would assume that the conservation community would likely take them to court
3529213 since the supreme court was prevented by the illegal removal from office of judges who refused to take oath under pco from ruling on the validity of general musharrafs election in october 2007 we support the governments decision to impeach him under article 47 of the constitution and call upon the government to bring these proceedings to a speedy conclusion
3529214 and we certainly have work to do things to fix fences to mend
3529215 we know how to operate and we continue to support the joint team in iraq and afghanistan
3529216 we will return the vigor and the rigor to all the processes and missions for which we have been entrusted
3529217 and the united states air force will remain the finest air force on the planet
3529218 and expect to address several of them both in the immediate term and the longer term within the next month or two
3529219 so well be able to take input from the schlesinger panel then take about another 30 days to work out our roadmap

3529445 so it will probably take no less than 8 years and no more than 12 years before you get to that level that we have seen with the prius hybrid
3529446 whether it starts to take off in a serious way towards big time depends a lot on whether we see good ways to produce hydrogen that fit our future energy strategies
3529447 people are working hard on these questions but its going to hover at the modest level for quite a while before we get a sense of whether this is ready for big time

3529450 attacking left wingers and police officers with an aggression that can be seen as a change in strategy
3529451 before neo nazis largely avoided violence for tactical reasons but this no longer appears to be the case
3529452 i see a new character above all after the riots on 1 may in hamburg
3529453 wow what a great effort we can push harder though did jimmy ask you to prom by the way that barette is so cute do you think justin timberlake is watching us oh my god oh my god oh my god
3529454 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3529455 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3529456 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3529457 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3529458 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation

3529470 they both unloaded on me and i started seeing stars and the whole thing was just bam bam bam after that
3529471 someone had a chokehold and they were all on top of me and i couldnt breathe and i thought i was going to die
3529472 i didnt know my teeth were broken until i was spitting out loose pieces
3529473 the thing that kind of made everybody gasp was when the officer took the back of the guys head and shoved it to the ground on his face
3529474 had i not been rolling the camera and no one else was rolling the camera it might have just been swept under the rug
3529475 was there a point at which somebody slammed his face into the ground
3529476 when you start seeing that the officers are making arguments that are directly contradicted by this videotape it raises questions about how believable the police officers are
3529477 i never saw the bicyclist make any sort of swing at either of the officers
3529478 the investigation is underway and no conclusions should be drawn until all of the facts are available and the totality of the circumstances can be considered
3529479 everyone in our country is initially entitled to a presumption of innocence even police officers
3529480 is this a great power that lives by the conventions of the world as it exists in the 21st century
3529481 the most extreme option would be occupying georgia a country with a population of 4 4 million and a centuries old distrust of russia

3529486 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3529487 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3529488 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3529489 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3529490 velvet revolvers new album will draw heavily on their messy split with scott the band wanted a big name who could easily hold his own and reckon lenny is just the man for the job

3529498 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3529499 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3529500 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3529501 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3529502 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3529503 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3529504 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3529505 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3529506 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3529507 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3529508 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3529509 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3529510 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3529511 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3529512 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3529513 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3529514 if we dont do this wheres the industry in 10 years
3529515 it was absolute excitement shock in the utmost of wattage
3529516 it was just so unexpected it was so clear that the french were going to win this race and it was like a switch was flipped and lezak pulled it out
3529517 she was conscientious to the point of doggedness and delivered quality reports on time she had a quality of making other people think that they were funny and clever and a knack of getting them to do her bidding
3529518 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3529519 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3529520 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3529521 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3529522 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3529523 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3529524 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3529525 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3529526 who are open to doing something on the production side
3529527 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3529528 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3529529 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3529530 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3529531 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3529532 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3529533 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3529534 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3529535 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3529536 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3529537 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3529538 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3529539 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3529540 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3529541 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3529542 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3529543 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3529544 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3529545 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3529546 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3529547 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3529548 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3529549 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3529550 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3529551 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3529552 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3529553 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3529554 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3529555 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3529556 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3529557 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3529558 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3529559 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3529560 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3529561 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3529562 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3529563 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3529564 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3529565 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3529566 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3529567 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3529568 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3529569 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3529570 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3529571 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3529572 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3529573 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3529574 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

3529577 im not lucid right now im saying funny things give me a half hour and ill talk
3529578 everything has been done out in the open i have a reputation i do not want the fans of cleveland or honest caring people to think that i cheated
3529579 lets go to the bathroom so i can see it and see if we can fix it
3529580 dont let them see you google things that may be stuck in my butt

3529593 well ive been stressed so i deserved to smoke some pot
3529594 we will return the vigor and the rigor to all the processes and missions for which we have been entrusted
3529595 so well be able to take input from the schlesinger panel then take about another 30 days to work out our roadmap
3529596 i wouldnt want to speculate on the organizational structure that comes out of this what i can promise you is that were taking a comprehensive look at this issue so this is not onesies and twosies and a handful of fixes this is across the board
3529597 my pledge to all today is that the will keep the promise to our teammates and to our families and to all our partners who rely on us every day
3529598 that trust is critical is born from expertise respect for our joint partners and rigorous accountability we will work together to reinvigorate the
3529599 we all have family and friends who have failed to receive the good news of the gospel

3529610 society demands that we succeed in this challenge that we end police corruption
3529611 for weeks i have held my tongue but after this mornings washington post story no longer this makes me sick this circular firing squad must stop
3529612 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3529613 theres nothing wrong with me and ive been living in the area for 40 odd years
3529614 if they want me to move theyll have to put me in chains and throw me in the back of a paddy wagon police van
3529615 but its the psychological battle that theyre playing burying things in front of us that were part of our town they want to pretend the place never existed
3529616 we do camp cooking outside at night its like an alternative lifestyle and theres no rules sometimes we have the town to ourselves its like living on an island
3529617 these are people who parachuted in after the mine closed and bought a house for nothing seeking to profit from the notoriety of wittenoom
3529618 now we are protecting both the tourists and the ancient monuments
3529619 go away the police told us not to talk to you
3529620 now i dont know if i will be here tomorrow i have five children a wife what will happen to us
3529621 two years from now you wont see them inside the site
3529622 i dont know what it was like before but i feel very comfortable and secure
3529623 we are fully engaged with biofuel as they work their way through this
3529624 could europe be involved in a peacekeeping mission europe is available to do that of course
3529625 we left when the shelling started we dont have food
3529626 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3529627 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
3529628 thinks that old times will come back but that time is over
3529629 these guys are survivors yet here they are in our time when more than 40 percent of amphibians around the world are threatened
3529630 all these different factors are leading to their decline and its really really serious weve been finding dead frogs by the hundreds and thousands
3529631 if you ran into a problem where you really were concerned about something and wanted to do detailed scientific analysis these rules would make it much harder to do that
3529632 the endangered species act has evolved into something that is less concerned with helping species and more concerned with exerting economic control and holding up or sometimes stopping important economic activity

3529639 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3529640 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3529641 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3529642 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3529643 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3529644 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3529645 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3529646 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3529662 we think that it will be a big issue in an election campaign
3529663 we think that a real plan for the north needs to include more than military spending the conservatives forget the cold war is over
3529664 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3529665 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop
3529666 thats whats at stake when russia engages in behavior that looks like its from another time
3529667 they need to think about whether they havent achieved some tactical objectives at the expense of some strategic objectives
3529668 morgan tsvangirai is the main opposition leader and any agreement that doesnt include his party will not work for the country it actually just complicates issues
3529669 we and the mdc headed by mutambara have signed the agreement tsvangirai did not sign the agreement because he is basically trying to take us back to renegotiate issues that we had already agreed on
3529670 we are proceeding and the president mugabe is going to form a government of national unity including members of the opposition

3529676 yesterday s story in the wall street journal fails to make the distinction between corporate credit unions which serve other credit unions and natural person credit unions which serve individuals in addition in several instances the term big is arbitrarily substituted for corporate in the article
3529677 it is important for the public to understand that corporate credit unions investments are limited to the most highly rated securities also natural person credit unions otherwise referred to as regular credit unions in the article are demonstrating solid fundamentals especially by contrast with other federally insured institutions like banks
3529678 as stated in yesterday s article credit unions are among the most conservatively run financial institutions in the u s and because of their traditional practices credit unions are managing well in this economic climate the recent development for corporate credit unions as also noted in the feature is just another indication that almost no financial sector is immune from the current economy
3529679 unlike other financial depository institutions credit unions under the supervision of the national credit union administration ncua which is responsible for overseeing the national credit union share insurance fund ncusif have never cost the taxpayer one dime

3529689 how do i avoid drawing attention to my finger instead of my thumb
3529690 in the absence of jamie dwyer and bevan george they really showed the level of play they are capable of
3529691 i do not know if that 6 1 win is a message to other teams but i think we definitely try to come out playing an attacking style
3529692 barbarians look this is georgian democracy if it werent for russia we would already have been buried here
3529693 i saw a georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children
3529694 the young men ran but the women and the infirm who could not leave were shot like dogs
3529695 we managed to get them away but this is a terrible loss of a very talented life
3529696 georgi was one of our best young doctors he could have left but chose to stay behind to do his job and help the sick we are a hospital and we would treat anyone georgian russian we are here to save all human life i dont know why they chose this place the outside world should be told what is going on here
3529697 i was actually inside with my son when this happened there was a huge noise and the place caught fire we were thrown across the room my son could have died
3529698 anyone who could have got away has done so but i had nowhere to go and now i do not even have anywhere to live it was the russians and ossetians who did this i will never forgive them
3529699 they are using the russians to murder our people they have chosen to be our enemies they want to take over our lands but we shall get revenge for what has been done
3529700 he has led us into this war we could not win
3529701 and he must now bear the responsibility he has let us down and he now must go
3529702 the first thing is that the whole event is very undesirable in terms of both the domestic situation in jammu and kashmir and its linkage with the larger bilateral peace process between india and pakistan
3529703 i think this will have a bad impact and considering that pakistan is going through bad turmoil now the overall impact on the peace process will not be very positive
3529704 sheikh azizs death is big loss to the kashmir nation we will take his mission to its logical end
3529705 our struggle for complete independence from india will continue no power on earth can deter us from achieving this
3529706 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interest first
3529707 the girl appearing on the picture must be flawless in terms of her facial expression and the great feeling she can give to people we had to make that choice it was fair to both girls we combined the perfect voice and the perfect performance
3529708 since this happened seven year old kids all think you should judge a person according to his or her image
3529709 they now think that being good looking is better than having a good voice shame
3529710 personal image can have an effect on a country and a negative image is not in the national interest what a joke why dont they just cancel the programme dont relate everything to the national interest
3529711 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3529712 the aggressor has been punished and has suffered very considerable losses
3529713 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them so you have to use surgery
3529714 all nationalities together in georgia the armenians the azeris the georgians and the ossetians we will be together we will win together we will win
3529715 we will never surrender and we will tell this to the enemy thousands and thousands of times
3529716 we are a nation of warriors and we will fight until the end we will destroy the russians and retake gori well drive them out of south ossetia and well take back abkhazia as well onwards
3529717 i and a lot of my friends used to be against him
3529718 but hes our president we elected him and if we dont like him well remove him ourselves without russia this war has made georgia united
3529719 the situation is very difficult in the country i think that there is no time for internal political disputes
3529720 under such conditions it is an unwritten law internal political confrontations and disputes should be stopped
3529721 i have only a few memories he left when i was five or six it is really a shock
3529722 he was trying to get into the acting business and he thought it was a more appropriate name
3529723 its going to be hard to prove anything because hes not left any permanent trail
3529724 i was suspicious from the first time i heard that he was related to the rockefeller family
3529725 the way he wore the name on his sleeve in a gloating kind of way seemed unusual
3529726 this defendants efforts to avoid identification are simply too extensive for us to take anything at face value one thing we are certain of this defendants true name is not clark rockefeller
3529727 the police and military need to act differently their faces look like they are made of stone

3529781 we hope the israeli side will stick to the agreement to continue negotiations away from the media and not to begin engagement in the blame game

3529783 sure its my garden but i didnt set it up so youd show up i have no idea where you came from for all i know youre just a guy who showed up one day and buried himself up to the neck in my garden if you think that means im going to take care of you you need to think again im a libertarian
3529784 dont look at me youre just there there you are and i didnt put you there you put yourself there
3529785 i didnt put myself here i just grew here i woke up this morning and here i am i dont have any control over where i am im just here
3529786 you mean to tell me that youre just a head that popped out of the ground this morning and here you are speaking english with me and im supposed to believe that is that what youre telling me
3529787 well as improbable as that sounds thats obviously what the case is dont you think
3529788 like i said for all i know youre just some guy pulling a prank who buried himself in my garden up to the neck and now youre messing with my head theres no rule saying ive got to believe anything you tell me
3529789 well ill say this then go ahead and dig the dirt around my neck and see whats under the ground go ahead if theres arms and legs and everything else down there ill just get up and go and youll never see me again
3529790 no im not falling for this craziness you understand thats all i need the neighbors to see me digging in the dirt around a talking head with a black moustache ill be the laughing stock the minute i get down in there and see a shirt you know the joke is over
3529791 right look im making myself a sandwich im taking this lettuce inside and im putting it on a bun with my salami and ham and cheese and im going to eat it and my suggestion to you is by the time i come out here again probably tomorrow morning to water the garden id be gone and on my way anyway thats what i would do if i were you because ill tell you right now im not going to put up with this prank for too long funs fun but if youre not out of here by the morning im calling the police and then well see whats what
3529792 im telling you i cant i dont have any arms and legs like you i just grew here is all wait come back
3529793 i was buried in a garden just like you are except i was only buried up to my waist and i could still move my arms in fact i was nice and warm in a blanket
3529794 well lucky you im just a head coming out of the ground talking to you and you didnt believe me yesterday but here i am still so now what are you going to do
3529795 you know there was a skunk went through here late last night and it gets cold just on top of black dirt like this theres a kind of soupy dew that just hangs there at the base of all the plants in here youve probably never noticed it before
3529796 so i ask you if im not what i say i am i mean if im some prank what am i doing still here totally familiar with what night is like in your garden
3529797 well wait just a minute anybody can make up anything about what happens in a garden over night i mean you could just assume things that happen in a garden at night and a person probably wouldnt be too far off i mean come on skunks and dew anybody can come up with that
3529798 nevertheless theres nothing i can do to prove to you there was a skunk in here last night but rub the hair on top of my head and see for yourself about the dew
3529799 no theres no way im rubbing your head no in fact ive got to water the vegetables now and what the hell am i supposed to do with you in there like that
3529800 well i am feeling a bit thirsty just water all around me and try not to get anything on my hair i have a feeling im susceptible to morning rot if i get too wet in the cool air plus i dont want to attract leaf miners
3529801 i dont ever use harsh chemicals to keep the bugs down i just usually use soap and water do you mind
3529802 it should be ok just give me some fair warning ok i mean just let me know its coming
3529803 oh no problem probably just before noon before it gets hot
3529804 yes ok if im asleep just wake me up alright i dont want to open my eyes when you just start with the soap
3529805 its hard for me to say i dont know how to answer your question i just am i dont know where i came from or how i got in this form and i have no idea what lies in the future for me im just here i exist thats all i can honestly say is true so why worry about it
3529806 lots of people struggle with where they came from and where theyre going i mean in the human world theres whole industries built around helping people answer those kinds of questions
3529807 lots of different reasons i suppose everybodys motivation is probably different
3529808 well i dont get it what would be different if everybody knew what life was all about i mean you say all these people humans are going around trying to find out where they came from and where theyre going and if they found out what would change really
3529809 im not sure but i think there would maybe be less strife between people
3529810 im just guessing but it seems to me that if the whole story of what were doing here and what it all means ever becomes known i guess people would be happy a lot of questions would be answered for a lot of people and maybe everybody would calm down i really dont know
3529811 whatever you say you know more about your kind than i do thats for sure its not for me i just am i guess
3529812 well its like for instance do you have any memories
3529813 i seem to remember a feeling like i was in a cold dark place and stuff was crawling on me but i wasnt really uncomfortable or anything seemed natural actually but its just a fuzzy kind of memory nothing i can be sure about i dont think i have a visual memory of it or anything outside of that not much first thing i remember seeing was that green tomato over there on the bottom branch of that tomato plant
3529814 i just dont understand this at all something tells me im like dreaming or something because this just doesnt happen
3529815 look i promise you im here i really am here alright weve kind of been through this already you know i mean we can go over it again if you want
3529816 i mean it must be very hot in the sunshine with a beard and all
3529817 im fine a beards a beard what else are you supposed to do with it
3529818 i know lots of guys who trim it in the summer to keep themselves cool in the heat
3529819 um i dont think that would be a good idea
3529820 would you cut the leaves off these tomato plants because it was too warm
3529821 ow you bastard get off of ow get away get a ow
3529822 well let me look at it you fool maybe i can help get back here and let me see

3529837 i heard the way you said that all day and all night like im some kind of helpless little kid one split second more and i would have chomped that crows head off and all my troubles would have been over you know
3529838 im certain of it i agree im not laughing at you honest
3529839 but im still going to have to get a cover for you because i mean what if he comes back at night and you dont see him in the dark until its too late he looks pretty crafty to me
3529840 im not saying thats not a good idea i just dont want you thinking im helpless down here lifes a lot tougher down here than i think you give me credit for im not a rookie over here you know im adapted to this i was born to it
3529841 let me just get my stuff and well get you all set up
3529842 ill bet you that crow is watching us right now
3529843 i bet hes watching what youre doing and just working over whats going on i can feel it
3529844 he wont be able to figure this out and ill tell you another thing im going to make it so that it will stick into the ground and ill set some rocks around a flattened edge so that he wont be able to get it off of you just in case
3529845 well actually im kind of thinking of having it there whenever im in a different part of the yard
3529846 i mean its a good idea and all but im in like jail now
3529847 what else can i do when im doing something in another part of the yard ive got to cut grass in a day or so what are you going to do when im in the front of the house
3529848 oh theyre pushy creatures alright you should see what goes on under the surface in the root systems farmers and gardeners have every right idea about them selfish bastards all of them its like their roots act like magnets or something so dont let me stop you please carry on by all means you just looked particularly intense in doing it thats all
3529849 i do im sorry i mean yes i suppose i am a bit single minded today sometimes weeds are a chore and the only way through it is just to get down there and get to work
3529850 some of these vegetable are nearing the end of the line i guess
3529851 well as a matter of fact youre exactly right pretty soon these tomatoes will have run their course and i put the carrots in early enough so that i could really start pulling them any time now of course the lettuce is all eaten up
3529852 well i cant say it isnt something that hasnt occurred to me i have to tell you i have no idea ive never done this before
3529853 you see thats what im talking about you sitting there suggesting strawberries in next years garden even though i cant for the life of me determine where you even get the knowledge that there are such things and then you look at me as bold as you please and tell me you have no idea what happens to you come this fall you talk to me about things you could never have experienced as if its stuff youve known about for years and years naming things correctly as nice as you please and you swear like a sailor and put sentences together that are intelligent and understandable even though youre only a couple months in this world and then you tell me you dont know what your fate is im sorry i am just having a very difficult time processing this whole thing right now
3529854 just for the record i cant understand how i know things either i just seem to know them not sure how that works this is all new to me too so that you know all i know is here i am im completely here in the present and i dont question what i know any more than i have a desire to claim to know things i dont know i know a lot about things but i dont know whats to become of me do you
3529855 do you know how your life is going to end do you know what happens after you die
3529856 well im pretty sure its a heaven or hell thing isnt it
3529857 who knows i mean it who actually knows its a pleasant guess it could be so it be not so it could be something no one had ever thought of it could be anything or it could be nothing but nobody actually knows not really not until it happens and theres no going back right
3529858 ok i can see that sure we have an idea but its a matter of faith sure
3529859 yet you know theres other people in the world thousands of miles away going along with their lives even though youve never seen them right
3529860 so its the same with me i dont know how i know things but i know them i dont ask why or how but as to what happens at the end of my time i can only guess just like you
3529861 yes but i know things because of experience ive read about things or ive gone to school and learned about them where do you get your experience from
3529862 see i dont ask that question you telling me how youve learned things is a place where i dont go its not an easy concept i know but i just dont go there i know what i know i dont know how i know it but i also know that there are things i dont know about how is it you never ask how i know that
3529863 i feel as though i have had a very long and full life

3529873 i dont know if there is any other vehicle or any other technology that has generated this kind of interest because of the state of the market and gas prices
3529874 we are rolling back the transportation clock 30 years airlines are toast people think nothing about flying somewhere for the weekend to their second home for instance to them cheap fares are a birthright no more
3529875 imagine just two or three at most instead of 400 discount fares to fly from coast to coast think 800 or 900
3529876 an evening in commemoration of rocking your goddamn face off
3529877 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
3529878 well i only fill up enough for my self now
3529879 half the people who come up here smoke ciggarettes so its going to kill the customers business base and hurt business so i dont understand why they need to pass a law especially since sullivans island mount pleasant and charleston already has a smoking ban
3529880 weve got so much water around here its a desirable place to live and to visit not only with the water but the historical landmarks
3529881 youve got things that i think will appeal to the historical tourists but also the things that will appeal to families that kind of diversity is not offered everywhere else
3529882 the hardest thing weve had is to try to figure out what to do we pick up all of the pamphlets we investigated online all the things and its hard to do everything charleston has to offer in a couple days
3529883 theres a lot of different things here something for everybody
3529884 they loved her and they loved being in her class
3529885 what was so remarkable was she knew everyone little one of their personalitys she knew who needed help with math and who needed help with language arts
3529886 at first i was so angry so made because she had so many more years left in her but in the same token i had to step back and say look at all she has done to this point how many lives shes touched

3529900 global warming has now got to the stage where it is only maintained by media self censorship if the general public ever got to know of the scandals surrounding the no detectable warming for the last decade the whole movement would be dead in the water but they dont so it isnt it has become the most powerful myth in human history sending much of the world into a downward helix of economic decline it is a tenuous hypothesis supported by ill found computer models and data from botched measurement dubiously processed
3529901 now you know how i felt when they brought you home
3529902 you can cut holes in the fences around the death camps
3529903 a trickle of relief in the abortion holocaust it is your duty to do it
3529904 i would be very surprised if there was anything like that in sedano s history because the judges are very very careful about that sort of thing
3529905 father joes blog is great fun to read too bad i will have to strike him dead with lightning some day

3529908 this infidel priest is not funny and is ill informed
3529909 he is a right wing bigot who is anti choice and anti woman the goddess is not happy with his blog
3529910 he is the poorest priest i know always pontificating about things he knows nothing about he is a disgrace
3529911 the invasion is going as planned and soon all the clergy will be pod people from outer space starting with father joe

3529915 i write my best while at home dressed in my tuxedo smoking a pipe drinking a 18 year old single malt scotch and while being massaged in my ergonomic chair by only the most skilled swedish masseurs stronger hands than their female counterparts i feel most comfortable not doing the writing myself instead just dictating to my ridiculously british secretary hence the british accent to my writings i make my secretary use only the finest fountain pen filled with ink made from a rare blossom found only in albania the ink has a certain imbued lightness that i find really captures the written word its costly sure but you cant beat the results
3529916 oh i see but what about the drivel youve been putting out lately how do you write
3529917 every boy needs a good donkey but you cant have mine suzies last blog

3529921 the most compelling evidence of all for the effectiveness of safe sex is the simple fact that when safe sex was taken on by men who have sex with men msm the escalation in infection rates was pegged back
3529922 this made it immediately clear that the risk of hiv infection was not associated with male to male sex per se rather it was associated with unsafe male to male sex
3529923 dont send the cow pies im trying to lose weight and there is no way thats gonna happen with a big ole box of chocolate from mama wanda sittin on my desk
3529924 whats hard is simple whats natural comes hard maybe you can show me how to let go lower my guard learn to be free maybe if you whistle whistle for me
3529925 instead of regulators shielding insurance companies from the consequences of harming patients we need criminal prosecutions of insurance executives and tough new rules protecting innocent patients
3529926 patients who receive these notices may be hoodwinked into forgoing their legal rights under class action lawsuits which are likely to provide better results what patients dont know is that the fine print of the dmhc settlements fails to limit how much insurers can charge for new health coverage and stacks the legal deck in favor of insurers over unpaid medical bills
3529927 the bottom line companies use microsoft patterns and practices to make their development environments more productive consistent and standardized whether used by an independent software vendor consultancy or enterprise patterns and practices can accelerate project cycle times reduce costs and shift application development efforts away from code building and toward maximizing business benefits
3529928 surely you dont have to do this surely you dont have to tell the target service which activity you want it to talk to next
3529929 we need incentives tax credits and subsidies that are in place for a much longer time so theres less uncertainty
3529930 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3529931 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3529932 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3529933 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3529934 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3529935 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3529936 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3529937 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3529938 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3529939 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3529940 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3529941 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3529947 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3529948 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3529949 the people hired in an improper way did not themselves do anything wrong it therefore would be unfair and quite possibly illegal given their civil service protections to fire or reassign them without individual cause
3529950 it would have ill served the public interest not to appoint him merely because those who first hired him had violated the civil service laws
3529951 i drive a 10 to 12 hour shift and usually spend 45 to 50 on gas
3529952 sometimes its slow when the conventions are not here and the gas prices its really difficult for taxi drivers
3529953 its certainly a response to higher prices whether its taking fewer trips to the market or purchasing a car instead of an suv
3529954 as prices retreated from 4 a gallon youre staring to see demand increase again
3529955 consumers are going back to their old behaviors lets face it we live in a car culture

3529962 history has shown time and time again that if you leave aggression to go unchecked you only store up graver problems for the future
3529963 for moscow the message from the bucharest compromise was that pressure works
3529964 it was a long time ago and i was never near this standard
3529965 we had a canoe at the side of our house for all his life
3529966 and when he was 14 he was down at the beach one day with his uncle and he said oh can we have a go on these so he and his brother went out in them came back and said we really like canoeing hed never thought to ask why we had a canoe at the side of the house for 14 years
3529967 when he decides to do something he works hard at it
3529968 he feels the need to do something mental to balance out all his training
3529969 on the astronaut application form there was a box saying
3529970 you only get one chance at that final run even though you practice loads and loads it can all go wrong so quickly so yes im delighted with what ive done to come back from fourth with all that pressure on me its just a shame im not one place higher
3529971 this independent report does not reflect conservative party policy and we do not agree with its conclusions we wholeheartedly support the regeneration of northern cities
3529972 many of britains towns and cities have failed and been failed by policy makers for too long
3529973 coastal cities whether large like liverpool and hull or small like scunthorpe and blackpool are most vulnerable they are almost always at the end of the line they have lost their raison detre as ports and it is hard to imagine them prospering at their current sizes
3529974 sunderland demonstrates just how hard it is to regenerate such a city it is time to stop pretending there is a bright future for sunderland and ask ourselves instead what we need to do to offer people in sunderland better prospects
3529975 cities based on highly skilled workers are the most dynamic oxford and cambridge are unambiguously britains leading research universities outside london
3529976 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position
3529977 this report from david camerons favourite thinktank has just dismissed a huge area of the country as worthless is it any wonder there are no tory councillors in liverpool when for all their warm words they have not changed a bit
3529978 its not bad for a country that has no swimming pools and very little soap

3529980 old rivals like australia are saying they are in danger of falling behind team gb in the medal table
3529981 british sportsmen and women in the past have been known to choke under the pressure when up against the aussies
3529982 it is clear that many students are sleepwalking into financial crisis as the credit crunch kicks in and with food and fuel costs set to rise even further we can expect more and more students to get into serious financial difficulty with many having to resort to taking out commercial loans or being bailed out by their parents
3529983 it is extremely worrying that so many students expect to receive financial support yet do not go on to claim it at the moment each university is left to administer its own bursary system and students tell us that the application process is often very confusing
3529984 instead of the system being different in every university we need a single national student support scheme so it is simpler for students to make a claim and so that support is based on what students need not where they study
3529985 lecturers have little desire to teach students who are shattered from working long hours to pay the bills or stressed because of their financial situation
3529986 it is students from poorer backgrounds that find themselves hit the hardest as they are less likely to be able to rely on financial support from their parents
3529987 although getting on the housing ladder or starting a pension will be distant dreams for the majority of generation debt the government must reject calls for higher fees and greater student debt in next years fees review
3529988 fear of debt is a real issue that concerns universities government universities schools and colleges all those involved must continue to ensure that all those who can benefit from going to university are not deterred from doing so by the prospect of debt
3529989 attitudes towards undertaking manageable debt are changing and the vast majority of students see attending university as a worthwhile investment in their future
3529990 what these surveys sometimes fail to acknowledge is the reality that if you succeed at university your employment prospects will be enhanced and you are likely to earn more over your working lifetime
3529991 graduates in the uk continue to enjoy one of the highest financial returns of any oecd country

3529994 im holding it in my hand and it feels like im holding the magna carta its a history changing document
3529995 it is vital the cica understands that women are not responsible for mens criminality because they have a drink or for any other reason
3529996 nobody would suggest that if someones wallet was stolen after having a drink then their compensation should be reduced
3529997 as far as we in the government are concerned a victim of rape is not in any way at all culpable due to alcohol consumption
3529998 as i understand it the cica have accepted that the guidelines were being misapplied i hope that the compensation authority will look at these other cases that they believe may also have had the guidelines misinterpreted and review them without the victims themselves having to go back and ask for that review
3529999 if an applicant accepts our decision then that case is finalised and closed
