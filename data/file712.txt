7120000 its better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all
7120001 e stato un incubo ci hanno picchiato con delle mazze mi hanno legato e costretto a guardare mentre violentavano mia moglie
7120002 reading sarcasm is not that hard it just requires reading comprehension skills
7120003 i would so suck my own balls for a box of pocky
7120004 i felt our second half performance was a good one we created plenty of openings and should have scored two or three more
7120005 first half i felt we were a little too deep but there was a big difference in the second half
7120006 i would be worried if we were playing and werent creating but we are and hopefully that will continue
7120007 we limited inverness to chances only in the second half they were dangerous due to their power and height but overall i was pleased with the way we played
7120008 i had heard about our record of never having scored in inverness but im not interested in it we scored a great goal and should have had more no doubt about that
7120009 at the moment hes scoring and he gets those chances because of his willingness to get himself into good positions
7120010 i thought we were very poor in the second half but youve got to give hibs credit because they are a good side who looked dangerous on the break
7120011 first half i felt we were positive and up for it and while hibs created a few chances i was quite happy with the way we played
7120012 the 30 seconds into the second half and we lose a goal and it just went from there really we simply didnt cause hibs enough problems
7120013 overall im happy id have liked a second goal i thought our play deserved a second goal because at 1 0 their real threat came from corners and free kicks but the goalkeeper was excellent at handling crosses and the defenders were very brave and to keep a clean sheet youre always in with a chance of winning
7120014 if wed scored a second goal early enough we could have gone on to score one or two more there can be no doubt that we did enough to win the game
7120015 he was outstanding today hes designed for getting the ball down and making it happen
7120016 getting into a battle would suit hamilton so we were the team that got the ball down and passed and we wanted to get the ball to taouil so that he could get the ball early and cause the hamilton defence problems
7120017 he causes problems because he is so clever and strong with the ball at his feet and if we got the movement right which we did today we were always a threat against them but to be fair they stuck to their task and didnt make it easy but we were little bit better than them today
7120018 one of our problems last year was we lacked a bit of edge dig and steel in the middle of the park and we have that now he has great composure on the ball and when there is a ball to be won he invariably wins it great asset is he is very good in the air and of course is a help at set plays for and against
7120019 i think the game with clear cut chances in the second half especially the penalty and hitting the crossbar and even another chance right at the very end
7120020 we thought we had another penalty on the back of what we thought was a penalty claim and marc fitzpatrick should probably have scored but there you are its only the third game of the season
7120021 im totally satisfied with the performance and we just need to turn that performance into victories
7120022 but i feel we did enough to merit a win in the second half
7120023 yeah disappointed but pleased with the performance and pleased with a lot of individual performances and pleased with john sutton
7120024 he john sutton also made contributions in other ways he worked hard hes not nearly as fit as were going to get him and therefore hes got a bit more to come
7120025 i thought that we deserved at least a draw at half time
7120026 prince bauben has had a great chance and the goalie has made a great save and then morgaro gomis hits the post from point blank range almost and then we score a good goal so i thought at half time i thought we deserved to be at least level maybe if we had been a little bit luckier we might have been in front
7120027 but there was no indication of what was going to happen in the second half
7120028 we just didnt come out of the traps in the second half at all and right from the kick off we gave the ball away and that allowed motherwell to attack us and get on the ascendancy
7120029 and i didnt think we performed that great in the second half
7120030 probably for the first time since i have been at the club i can honestly say after the game i dont think we deserved to get a point today but we did and thats quite pleasing for me
7120031 hes made one save in particular well the penalty i thought was top drawer i think it was a decent penalty it was hit hard and hes anticipated it and got a good hand to it
7120032 obviously looking at it that has probably kept us in the game with the we way were playing but then if i look at graeme smith and the save he made from prince in the first half was top drawer and then the one at the end was even better because it was going in the top corner and we could have sneaked it
7120033 we could have nicked the three points right at the end but in football you dont always get what you deserve
7120034 it might have been a bit cruel for motherwell but i wouldve been delighted
7120035 with the performance i am happy i am unhappy with the finishing and if we only scored 50 or 60 percent of the chances we created we could have one 6 1 or 7 1
7120036 at the moment i dont like anything more only a win that is most important this team lost a lot of points last year and we must collect the points i think we play good football but we must work on the finishing
7120037 the team understand what i want we play football we dont kick and run we mover without the ball and we create the shots now we must learn to score and this is the only point i am worried about with the team
7120038 david obua is a very good football player but he wanted to show to everyone that he is okay and good and he had a very good chance with his head and he didnt do it but i think for the future this was not a bad choice to take david to hearts
7120039 kello was not so confident because goalkeeper is a special position and behind you is nobody and the harmony wasnt the best between marius zaliukis and berra and kello
7120040 but this is not possible because kello was here but zaliukas and berra were with their national teams also maybe if we find between the defence and the goalkeeper well have a very good goalkeeper
7120041 jamie mcdonald did not lose his place he was not in training he was with the under 21s and it is like a pre season for kello i need to give him a chance to play maybe against airdrie ill put ballogh in the goal right now we need to do everything to give the player a chance and this is the way
7120042 hes lost the weight you see when i came here and christian nade was 110kg about 17 stone and when i first saw nade he was making runs but he didnt run he walked

7120094 la norma que rige actualmente no se cumple por ejemplo yo he defendido y defender siempre el financiamiento estatal de los partidos pol ticos a fin de fortalecerlos pero esto no se est dando y los congresistas en lugar de hacer cumplir la ley se ponen a hacer reclamos in tiles
7120095 no lo entendemos como una sanci n sino como consecuencia elemental de lo que origin esa representaci n el ciudadano opt por esa persona dentro de ese partido si esa relaci n se rompe la relaci n queda vac a de contenido
7120096 si no se puede hacer una reforma efectiva por lo menos deber a exigirse a los organismos competentes que sean rigurosos en la aplicaci n de la ley en otros pa ses las normas son flexibles pero de aplicaci n r gida mientras que en el per son r gidas pero de aplicaci n laxa

7120114 why do i really want this goal to become reality
7120115 collections attorneys are an amazing group of professionals who take their job seriously
7120116 its not a matter of who can harass the consumer most its a matter of you owe money to our client that you should pay back
7120117 i was assuming id go to court go before a judge with all this documentation
7120118 many people tell us they didnt understand when they received the summons and complaint they didnt realize they were being sued
7120119 debt collectors have an uncanny ability to come up with the right address once it comes time to get the money but they have a hard time coming up with the right address when it comes time to serve the summons and complaint
7120120 its not as if all of a sudden out of the blue collectors say hey mr
7120121 i dont know what else we can do other than to make the default judgment papers pink
7120122 that back end piece where the burden is shifting back to the consumer to prove the money is exempt is unfair to the consumer
7120123 collectors need to adhere to the consumer protection laws that are already on the books in minnesota to ensure that they do not freeze or garnish exempt funds
7120124 it makes no sense to me that you can use the power of the state of minnesota to sue somebody without paying a fee to us and bringing it into court
7120125 our civil judges in hennepin county carry way over the national caseload
7120126 once youre in danger of losing money i think the court should be on top of it i think they need to stop rubber stamping
7120127 people have the right to expect that in the police department and fire department people will be evaluated in their job that those evaluations will matter and that the best people will be promoted to positions of supervision
7120128 the departments are still not where we need to be in terms of diversity
7120129 what the consent decree did was keep the prize in front of us so we knew that we still had some work to do
7120130 weve spent thousands and thousands of dollars in defense of our officers trying to get a fair resolution in the promotional practices
7120131 a story in the paper about how dexters were great cows that were no bigger than a large dog and could be kept around the house

7120134 im a vegetarian and want a pig for a pet i couldnt eat one
7120135 surely its possible to make them smaller ive seen them small and one would be great in my flat
7120136 no i cant make a pig smaller i dont have an incredible shrinking ray and im not selling you a pig to keep in your flat goodbye
7120137 weve taken the same quality of money management and the same compensation system that the rich have always had access to and weve brought it to regular people hardworking americans
7120138 at the time i was really upset about it but in hindsight its the best thing that ever happened
7120139 in life there are some things where brand name means something in the world of mutual funds there are lots of undiscovered gems

7120142 i liked that i didnt have to meet a quota to sell a certain type of product
7120143 based on how they did in the past and on the manager
7120144 if you have a fund that returns 3 percent if you lose 1 5 percent from the mutual funds administrative fee and 1 5 percent from the adviser you effectively get no return from that fund
7120145 the increase is largely due to the shift by advisers toward more highly customized solutions
7120146 the idea that they can help you pick outperforming funds consistently long term for their 150 basis points 1 5 percent i think is totally bogus and is misleading the public
7120147 this is one of the most exciting recording projects for me and i am looking forward to getting it out as soon as possible for everyone to enjoy
7120148 as ive said over the years i still want the tony oscar and emmy

7120151 but that was the age difference and not that she was mean or anything
7120152 generally shunned the tent revival circuit preferring a straight backed form of methodism that valued reason over passion and temperance over both
7120153 im on the edge of something and it would be so much easier to explain if i had overcome heroin addiction or had some other radical change in my life
7120154 my growth as an artist and a person has been so slow and gradual its hard to make a story out of it
7120155 im not trying to settle any scores my intention wasnt to hurt or expose anyone but just tell the truth about my life
7120156 everything but the writing and thats why i kept doing it its the only time i ever felt sane like a whole person who was useful who had any power who was in control when i was at bu right after high school i had these horrible panicky nights where i thought if i didnt find a band i was going to kill myself the two choices were find a band or die thats how it felt
7120157 she wore the same thing every day a leather biker jacket jeans and a white t shirt and clunky shoes with her hair in a ponytail
7120158 juliana didnt look like anyone else at berklee there was an aura about her and i was drawn to her air of mystery we were 18 but we didnt wait until we were ready we just jumped in
7120159 while juliana seems very fragile in many ways shes really not
7120160 shes a tough broad attitudinal in a big way and i dont think she was really willing to do things that one needs to do those things are stay on point mostly she made some unfortunate decisions which she would say were circumstances for instance to cancel a tour right when she needed to be doing it maybe i was a bad manager in that i didnt make her do it on my business card for years it just said enabler i wanted to be an artists advocate but i now kind of wish id gotten things done
7120161 i dont blame her for feeling at the end of her rope
7120162 shes been playing to the same audience year after year and when sales are going down rather than up youre wondering why youre even doing it whos going to buy this does anybody really care i told her if you make a record thats a leap you may have a chance to reinvigorate your career or lets go out with a bang my agenda was to do something much more refined something groovy and evocative and bring out what i thought was a beautiful textured voice which had been buried in a rock guitar pastiche or because juliana wouldnt sing out
7120163 the rejection doesnt make me second guess myself anymore i know its a good album and i got really good feedback and i realize that the music industry is sort of falling apart so i was able to not take it so personally
7120164 i say ive made peace but its like i dont want to admit that theres still a part of me that still doesnt understand why i dont get much notice
7120165 i dont want to seem like im complaining up until now i thought im cool with everything im an artist man i dont care if people buy my records but i wonder why i dont get much recognition
7120166 its just taking a while maybe ill be peaking in september maybe in 10 years thats why i havent quit because i dont feel like im there yet but im closer than i ever was
7120167 entrei aqui na internet e me deparei com fotos da mulher fil na praia a mulher fil somente uma das carnes do meu rod zio adoro onde isso vai chegar apesar de ter minhas cr ticas esse fen meno mulheres frutas e etc o que vejo de fato o que eu j sei muito tempo mas agora com as mulheres todas aparecendo pra m dia posando nuas dan ando confirmo que a mulher brasileira boa gostosa tem carne tem bund o tem cox o e muitos a es fui criticada sacaneada e por que n o dizer humilhada muitas vezes com piadinhas sobre minha forma f sica por ser justamente esse tipo de mulher agora vejo mulheres com o corpo igual ou parecido ao meu sendo admiradas pelos homens e principalmente tachadas de gostosas pela m dia o que ser que aconteceu quem mudou

7120208 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
7120209 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
7120210 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
7120211 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
7120212 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
7120213 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
7120214 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
7120215 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
7120216 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
7120217 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
7120218 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
7120219 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
7120220 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
7120221 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
7120222 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
7120223 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

7120229 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security

7120234 consumers need to be able to communicate in a safe environment with debt collectors
7120235 debt collectors are required by federal law and have been since 1977 to treat you the same way the wal mart greeter treats you with truth fairness dignity and respect
7120236 this is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose
7120237 very very real need for debt collectors to take the publics perception of the industry very seriously

7120425 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7120426 in all my years in the senate i have never ever seen washington so broken

7120453 ive said before we suffered on the counter attack when other teams play a 9 1 formation if you score a goal it changes completely
7120454 i noted a lot of things against czech republic the good things and the bad things it is important for me because the four games we played before the level of teams were not like this
7120455 against czech republic i understood where we have to improve
7120456 at this moment there is a difference physically from the czechs and england players they were faster with more pressing and we suffered from this
7120457 they need to find a good condition it is impossible at the moment to be 100 per cent before the game i decided wayne rooney and lampard would only play one hour i saw on tv rooney and gerrard but i did not see them myself last weekend
7120458 i was told both were so so and not in perfect condition for me these players are an important part of the team and i want to see them on the pitch
7120459 i think against czech republic i saw a good spirit not like croatia i think they are like turkey and have a big spirit of the country
7120460 but i am happy because the reaction of the players during the czech game was positive

7120480 a clear double standard in the mainstream media will likely ensure senator biden gets a pass over these comments that would get a republican in deep trouble if he ever made a similar statement
7120481 surprised to hear that i am a cardiothoracic surgeon leading a national association of indian americans who are physicians attorneys and small business owners its amazing to know we dont all work at dunkin donuts or the local 7 11

7120544 its a problem here how to get into touch with the shiahs not the tribal people in the country were on intimate terms with all of them but the grimly devout citizens of the holy towns and more especially the leaders of religious opinion the mujtahids who can loose and bind with a word by authority which rests on an intimate acquaintance with accumulated knowledge entirely irrelevant to human affairs and worthless in any branch of human activity there they sit in an atmosphere which reeks of antiquity and is so thick with the dust of ages that you cant see through it nor can they and for the most part they are very hostile to us a feeling we cant alter theres a group of these worthies in kadhimain the holy city 8 miles from baghdad bitterly pan islamic anti british chief among them are a family called sadr possibly more distinguished for religious learning than any other family in the whole shiah world i went yesterday to visit them accompanied by an advanced shiah of baghdad whom i knew well

7120596 mi piacerebbe che fosse messa in risalto la bellezza sia fisica che spirituale delle suore ha detto alladnkronos padre rungi stiamo parlando di persone molto preparate che operano nel sociale dove oltre alla bellezza spirituale ma per avere visibilit c anche bisogno di una bella presenza
7120597 lidea mi venuta parlando con alcune sorelle con le quali stavo pregando sulla spiaggia di mondragone ha spiegato il prete casertano eravamo in preghiera con turisti e villeggianti a dimostrazione di quanto sia aperta la mentalit di queste suore
7120598 si tratta di uniniziativa che sfrutta le potenzialit del web ha sottolineato padre rungi infatti verr gestita interamente su internet
7120599 gli stessi utenti del web il contatto non sar diretto ma online
7120600 e importante ha aggiunto don rungi sfruttare tutte le potenzialit del web infatti lassociazionismo cattolico molto attivo in questo campo daltronde ormai il modo migliore per poter mediare con i giovani
7120601 vorrei che si sfatasse il mito della suora vecchia trascurata e cattiva ha spiegato padre rungi ce ne sono tante soprattutto quelle che fanno formazione con i giovani che sono estremamente attive e preparate devono essere soprattutto al passo coi tempi visto che hanno a che fare con ragazzi
7120602 ho ricevuto anche qualche mail di dissenso ha ammesso padre rungi di cristiani che non hanno colto lo spirito di evangelizzazione insito in questa idea purtroppo alcune persone hanno una mentalit ancora chiusa e pensano che si debbano utilizzare solo i media tradizionali

7120606 it wasnt the best round so i need to play a little bit better tomorrow and the rest of the playoffs
7120607 the way the points system is set up over these four weeks every round and every shot and every position matters because of the variance in points
7120608 so it may not look it this week but if i can fight out and play a good round tomorrow and move up and finish in the top 10 or 20 down the road if i happen to win it will give me more of a cushion or if i happen to play better the next couple of weeks it will better position me
7120609 i dont have a great answer for that because i feel like ive been driving the ball pretty good

7120651 the news coverage has been far from fair and balanced especially during the first days of the crisis
7120652 it is still not quite clear whether the west was aware of mr saakashvilis plans to invade south ossetia and this is a serious matter
7120653 what is clear is that western assistance in training georgian troops and shipping large supplies of arms had been pushing the region toward war rather than peace

7120658 we had a very good meeting with secretary rice we discussed a number of regional iraqi internal issues and also we discussed the strategic framework agreement that there has been a great deal of progress in fact secretary rice meeting this morning with prime minister was positive and we are very close to finalize this important agreement

7120676 these findings provide further evidence that the health system is falling short of where it needs to be to ensure health and economic security we need a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance available
7120677 whats happened number one young people liberals a solid core of obamas base just raising some questions about him for liberals maybe the perception that hes flip flopped on some key issues like fisa and a sense that for young people i think especially that maybe hes not the unique different sort of political persona that they expected
7120678 it was one of washingtons biggest scandals and the republican power broker ralph reed was in the middle of it in deep with convicted felon and lobbyist jack abramoff but when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify that senator john mccain and who is now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed for twenty six years in washington john mccain has played the same old games we just cant afford more of the same
7120679 if we dont reenact the draft i dont think well have anyone to chase bin laden to the gates of hell

7120681 one this is the best military weve ever had and its just not big enough two there has never been a draft that i have ever heard of since world war ii that was fair what weve done is we find rich people find a way out and lower income people are the ones that serve so the thing if you could design i might consider it i dont think its necessary i might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve
7120682 i have become very concerned with the possibility that this administration may have violated federal law by using the resources of our intelligence agencies to influence domestic policy processes or opinion
7120683 we are aware of the media reports and therefore we have to look into it
7120684 im duty bound to follow the law and apply to the law to the facts as i find them and it is on behalf of those millions of americans who believe in and value our democratic process and the right to vote that i put forth this objection today if they are willing to stand at polls for countless hours in the rain as many did in ohio then i should surely stand up for them here in the halls of congress this objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning the victory of the president but it is a necessary timely and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy i raise this objection neither to put the nation in the turmoil of a proposed overturned election nor to provide cannon fodder or partisan demagoguery for my fellow members of congress i raise this objection because i am convinced that we as a body must conduct a formal and legitimate debate about election irregularities i raise this objection to debate the process and protect the integrity of the true will of the people

7120716 we have to give our troops a way to end their mission honorably that means leaving behind a success not a failure what is success i dont think it is iraq as a jeffersonian democracy i think it is an iraq that is relatively stable largely self sufficient comparatively open and free and in control of its own destiny
7120717 theres no magic bullet for the situation in iraq its very very difficult
7120718 im ashamed of a man or a woman that would sell stories true or not true to tabloids in the time of a crisis
7120719 it always hurts when someone says something that isnt true

7120721 the globe and tony frost in particular have more reason to go for the ramseys than the police have
7120722 bush had begun his second term talking boldly of ending tyranny in the world but the bloodshed in iraq has narrowed his focus and turned much of the country against him
7120723 in those days after 9 11 i thought the president did a terrific job and i really was moved as well as impressed by the speech that he gave to the congress
7120724 there has been a pattern of broken promises and basic deceptions that diminish the presidency degrade our strength and disrespect the american people
7120725 democrats are about helping the american people to get ahead

7120736 has lost my vote my familys vote and i believe a large percent of hillary supporters
7120737 could have been an easy win for the democratic ticket i thought obama was smarter than that i guess i was wrong
7120738 no wonder obama revealed his choice in the dead of the night and buried this over the weekend
7120739 all hillary supporters will lick their wounds and support the obama biden ticket bidens experience will be invaluable as they decide what will work and what will not
7120740 brings instant credibility on foreign policy and the current inner workings of washington
7120741 sure obamas all about change but you dont get to real change without first understanding how the current system works and how to influence that process in a new direction
7120742 will allay the fears of floating voters who are leaning toward voting obama in november but have concerns over his limited foreign policy experience
7120743 will send shock down the spine of the mccain team which is making foreign policy the centerpiece of its campaign also bidens selection enhances obamas chances of winning in pa and doing well with blue collar voters
7120744 the speaker we heard on that sunny day in newark was the same joe biden that barack obama was thinking of when he made his vice presidential choice this week smart focused clear concise humorous and warmly engaging
7120745 in the face of the flood of cynicism and skepticism that characterizes so many of our views of washington politicians these days biden is one of the very few washington insiders who manages to maintain his constituents faith and hope and trust
7120746 i was waiting to see who obama was going to pick because i thought that would tell a lot about the direction he wanted to take his presidency
7120747 if hes willing to listen to biden hes heading in the right direction i think it really shows strength in his character that hes able to accept a man who really criticized him and to listen to him that says a lot about him
7120748 all of a sudden its not just about history and change and how far weve come since 1968 its about can we really move forward and yeah with that kind of ambition from obama and that kind of perseverance from biden we can do that
7120749 while i have nothing against joe biden i am disgusted and for the first time ever i have no clue who to vote for i know obamas big message is change so he picks a running mate that has been in dc longer than i have been old enough to vote he picked biden because of his experience which sounds logical but how is he going to change with a certified member of old washington on the ticket
7120750 bidens irish catholic working class roots are ones that i can relate to as an hispanic voter i remember sen biden during the gulf war and have always thought he was a straight shooter and very credible statesman sen biden provides the wisdom factor he is truly a senior statesman and his foreign policy experience is very reassuring during these times sen biden more than makes up for all the shortcomings that obama has in my opinion im elated that he has been chosen for vp position this kind of leadership is exactly what the democratic party and our country needs
7120751 obamas choice was a very smart one i have always appreciated joe bidens directness and i feel he gives nice balance to the ticket obama is smart enough to admit that he doesnt know everything and does have weaknesses and he selected someone who has great knowledge in those areas the presidential ticket is now very well rounded and i believe the election has just been won by the democrats also smart move on the announcement the plan was to build anticipation and they certainly succeeded every news channel was standing by for the announcement had me turning on the news as soon as i woke up to hear it kudos
7120752 the greatest charge against john mccain has been that he has been in washington too long to make a difference in the white house with the addition of sen joe biden the obama campaign can no longer make this charge perhaps the greatest problem with his vice presidential selection is that we all know joe biden and weve written him off after several failed attempts at the presidency all that obama has managed to do with this pick is alert the world that john mccain is right he does have a glaring weakness in foreign policy
7120753 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased

7120759 until today hospital death rates were closely guarded secrets discussed in board rooms but beyond the reach of patients whose lives are on the line that changed this morning when usa today posted on its website the governments best estimates of heart attack heart failure and pneumonia death rates for every u s hospital for two years
7120760 when last summers cms report came out one of the 11 hospitals in the dallas based system baylor all saints medical center in fort worth was found to have a heart failure death rate of 14 6 higher than the 11 1 average
7120761 im delighted senator obama has chosen joe biden as his running mate his extensive experience dealing with foreign policy issues are an asset in these complicated times he will be a great partner for barack obama in bringing about the change so desperately needed in our country and restoring to america our sense of optimism and hope for a brighter future i am proud to support this incredible team
7120762 five years almost i was expected to win every tournament i entered so maybe now it changes a little bit
7120763 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces

7120774 the only silver linings i can see are the level of international political support expressed to georgia as a result of this crisis as well as the strange fact that it seems to have shocked armenia and azerbaijan into more serious dialogue to resolve their long standing problems
7120775 the last thing georgia needs at this moment are guys with guns wandering around the countryside outside of the direct control of the central government
7120776 he may have committed an illegal action but morally he was right and it meant a lot for him to say that to the army
7120777 he felt good that he got to speak his mind about why he did what he did he knows that he did the legally wrong thing but the morally right thing
7120778 hes a young man who is a very good man

7120817 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace

7120830 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7120831 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7120832 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7120833 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7120834 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7120835 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7120836 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7120837 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7120838 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7120839 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7120840 senator hillary clinton will be the headline prime time speaker and former virginia governor mark warner will deliver the keynote address on tuesday night
7120841 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7120842 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7120843 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7120844 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7120845 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7120846 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7120847 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7120848 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7120849 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7120850 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7120851 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7120852 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7120853 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7120854 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7120855 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7120856 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7120857 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7120858 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7120859 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7120860 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7120861 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7120862 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7120863 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7120864 way way down inside honey you need it im gonna give you my love
7120865 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7120866 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7120867 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7120868 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7120869 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7120870 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7120871 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7120872 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7120873 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7120874 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7120875 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7120876 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7120877 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7120878 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7120879 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7120880 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7120881 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7120882 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7120883 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7120884 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7120885 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7120886 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7120887 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7120888 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7120889 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7120890 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7120891 i try to buy businesses that are so good an idiot could run them because someday one will
7120892 human beings cannot survive unless they create a provision for the future
7120893 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7120894 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7120895 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7120896 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7120897 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7120898 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7120899 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7120900 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7120901 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7120902 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7120903 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7120904 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7120905 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7120906 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7120907 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7120908 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7120909 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7120910 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7120911 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7120912 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7120913 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7120914 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7120915 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7120916 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7120917 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7120918 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7120919 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7120920 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7120921 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7120922 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7120923 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7120924 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7120925 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7120926 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7120927 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7120928 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7120929 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7120930 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7120931 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7120932 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7120933 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7120934 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7120935 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7120936 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7120937 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7120938 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7120939 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7120940 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7120941 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7120942 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7120943 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7120944 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
7120945 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
7120946 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
7120947 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7120948 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7120949 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7120950 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7120951 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7120952 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7120953 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7120954 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7120955 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
7120956 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7120957 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7120958 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7120959 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7120960 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7120961 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7120962 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7120963 during july and early august caribou can be seen violently shaking their heads stamping their feet and racing wildly over the tundra for no apparent reason they are seeking to evade warble or bot flies
7120964 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7120965 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7120966 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7120967 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7120968 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7120969 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7120970 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7120971 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7120972 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7120973 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7120974 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7120975 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7120976 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7120977 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7120978 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7120979 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7120980 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7120981 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7120982 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7120983 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7120984 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7120985 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7120986 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7120987 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7120988 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7120989 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7120990 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7120991 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7120992 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7120993 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7120994 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7120995 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7120996 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7120997 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7120998 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7120999 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7121000 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7121001 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7121002 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7121003 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7121004 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7121005 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7121006 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7121007 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7121008 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7121009 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7121010 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7121011 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7121012 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7121013 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7121014 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7121015 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7121016 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7121017 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7121018 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7121019 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7121020 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7121021 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7121022 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7121023 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7121024 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7121025 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7121026 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7121027 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7121028 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7121029 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7121030 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7121031 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7121032 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7121033 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7121034 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7121035 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7121036 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7121037 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7121038 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7121039 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7121040 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7121041 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7121042 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7121043 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7121044 ooooooh strum ooooh what is life but leaves and flowers and candy rocks strrrum why is she leeeaving steeeerum ooooh ooooh rain and sun ooooh sun

7121052 bottled water companies have had a fabulous ride on an unnecessary fad
7121053 im really delighted that london has done this because it really makes us focus on some fundam
7121054 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago

7121172 oh im not from around here whereupon lorraine spoke to the next young man walking by do you speak english and can you direct us to si so ended up with two young men helping us one familiar with the area and the other speaking english we paid attention to the directions four blocks that way and then two blocks to the right philip made the unwise suggestion that we go two blocks to the right and then four blocks the other way and im afraid that i answered him rather curtly im going to get pissed off if we keep getting lost and he quickly agreed to follow the directions we were amazed to see young man 2 catching up with us to correct his directions and to accompany us to make sure we were on the right track we communicated struggling in spanish and learned that he works at the local radisson hotel and has an 11 year old daughter he reassured us that we were very safe walking about with our backpack and passport holder still stuffed into my t shirt finally we were certain that we could find our way back to our starting place on our own and actually started recognizing landmarks when we just happened across the market where wed shopped earlier we decided to find some mayonnaise i for some unknown reason remembered pedro and alba telling her the spanish word for mustard sounds like moustach a so that the young clerk helping us actually understood what we wanted and led us to the right section we also were gently reprimanded by a very young woman all in spanish but very easy to understand that we were supposed to leave our bags and backpack in the lockers at the front of the store this is certainly a learning experience our two errands ended up being a two hour trek but full of interesting sights and helpful people back at the apartment i decided to get online which became a huge challenge then the telephone card refused to work because neither of us could understand the recording in rapid spanish explaining what number to press for english instructions i called maria noel but she couldnt help with this one i ended up calling pedro twice on my cell phone and he immediately called me back on his telephone card twice i called on my cell without the country code and ended up talking to a very irate spanish man somewhere in so america definitely not pedro philip struggled with the tv the satellite may have been roaming or something because he got nothing for quite a while i spoke with noe who had maria noel call me back they try and i am so grateful p is enjoying a couple of mixed drinks and watching a lovely movie that we saw together about women just before ww2 having a lovely holiday in italy he can not understand why i d rather write in this journal than watch the movie but believe me i can hear it just fine 7 p m we did manage to eat a delicious sandwich ham cheese tomato lettuce with an apple and some pretty bland cookies for dessert and then a bit of the bbc the shower was easier to negotiate this 2nd time around apartment description the front main door is locked and the lobby is simple but attractive the elevator is european styled with an accordion door that must be closed before it works there are two apartments per floor and the inside door to this one is heavily double bolted the only door opens directly into the living dining room with the narrow wall on the left mirrored from ceiling to floor to the right is a very comfortable dining room table with four chairs and a wall mounted tv unobtrusively overhead two brown leather couches one regular size and one love seat size are in the living room with a couple of tables an interesting smallish cupboard also lines the wall the kitchen is tiny but perfectly adequate they have nothing in excess counter space is about the same size as our rv but is made of granite with a drop in sink the refrigerator is minimal and the doors open the wrong way the only light is one overhead ceiling light the stove is fascinating three gas burners which require a match and also the gas turned on from under the sink area plus one electrical outlet which requires a breaker directly over the stove to be turned on there is a conventional oven microwave in spanish with one label start appliances are as were used to a table is folded against the wall opposite the sink and appliance wall along with two stools off the kitchen is a small porch with a tiny washing machine which we dread using after an experience years ago in east berlin miscellaneous items and windows that open up to a clothesline two bedrooms and a bath complete the unit one bedroom is used as an office with computer futon set of drawers cd collection good sized closet and a shelving unit the other bedroom has a queen or king bed with one of the most comfortable mattresses ive ever slept on two dressers tv 2 night stands and another closet the bathroom is unique in our experience the shower is almost as small as the one in the rv and has sliding doors the pedestal sink serves the purpose the toilet reminds us of european ones and the bidet is yet to be tested the neatness and efficiency of such a small space is something to be admired plus it is decorated with a slightly whimsical air i do hear a dog barking nearly and we saw a few strays in the city today su 8 17 08 1 30 pm day 2 some things from yesterday we saw horses pulling open buggies in the city and thought they were collecting garbage we thought like mackinac island right p if i had a gun i d shoot them all to put them out of their misery they didn t look that miserable to me but i m always the optimistic one plus surely the owners all youngish men would want to keep them relatively healthy the weather turned very warm yesterday but everyone still seemed to be bundled up i could have worn shorts and been comfortable but saw only one young man on a bicycle in shorts everyone especially the women are in winter colors some with boots i keep forgetting it really is winter here we saw many people drinking mate an infusion of mate grass on the traditional porongo made from small natural calabash out of their straws and carrying extra or perhaps just hot water in their thermoses pedro recommended that we slip the customs inspector a 20 american bill p tried to but the agent refused it and we didn t have our luggage yet perhaps it is different for citizens of uruguay slept very well until 7 am p of course was awake earlier and listened to american music but no news we re hearing about a hurricane faye category 1 heading for so florida mostly on the earthlink internet news plus i can always look at the sun sentinel online i forgot to take my fosomax again but did make oatmeal with raisins and brown sugar from our shopping trip p manned the toaster for whole wheat toast that kept falling apart but tasted just fine l i m not washing all these glasses and mugs any more pick one mug and use it for everything please we had no idea of the temp outdoors but left about 9 am p wearing his long sleeved shirt over a t shirt and me wearing my pink hooded sweatshirt we both left our passports home today but carried id just in case it was pretty nippy to our surprise 8 degrees c 46f but it did not seem that cold to me the wind didn t help and p kept saying he didn t need to return to the apt for his coat but he did eventually put his red neckerchief on after figuring out where the buildings trash bin was in front on the side of the street we wanted to walk to the ocean only a few blocks away per the map that we figured we d better use today however when we ventured across the street past a school for life building very old we were uncomfortable in the neighborhood and changed the plan only the port is at this part of the coastline not worth walking nervously for there were not that many people about which was good in some respects and bad in others instead we walked the same way as we did yesterday but not off the main street libertador discovering a tourist info place that we must visit tomorrow when it s open we took a right at av 18 de julio an important street main and long and entered the ciudad vieja the old city at the plaza indepencia there was the radisson hotel 25 stories high and we stopped to try to find gustavo who was so helpful to us yesterday the desk clerk a young woman took one look at us and said hello may i help you it is amazing how people know right away that we are not natives she tried her best to find our man they employ 450 workers there and we left a thank you note for gustavo with her it is a lovely hotel with exceptional ba os after checking out the teatro solis the main theater of uruguay and the oldest with the first performance in 1856 some parts of it are being renovated and tours are offered daily just a few blocks away was the ocean or maybe the plate river they seem to meet somewhere around there not the familiar blue green clear waters that we re used to in florida but dark and cold looking with many whitecaps brrr a number of high rise apartments lined the coastal street and we walked on a side street to return to the av 18 de julio where we stopped in at a ta ta store making sure to put alba s shopping bag into a locker this time and browsed around the compact department store that sells food too many clerks were on guard watching for shoplifters we could not figure out the spanish word for peanut butter and it is not in the dictionary that pedro left for us so i have emailed pedro for assistance saw a jar that looked like it but with words leche and vachon milk and cow which made me think no p stopped at one newsstand and asked for a usa today with no luck when he asked a valet at the radisson about one the man actually laughed and said in effect not here maybe in buenos aires on our walk back p started to walk in front of a taxi cab and i called to him stop p i thought he d stop for me l and then offer you a usa today doesn t take much to amuse us most days the streets and sidewalks are full of litter apparently there is no law about cleaning up after your dog either many of the buildings are downright decrepit but once in a while we see one that is painted and cleaned up to look beautiful we ve seen some very old vehicles including a morris minor and a chevrolet truck that reminded me of my father s from the farm days elderly people seem to be downtrodden and walk around with very sober almost sad expressions we passed one street person sleeping in a makeshift bed next to a building and then enjoyed a little boy learning to ride his new bike with training wheels on the sidewalk everyone was dressed very warmly today including scarves and gloves our most interesting encounter so far was with a young aren t they always young woman who took one look at us and made a point of asking in english can i help you when we said that we were today ok she carmen carried on an animated conversation with us asking her 13 year old daughter for help and getting very little c i pay a lot of money to send her to school to learn english to be my dictionary and she s not helping me today carmen is a lawyer lives at 1814 libertador st apt 801 has only one child because it is so expensive to send kids to private schools etc explained how she leaves all her rings and other jewelry at home because they were going to what we think is a flea market p asked about the litter ten years ago the trash and rubbish policy changed they used to pick up once a day and people would actually bring their bags to the sidewalk to be handed over to the collectors then someone came up with the idea of the rubbish bins now the 6 000 men driving the 6 000 horse and buggies either collect or go through the rubbish to get what they can resell this got a little confusing cause trash to be all over the streets this doesn t make any sense but perhaps pedro and alba will explain it to us we finally went our separate ways the next chuckle was seeing a tiny white booth on the side of the sidewalk with a man inside drinking some mate l are we ready for the question of the day p just what is that man doing inside that little booth we never could figure it out back home by noon pretty walked out and hungry i made grilled ham cheese onion and tomato sandwiches with the end of the potato chips which we never eat but which noe and maria noel bought for us and they tasted delicious p watched some documentary on the first mission to the moon we think that the hose hanging over and into the kitchen sink is from the washing machine which we absolutely dread using but we haven t discovered a close by laundromat forgot to mention that the apt walls are painted the bedroom and living floors are covered in a parquet style wood but with five separate pieces of wood in each block the bathroom floor is very cold all the time we opened the windows when we got back today but then it cooled down quickly 7 p m p watched tv while i typed about our adventures we decided to walk the other direction on libertador st per pedro s suggestion and what a great idea it was pharmacy laundromat restaurant bakery and palacio legislativeo the top of which we have been using for one of our landmarks pedro told us to ask for their niece officialle monica rodriguez chief of security but instead we just walked around the perimeter admiring the beautiful building and looking for the restaurant he recommended found it we picked up two rolls at a bakery after a quick food shop stop for eggs cereal and two unknown croquettes for supper pedro also gave me the spanish word for peanut butter manteca de mani man tay ca de man ee but we haven t found it yet home for a bit of r and r followed by the croquettes and an early night we didn t know what the croquettes were stuffed with when we purchased them and we still don t even after eating them funny story about my raincoat as i looked in the closet where p has hung up his clothes master bedroom i noticed a raincoat that i assumed was alba s that was exactly like mine later on i figured out that p had hung it up for me that first morning when we arrived and it was mine day 3 mo 8 18 2 pm we sleep until 7 am no matter where we are or what time zone we re in very interesting p offered to make an omelet and toast for us this morning both delicious he s having a difficult time adjusting to the different electric stove we haven t yet tried the gas burners to determine what to wear we look outside at the passers by and see what they are all wearing this morning there were a lot of scarves pulled over faces so we bundled up too with gloves and heavy coats i called the american embassy to let them know that we are here but i have to call back between 11 am and 12 15 pm and speak to the american citizen office something like that we bagged up our dirty clothes and headed for the laundromat a few buildings away only to find it closed up tight with a sign on it referring to another day of the week and 1800 hours whatever p chose to carry it hoping to find another close by one but it was still with us when we entered the tourist information center our clerk spoke very little english so i asked him only the most important questions was my wristwatch time correct yes how could we go on a tour of the city in english he suggested the transhotel but we ended back at the radisson where we discovered that the daily tri lingual tour starts at 2 30 is 3 4 hrs long and costs 20 am each i tried to explain the problem with the telephone card he suggested that we ask an antel shop an official telephone place where to buy postcards and stamps at the correo post office across the street but i wanted picture postcards library he marked it on the map he gave us post office the correro bus schedules get a guia eureka bus schedule from the library laundromat closest was 1194 mercedes we didn t try to find out about a rec center for ping pong or pool or thrift shops or book stores off we went still with the dirty clothes to the ipso wash where grisel whose daughter was born in nj and therefore is an american citizen helped us with a smattering of english and lot of heart she not we did the laundry for us and we returned in 1 hrs to pick it up clean and folded what a treat it cost us about 7 we then walked to the radisson for info about the bus tour we must make reservations along the way we stopped first at the agency that sells tickets for the seacat that transports people to buenos aires it involves a bus ride to colonia and then the boat we would have to catch the bus at 6 30 am salida or departure from colonia at 9 45 am and llegada which i can not find in the sp to english dictionary at 10 45 am so it s four hours one way to get there we would return at 11 15 pm this is a very long day on our trek we saw an ad for 3 days and 2 nights in buenos aires which i mis pronounced and was corrected in a rather patronizing and smirky manner bway nos i reese not bway nos aye reese so talked to sandra garcia who spoke english she gave us a print out with a list of hotels and prices based on them looks like 111 each for double occupancy plus we would add 44 if we did not want to take the very slow overnight boat sounds like a possible the radisson was its usual elegant self with excellent ba os we actually found picture postcards nearby i asked at the ta ta shop for peanut butter in spanish of course they don t carry it it was time to pick up the laundry and grisel tried to help us with the telephone card p gave her a susan b anthony dollar coin as a little thank you souvenir we trudged back stopping to pick up a couple of sandwiches one with jamon pork and one with carne meat getting back about 12 45 i ate an entire can of tuna with celery and lettuce plus crackers for lunch p had 1 sandwiches eduardo rang the doorbell to check on us he speaks absolutely no english and couldn t understand that we had the porch window open for some fresh air apparently this weather is very cold to them right now p is watching some kind of movie that is very loud he is not that happy with the selection of tv and he is not that enthralled with montevideo but we are here and will make the best of it impressions of the city graffiti is everywhere i have never before seen a man pulling a wheeled cart so heavy that he was bent over we also saw a man pulling a rickshaw arrangement there are many street people today must be a school day for we noticed many children out and about at lunch time some with uniforms and all with back packs on the plus side flowers are blooming pansies are holding their own and the palm trees in various plazas help beautify the areas we actually visited a tree that looked very old in amongst a few buildings it looked as though they d built the structures around the tree to keep it how unique the sidewalks are all broken up i will think twice before complaining about hollywood s sidewalks again p is having some kidney aches he blamed it on too much whiskey in two days when i suggested that we not buy any whiskey for a while he agreed and said we ll get some gin or vodka not as lethal that wasn t exactly what i meant 5 15 pm p watched some mission impossible movie while i typed and computed away i signed up for a few free spanish language lessons online and p joined me as we learned how to say i want to whatever we went out mid afternoon to walk to the palacio leg and asked a security guard to radio officialle monica rodriguez she showed up a petite slim trim young woman and a lt cmdr per her stripes head of security per pedro and alba she said something in spanish of course about looking for us yesterday but glad to see us today we trotted off behind her as she assigned someone to accompany us as we joined a group of school children on a tour the docent asked if we understood spanish pocito little ask me to repeat anything you don t understand since we didn t understand 99 9 we made a graceful exit but did enjoy the beauty of the main hall of the building it was very windy and cold our last interaction occurred at the local farmicia when we tried to communicate our desires body lotion mouthwash and powder for a man with slow speaking and lots of body gestures we ended up getting two out of three not bad but the price 22 for lotion and mouthwash not exactly wal mart prices i ll make us some stir fry tonight p is listening to a classical cd of pedro s my back and neck are a little uncomfortable because pedro s monitor is to the right and i m not used to being so twisted up also the kitchen counter and sink are lower than what i m used to so i feel as though i m crouching in there not a good feeling we need to eat out more 7 p m stir fry was good with mostly the veggies that noe and maria noel bought and left in the refrigerator for us food thoughts the cookies and crackers are very very bland but perhaps we are just used to the sweetened and salted ones in the u s i remember years ago when the couple from germany stayed in my apt in hollywood before i moved to my condo they felt terrible because they broke a little juice glass and i tried to reassure them that it was very old but not antique and that i had enough others it is very difficult being in someone else s home for an extended time like this but we are doing our best to keep things the way they were and not to break anything really major or minor day 4 tu 8 19 9 am forgot to mention the guards in the palacio leg yesterday they were dressed in green and white uniforms a style from a century or so ago and they stood like the guards at buckingham palace so stiff and on duty slept the best so far last night no liquor and woke about 7 20 p i didn t dare wake you up good go out of the room make the coffee watch tv quietly but just don t wake me up not asking too much i do believe cold cereal fruit and toast for breakfast and p is shaving and then doing the washing up ive put on the long sleeved soft cotton t shirt from alex cook and l l bean feels so good 2 pm we departed a little later than usual and it was a bit colder than the previous days as well our first destination was the radisson to reserve our spots for tomorrow afternoons tours i suggested that i pay from my stash of american money but p insisted on putting it on his credit card when we finished with the arrangements we learned that they don t take credit cards so p had to pay the almost 800 pesos in uruguayan money which meant another trip to the atm later on our next stop was at what we thought was the library per the info man yesterday but instead it was a lovely bookstore where paulo a young man who reminded us of dario helped us enormously i still want a phrase book but they really didn t have what i needed he said that many uruguayans are writers and that there is one reader for every writer his own theory that he chuckled at it was a good place to donate the paperback book that i finished running with scissors they can resell it as a used book and they were very appreciative he directed us to the national library the largest in the country 12 blocks further i told p that i didn t mind walking to it but since it was getting late we d have to eat lunch out ok our walk on the sidewalk was very much impeded by many street vendors selling everything from food to rubber feet for chairs we played chicken with an occasional taxi driver pedestrians do have the right of way in the crosswalks but sometimes when the cars are taking a quick right it becomes a battle of who is the braver we made one mistake and walked against a light what a dirty look the scooter driver gave me the library was a magnificent edifice but not what we are used to with cozy chairs and inviting seating encouraging us to sit down and read a paper or magazine this library still uses the old system of cards in tiny drawers plus the patrons request books which are sent down via a dumbwaiter arrangement after a quick trip around the we think city hall i chose a place for lunch with a huge pilsner sign unlike mexican menus we understood very little of what was available but focused on pollo chicken and milanese italian we guessed and pure per the little dictionary means mashed potatoes which we shared my hot tea was excellent really really hot water the food really flattened chicken deep fried covered with cheese and tomato sauce was great except for the instant mashed potatoes but we ate them up anyways total was 10 amer not bad p had a beer and that gave us enough energy to stop at ta ta for some olive oil wine 1 big bottle of beer real not instant which is here and which we ve been trying to cook as regular oatmeal peanuts prunes cheese and lunch meat asking for the lunch meat was a challenge which i encouraged p to tackle first he asked for turkey and actually said gobble gobble and then he asked for pollo with a negative reply we ended up with more ham which is fine the walk home was tough because of the heavy load in p s back pack it got much windier and colder as well so it was good to reach our little cocoon from pedro about the peanut butter if you like to go and visit a big super market like publix take a taxi asking to go to tienda inglesa

7121362 el nimo es apoyar el proyecto pero hecho de menos algunos puntos
7121363 el proyecto de ley que envi el ejecutivo al parlamento contiene lo fundamental para brindar una protecci n efectiva a los cet ceos presentes en aguas chilenas a pesar que las indicaciones realizadas por el senador horvath son positivas creemos que stas se pueden abordar despu s de aprobada la ley ya que lo importante en este momento es consolidar la posici n conservacionista de chile en materia de uso no letal de los cet ceos
7121364 chile mantiene un compromiso permanente con el uso no letal de los cet ceos en momentos que jap n ejerce fuertes presiones para eliminar la moratoria y reiniciar las operaciones de caza comercial de ballenas a gran escala en el hemisferio sur
7121365 cualquier retraso en la adopci n de este proyecto de ley es una amenaza para la protecci n de los cet ceos que navegan nuestras aguas y ser a lamentable que chile llegara a la reuni n intersesional de la comisi n ballenera internacional cbi el pr ximo 15 de septiembre en la florida estados unidos sin tenerla aprobada
7121366 las grandes poblaciones de ballenas manten an un ecosistema muy productivo actuando como fertilizadoras del oc ano austral
7121367 que aqu estamos viviendo un cambio cultural un cambio en cuanto a la conciencia ambiental de nuestro pa s tremendamente importante y significativo esto gracias a una gran cantidad de ongs que se preocupan de la preservaci n del medio ambiente y esta es una se al que da chile al mundo y a los estados depredadores
7121368 sea el inicio de un cambio en nuestra legislaci n y en la conducta de muchos sectores del aparato p blico de los ministerios que le dan muy poca importancia a este tema y obvian la legislaci n ambiental me alegro mucho de este cambio profundo en la cultura chilena en la defensa del medio ambiente en materia de protecci n animal y preservaci n de nuestra riqueza en cuanto a su biodiversidad
7121369 sta debe ser una oportunidad para regular la protecci n de otras especies animales como el krill principal alimento de las ballenas porque adem s el krill tiene un papel important simo en el equilibrio del planeta sin embargo sus poblaciones decrecen r pidamente
7121370 es necesario destacar los esfuerzos de la armada y del centro de conservaci n cetacea ciudadanos que trabajan desde hace much simos a os en este tema hoy esta preocupaci n ciudadana pasa a ser materia de ley lo que por muchos a os fue tema de ongs pasan a ser del estado las materias que se estaban haciendo por la voluntad de las personas nos estamos interesando en los intereses de la sociedad civil nos interesa la conservaci n de los cet ceos y de nuestros trabajadores del mar la ballena monumento nacional deber a ser promovida como un elemento central de nuestra identidad

7121410 if the kellehers did not eventually need the money he would make it available for another cause
7121411 this is the first time that weve had quality information about a sufficient number of cases to be able to do a rigorous analysis comparing specific genetic mutations with they way the disorder is manifested in affected girls
7121412 while rett syndrome is caused by a mutation on the mecp2 gene on the x chromosome variations in the mutation determine the severity of symptoms our analysis of eight common mutations that account for two thirds of cases showed considerable variation in abilities
7121413 many parents have found the lack of information about their daughters prognosis very distressing and will welcome a clearer indication of what they might expect in the future
7121414 our findings really emphasized how much variability there is in the syndrome and we hope that information will assist with earlier diagnosis
7121415 you are looking at a very rare piece of history
7121416 based in new jersey the rett syndrome research trust conducts research into treatments and ultimately a cure for rett syndrome and related disorders rett syndrome is considered the most physically disabling of the autism spectrum disorders and the leading genetic cause of severe impairment in girls this neurological disorder robs afflicted girls of speech hand use and normal movement it may prove however to be the first reversible childhood neurological disorder
7121417 the rett syndrome research trust will be structured as a highly focused agile and dynamic research organization aggressively pursuing the goal of bringing a novel treatment strategy to clinical trials within five years
7121418 rett syndrome strikes little girls at random creating what was thought to be irrevocable neurological damage
7121419 our mission is to close the gap between the recent scientific breakthrough demonstrating reversibility in mice and the establishment of this work to human application
7121420 i am a normal autistic and all i want is to be valued for who i am not be viewed as disordered the medical community saw a list of common characteristics in a group of people decided it was a disorder and slapped a label on it that doesnt make it a diagnosis it makes it a value judgment people with autism arent disordered they simply have more work to do than the rest of you and by working with them more is required of you as well dont grieve your less than perfect child or your less than perfect life instead celebrate the gift of each moment and walk the path of opportunity your childs life with bring dont think of your child in terms of what they dont do or dont give you that you think they should challenge your own perceptions about who you think your child ought to be before you harm your child because of your own subjectivity
7121421 zen of cycling so why cant we coin the phrase
7121422 a mind set and focus of energies directed at the day to day enduring care of those with rett syndrome that is euphoric in nature
7121423 its up to the court system now i do feel like we followed it through and thats what i wanted to do for stephanie
7121424 the rapid increase in scientific knowledge and pace of innovation in the field of rett syndrome research and treatment call for increased coordination increased funding and the development of a solid comprehensive research repository
7121425 by joining forces we are able to combine the unique expertise of irsa and rsrf to better serve children with rett syndrome and their families
7121426 both rsrf and irsa have made significant contributions to the advancement of understanding in rett syndrome
7121427 we are looking forward to the many opportunities that will develop from the merging of our organizations and our mutual determination to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those who have been touched by rett syndrome
7121428 i applaud the members of the governing boards of irsa and rsrf for their hard work and due diligence at this pivotal point in the history of rett syndrome it has been my privilege to initiate the rett syndrome movement and my greatest honor to see others who share the same determination and passion join the cause
7121429 continuing research to find a cure and treatments for rett syndrome is absolutely imperative but also expensive
7121430 this merger empowers us to leverage significant revenue growth created by shared fundraisers collaborative minds broader resources and combined best practices to create one strong unified leader in the search for a cure while providing support services to families impacted by this disorder

7121446 its almost been undone by its own size i think thats been the biggest frustration the sports have been fantastic the organization has been fantastic but its just missing that final ingredient which i call fun
7121447 the scale compared to athens is just totally different athens was more spontaneous there were more smiles on the faces of the people arranging it it wasnt so nearly well fun its too big it takes you an hour to cross this park
7121448 my personal opinion is that the vibe hasnt been quite the same as other olympics there are no common areas for people to watch screens its really hard to find out whats happening with your own country and the simple things that theyve overlooked
7121449 the lack of quality the lack of quantity its been appalling

7121461 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7121462 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7121463 confident that we can take this country in a new direction that we are ready to overcome the adversity of the last eight years that we wont just win this election in november well restore that fair shot at your dreams that is at the core of who joe biden and i are as people and what america is as a nation
7121464 i know my feet are in the right place and im proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states barack obama
7121465 the harsh truth is ladies and gentlemen that you cant change america when you boast and these are johns words the most important issues of our day ive been in total agreement with president bush
7121466 mccain will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7121467 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7121468 yielded to the very swift boat politics he once deplored
7121469 hell have to worry which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7121470 theres something about this guy theres something about barack obama that allows him to bring people together
7121471 its been amazing to watch him but then again thats been the story of his whole life
7121472 i watched with amazement as he came to the senate he made his mark literally from day one
7121473 campaigns for president are a test of character and leadership and in this campaign one candidate one candidate has passed that test
7121474 he took off and he was a bit wobbly but we just really thought hed be taking off and doing his usual thing
7121475 longstanding and consistent representation by the prosecution prior to the arrest and transfer of radovan karadzic to the seat of the tribunal that it would seek to join the karadzic case with the case against former yugoslav army chief of staff momcilo perisic which is assigned to pre trial chamber one
7121476 advised the chambers that it will not seek to join the karadzic and perisic cases
7121477 which is based on several grounds each of which is sufficient to prove conflict of interest of such degree that there clearly cannot be any question of impartiality on his part
7121478 it is understandable that judge orie is interested in having that sentence upheld and somehow validated which could be achieved through partial and biased conduct of a case against me
7121479 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia

7121485 lets remind everyone this is a video game and not a hockey simulation
7121486 graphics arent best in class which may prevent stupid people from not checking out this game
7121487 the same politicians who did not respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of serbia are now calling on russia to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia
7121488 the georgian attack on south ossetia was politically an absolutely unwise and amateurish step and by this saakashvili has lost the confidence of the democratic thinking world
7121489 the czech republic supports georgias effort to strengthen its sovereignty
7121490 the russian tanks on the streets of georgian towns remind those of us who experienced it of the 1968 invasion
7121491 russia might think its massive military operation against a sovereign state would pass unnoticed it is mainly we czechs with our own experience who should not tolerate something like this
7121492 it was an inappropriate reaction from the georgian government an inappropriate reaction from the russian side only followed
7121493 the warsaw pact tanks were not battling an enemy but a political concept and this is an attribute of weakness
7121494 the reason is that there is nothing in czech textbooks about 1968
7121495 this is not an ethno conflict as its presented by the russians
7121496 this is an occupation of georgia and the conflict did not start a couple days ago but 19 years ago
7121497 we are happy with the way the czech government and the foreign affairs minister expressed their feelings about the conflict on the other hand we are horrified by klauss latest statements and also by the czech communists
7121498 the biggest problem is not that top officials have different opinions
7121499 however it is highly problematic when they are not able to compare notes and speak with one voice czech foreign policy is a real cacophony of voices
7121500 we welcome the great advance that has been made between poland and the united states it is clear that the poles feel washington can guarantee their safety and we should not be afraid to follow in their steps and construct the u s military base on our soil
7121501 everyone can now see that prime minister topolaneks administration has been right all along in saying that poland will sign the treaty eventually

7121504 the will to succeed is important but what is more important is the will to prepare
7121505 the secret to success in life is for a man to be ready for his time when it comes
7121506 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that each one may receive the things done in the body according to what he has done whether good or bad
7121507 each ones work will become clear for the day will declare it because it will be revealed by fire and the fire will test each ones work of what sort it is 14 if anyones work which he has built on it endures he will receive a reward 15 if anyones work is burned he will suffer loss but he himself will be saved yet so as through fire

7121510 ive read that john wesley traveled an average of 20 miles a day for 40 years he got up every morning at 4 00 he preached 40 000 sermons he produced 400 books and knew 10 languages at the age of 83 he was annoyed because he couldnt write more than 15 hours a day without hurting his eyes and at the age of 86 he was ashamed that he couldnt preach more than twice a day he complained in his diary that there was an increasing tendency to lie in bed until 5 30 in the morning

7121513 everybody sees a real need for us to reform the way we do this
7121514 its such an emotional issue in those states that its very unlikely thats going to change
7121515 there are certain traditions in politics that are hard to disturb
7121516 this year superdelegates comprised 20 percent of our national delegation yet the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelegates were until this year
7121517 the role they played in our nominating process actually distracted us from the important issues we were debating
7121518 the ujc has unanimously decided to silence the guns in kashmir we have decided that no active militant will display weapons in public during the rallies and marches
7121519 we have to see what kinds of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
7121520 we met a lot of individual delegates of nsg member countries and had an opportunity to brief them on thursday

7121522 after the turn of events in the last 10 12 days morally and democratically i felt i should resign and that is why i handed over my resignation
7121523 there is no question of the project going elsewhere about 85 per cent of the construction is complete and ancillary work is beginning
7121524 then we will tell them how to go about it
7121525 the whole attempt is to see that the text of the waiver is so drafted that will allow the indian government to claim that it has virtually got a clean waiver
7121526 the draft submitted by the u s seeking a waiver on sanctions on nuclear trade for india from the nsg and the subsequent discussions make clear that the hyde act conditions will be built into this waiver
7121527 we have plans to invite parties such as the pmk and the dmdk to participate in movements to highlight peoples issues the viduthalai chiruthaikal katchi led by thol thirumavalavan is also on our mind they may not agree with us on all issues even if they share one common point they can work with us slowly we can bring together the parties that have issues in common with us
7121528 the attempt made by the dmk to demean the cpi m leaders is nothing but political indecency tamil nadu was able to get an unprecedented number of berths in the union cabinet since the left decided to stay away from joining the government

7121530 in my 34 year career i have never wavered from the notion that the only time progress has ever been made in the middle east is when the arab nations have known that there is no daylight between us and israel
7121531 so the idea of being an honest broker is not i think like some of my democratic colleagues call for is not the answer it is being the smart broker it is being the smart partner
7121532 we contract our foreign policy and that is a dangerous situation
7121533 do you think theres any reasonable prospect that the saudis are going to push hamas to recognize israel
7121534 we were the favourites to win the gold from the beginning after our quarterfinal win over the netherlands we showed that we were superior it was a shame that we didnt play our best game today but we won and that is the most important thing
7121535 this is incredible i think justice was made because we have a great team
7121536 i am very happy for all the moments i have lived here with this amazing group of people especially after all that i had to overcome to be able to play here i am going back to barcelona with a gold medal on my chest and i am going to work very hard for them this season
7121537 it is a matter of pride today we made history as a team and that is what matters to me the most
7121538 i felt we played well but we didnt score this game is all about scoring goals
7121539 section 498 a was added to the indian penal code in the backdrop of the growing menace of dowry related cases in which the women were subjected to cruelty and harassment and were forced to commit suicide this section lays down that if the husband or his relative subjects a woman to cruelty then he she is liable to be punished with imprisonment for three years and a fine
7121540 section 498 a has a wider spectrum and it covers all cases in which the wife is subjected to cruelty by her husband or his relative which may result in suicide or grave injury or danger to life limb or health whether mental of physical or even harassment caused with a view to coercing the woman or any person related to her to meet the unlawful demand for dowry of property or valuable security
7121541 an accused can be convicted of dowry offence with which he may not have been specifically charged and that an error omission or irregularity in the framing of charge by itself is not sufficient for upsetting the conviction
7121542 a reading of sections 221 1 and 2 of the cr pc shows that if a single act or series of acts constitutes several offences and the prosecution is not certain about the particular offence then the accused can be charged with having committed all some or any of the offences in such a case the accused can be convicted of the offence with which he may not have been specifically charged but in which evidence produced by the prosecution proves that such an offence has in fact been committed

7121547 but even if they want to debate it for a couple of hours let them do that after the resolution is adopted there should be an executive order reinstating the judges and the judges should be reinstated by monday night

7121549 the confusion arose out of regional differences in how moderation will work as there are different legal rules each region have to play by and at one point this looked like it may require the game to be independent in each region

7121561 muitas pessoas que correm para os lugares espiritualistas em busca de ajuda n o merecem ser ajudadas n o fazem nada para melhorar s querem que algu m tire o peso de seus cangotes
7121562 o ser humano muito falso mesmo vai pedir ajuda espiritual como se fosse um perseguido e injusti ado mas nem conta dos desejos cru is que carrega e que s o a causa de sua desdita
7121563 os obsessores s o tinhosos mesmo e perturbam muito principalmente se a pessoa lhes d fartura de pensamentos ruins na cachola e lhes d a guarida de suas energias
7121564 algumas porradas espirituais que as pessoas levam s o bem merecidas quem manda mexer com o que n o deve quem enfia a m o no vespeiro quer ser ferroado depois n o adianta reclamar
7121565 as pessoas olham muito para os defeitos dos outros por isso n o tem tempo de enxergarem suas pr prias mazelas mas os obsessores adoram v las ao vivo e a cores direto dentro delas mesmas de prefer ncia acoplados juntos e fazendo a festa
7121566 quem trabalha direito e segue seu caminho com honra n o precisa de prote o espiritual a luz de seus prop sitos j lhe protege e inspira por m em alguma necessidade a mais pode contar com a gente mesmo nem precisa pedir quem ra udo no rala rala da vida e ainda pensa no bem dos outros merece ser tratado com o devido respeito
7121567 tem muita gente fazendo coisa braba para os outros problema delas v o se ferrar mais cedo ou mais tarde tudo o que elas mandarem na inten o de algu m ir voltar para elas mesmas l na frente
7121568 quanto maior for m inten o de algu m maior ser a chusma de esp ritos perversos agarrados em suas energias
7121569 tem muita gente rezando para acabar com algu m ou para conquistar a for a o que n o merece ah eles v o se ferrar
7121570 a maioria das pessoas n o tem vergonha na cara rezam pouco pensam mal dos outros est o cheias de medo e ainda deixam a guarda aberta por causa de seus rolos emocionais depois ainda ficam se perguntando o por que de tantas coisas ruins estourando em suas vidas pequenas e apagadas
7121571 a grana que o pessoal paga em algum lugar para fazer coisa braba para os outros poderia ser usada para ajudar os pobres quem faz isso merece as porradas espirituais que leva e os obsessores que arrasta em sua companhia
7121572 o dinheiro n o capaz de comprar uma noite de sono com a consci ncia tranq ila e durante o sono que muita gente se ferra no astral tem esp rito brabo doido para fungar em seus cangotes e sugar suas energias e tem gente que ainda acha que pesadelo
7121573 quem justo tem a prote o que merece pode sair do corpo sem susto est em casa e n o tem o que temer pode voar por a e aproveitar as horas de recreio espiritual os guias espirituais os orientar o e os proteger o de qualquer coisa desde que sejam justos
7121574 muitos j nos chamaram de pol cia do baixo astral ou de lixeiros do astral inferior pela parte que nos toca muito obrigado mas n s somos mesmo ajudantes de servi os gerais no astral fazemos o que preciso e justo sem passar dos limites que os maiorais da espiritualidade nos determinaram nenhum de n s tra ra somos o que somos somos honrados e ningu m nos compra e ai de quem tentar nos enrolar com promessas falsas ou inten es ruins

7121579 before i tell you what we found id like to tell you what we did not find
7121580 we did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down the collapse was also not due to fires from the substantial amount of diesel fuel stored in the buildings
7121581 i think this is going to be the greatest movie of all time

7121583 i know youve got a huge passion for it and the buzz on wanted is great
7121584 id just like you to be a part of it i think thered be a really good fan reaction because people have said theyd like to see what youd do with it and id just like you to be part of the team are you interested

7121587 shes surprised to see him in a suit all grown up and handsome its no longer going to be played like a brother sister relationship
7121588 from the very beginning of my political work i was committed to preserving peace in bosnia hercegovina and reaching an acceptable political solution
7121589 entirely outside the proper range of discretion for the degree of participation of the accused in crimes
7121590 massive widespread systematic ethnic cleansing of a large part of bosnia hercegovina
7121591 i did not issue a single order i could not carry anything out so what kind of power can that be
7121592 there is no question that mr krajisnik was a strong vocal advocate for protecting serbian interests and sought to avoid serbia being a powerless minority within a separated country of bosnia herzegovina
7121593 what is seriously in doubt is any indication that mr krajisnik had the common objective to carry out the permanent removal by force of croats and muslims and that he participated during the indictment period in any criminal acts to effectuate the common criminal goal
7121594 it is an overwhelmingly expansive category including everyone who in any way supported the serbian point of view
7121595 the first instance trial court resolved it without recognising it without acknowledging it with all due respect without understanding that it was creating a decision with broad implications for political conduct
7121596 we believe that as a result it failed to understand the implication of the decision for many current conflicts
7121597 the trial chamber was not required to analyse or set out in detail the specific linkage between each individual incident and the accused
7121598 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia
7121599 frequently intimidated assaulted or killed in public view to enforce the departure of their families and neighbours
7121600 a final solution to the kosovo problem would be found in the spring
7121601 the office of the prosecutors position is that the departure of over 800 000 kosovo albanians from kosovo was mainly due to the actions of the forces of the fry and serbia and to the actions of the vj and the police acting in a coordinated manner under the command of the accused
7121602 this practice of identity cleansing was aimed at forcing people out and preventing them from returning this was not a humanitarian evacuation
7121603 why would civilians flee precisely to the areas where the bombs were falling
7121604 the evidence clearly shows that the nato bombing was not the reason for the departure of the population
7121605 clearly these were not legitimate killings these were civilians who were specifically targeted because they were kosovo albanians
7121606 the reports that he received from the media is sufficient evidence of notice that imposed on him a duty to do everything within his power to stop and to prevent these massive crimes
7121607 the caucasus is the kind of place where when the guns start firing its hard to stop them that is the brutal reality of south ossetia
7121608 i will be at comic con san diego on july 26th and 27th come one come all i am gonna be hanging out on a panel with a bunch of cool smallville peeps spreading the love

7121619 in the case of iraq the americans had a big strategic rethink about how they were handling it
7121620 that kind of rethink is whats going to have to take place with afghanistan
7121621 now that the situation is changing in iraq they are heading to a new front which is the one in afghanistan
7121622 were not in the blair kind of situation but it may come
7121623 in military terms i think we the french are pretty tough

7121628 hes not from our world he was wrong on iraq and the bankruptcy bill and hes kind of a blowhard and dislikes the blogs he blames us for the clean articulate controversy hes bad on the war on drugs he subscribes to the antiwar left not serious concept and he wants to keep residual troops in iraq
7121629 who brought us vietnam those who may have opposed the war because in the end virtually everyone did but who retained the basic mindset antiwar left not serious were by definition not part of this newly defined political grouping ergo biden never

7121634 last night on friday night smackdown the smackdown superstars were competing for a new chance at championship gold there was a series of qualifying matches to determine who will join triple h in the wwe championship scramble match at unforgiven the first qualifying match was a 10 man battle royal which included the wwe tag team champions zack ryder and curt hawkins armando estrada jimmy wang yang vladimir kozlov super crazy the brian kendrick smackdown newcomers ryan braddock and scotty goldman and funaki the big show was sitting at ringside watching everything that was going on but was denied a qualifying match by smackdown general manager vickie guererro he made his presence felt when he entered the ring on his own and was eliminating the majority of the superstars including the brian kendrick himself however kendrick was caught in mid air by his alleged adviser ezekial jackson and was deposited back into the ring making kendrick the winner and giving him a place in the championship scramble match at unforgiven ive got a feeling that the big show is going to watch that match very closely i wouldnt be surprised to see him wanting to challenge the winner of that match
7121635 another qualifying match saw the united states champion shelton benjamin against finlay the gold standard beat the belfast brawler thanks to help from finlays rival mike knox who came down and grabbed his son hornswoggle giving benjamin the distraction he needed for him to nail finlay with pay dirt and get a pay day for the gold standard as he has earned a place in the championship scramble match knox and finlay are going to meet this tuesday night on ecw and knoxs actions last night on smackdown made it very personal
7121636 then the wwe champion triple h was sitting at the broadcast table along jim ross and tazz to watch the final qualifying match between jeff hardy and the great khali runjin singh tried to distract hardy but the game made his presence known when he dropped khalis handler then nailing khali with a chair giving hardy the win and the last spot in the wwe championship scramble match at unforgiven after the match was over triple h stood in the ring talking about the championship scramble match until he was interrupted by kenny dykstra which led to him being on the wrong end of a pedigree right now on wwe com there is a question as to who might win the championship scramble match at unforgiven triple h jeff hardy mvp shelton benjamin or the brian kendrick
7121637 then in diva action maria went one on one with natalya maria won the match by dq when maryse attacked maria from behind for her broken nose she suffered a few weeks ago thank god michelle mccool came down and evened the odds summer may be coming to an end but this rivalry is heating up
7121638 finally it was the return of the undertaker to smackdown the undertaker who sent the rated r superstar edge to hell at summerslam vickie guererro underwent an attitude change blaming edge for her wrong doings on wwe superstars the smackdown gm was hoping and begging for forgiveness but the undertaker said im not here for forgiveness im here for your soul as he cleaned house with the family i think that the remaining members of the family is on the deadmans hitlist
7121639 were you more offended that the dog was growling at you or the fact that his owner hit him with weeds
7121640 yeah i heard on the radio that were going extinct
7121641 tout le monde le lit en priv personne ne le cite en public
7121642 it was a great moment and the feeling is mostly relief
7121643 yesterday i just didnt feel like myself today i was climbing back up getting it back a little bit but that last 200 still didnt feel like me it was a struggle a well fought struggle and im really really happy
7121644 the gold medal was the dream for me im happy that i have the silver and i hope my country is proud of me but this silver just pushes me even harder to come back and win that gold medal
7121645 i knew i had the ability but i didnt know if i really had it on today im really thrilled and i couldnt be happier
7121646 when you give people chances and allow them to come back from their mistakes great things happen and im a perfect example that you shouldnt give up on people
7121647 im just really happy its hard work for my entire life that came through now
7121648 i trained really hard for this and im just really happy that i finally get a medal in my individual event
7121649 my silver medal is gold to me because of all the bad things that happened to me this year
7121650 this is the olympics this is it why play it safe
7121651 you might as well put it all on the line and go for broke and it paid off today with a silver medal
7121652 i kind of fought my way on there and i thought theres no time like the present
7121653 i tried to make it a battle of pure willpower i gave it everything i had
7121654 the support weve had all year everybodys recognized that we had a shot at this thing such enthusiasm such support and thats a big motivator to us
7121655 we all say thank you very much to those who support it and those who believe in us
7121656 i was just honoured to be here competing in my third games for canada and to come out again on the podium with a silver medal i dont think its sunk in yet but im really happy
7121657 we never stopped we just kept on pushing every stroke
7121658 we had to find a little something extra to get beyond them
7121659 i knew that prilukov could catch me because he did in the 400 freestyle
7121660 i won a match to get the bronze and youre losing a match to get the silver
7121661 i knew i wanted to go in with supreme confidence in my abilities and not doubting myself one second thats what i did and i wrestled the match of my life and it was awesome
7121662 it was a tough race we tried to ignore the fact that we havent had a medal yet as a country and just focus on our two kilometres
7121663 we can come off the water knowing we had a great race
7121664 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7121665 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7121666 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7121667 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7121668 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy

7121717 gepriesen sei der der bei nacht seinen diener von der heiligen moschee zu der fernen moschee deren umgebung wir gesegnet haben hinf hrte auf da wir ihm einige unserer zeichen zeigten wahrlich er ist der allh rende der allsehende

7121723 die nusairia sind ungl ubige nach dem konsensus der muslime und deren geschlachtetes ist nicht erlaubt zu essen noch das heiraten ihrer frauen und deren steuer dschizja wird nicht verlangt da sie von dem islam abgefallen sind und keine muslime noch christen noch juden sind
7121724 o ihr die ihr glaubt wer sich von euch von seinem glauben abkehrt wisset allah wird bald ein anderes volk bringen das er liebt und das ihn liebt

7121738 i thought since we were married and i had a social security card and driver s license and military id i didn t think about the paperwork
7121739 they detained me at the airport and interrogated me for seven hours they were so nasty saying things like damn nazis i ve never lived in germany the next day i had to fly back with lufthansa they had denied me entry to the u s
7121740 the hardest thing was i couldn t get to the fax machine we had to wait for the mail to get out the mail leaving iraq isn t exactly fast
7121741 it is a pain coming back from deployment and after 12 months in a combat zone i come back and my family is torn apart the whole situation is mind blowing
7121742 she asks when is she coming back i don t know how to answer that
7121743 the first letter my husband wrote they said wasn t emotional enough the consulate confiscated my german passport nine months ago and they only gave it back last week
7121744 i haven t seen my daughter in nine months the only contact is pictures and e mails i m watching her grow up on the internet
7121745 drug convictions generally render individuals permanently ineligible for a visa

7121751 as a supplier of ingredients to the cosmetic industry my husband and i are well aware of how large well branded companies make product they cut costs they cut ingredients and they go for label claims 1 is all it takes their packaging is more expensive than the product in it and their definition of quality is questionable small businesses on the other hand are acutely aware of the need for high quality chemical free alternatives for people who suffer from skin sensitivities and choose to use premium quality ingredients without the passion and dedication of small businesses like our customers we would not have a choice to buy high quality conscientiously crafted american made products i want the choice to choose
7121752 there is no way of knowing how many of these were actually requests for ballots in the 2006 election
7121753 the quality of information regarding overseas absentee ballots is low
7121754 i didn t even understand how to do anything with being an overseas voter
7121755 i kept running into walls where i couldn t get any information eventually i just gave up and said i d try again next time
7121756 if they re lucky they ll be contacted in time to get that information and get it back
7121757 the likelihood is that it won t get done in time

7121761 fvap has been put in the worst situation of any military commander
7121762 they ve been given all the responsibility and none of the authority
7121763 fvap is limited in its ability to affect state and voting procedures because it lacks the authority to require states to take action on absentee voting initiatives
7121764 they get no carrot to entice states and no stick to compel them
7121765 i didn t really pay attention in the past and felt there was no real reason
7121766 i m more into my military career now and figured i d vote for what i feel is right
7121767 i squawked to gov arnold schwarzenegger president bush my local party after about three years of squawking i gave up
7121768 since no one gave a expletive about my rights then do you think i give a expletive about voting today

7121792 from a nice little house surrounded by evergreens at the other end of washington street he left to look for something he needed to find
7121793 it seems strange to call the m 1 im using la virgencita the little virgin
7121794 polished stock definitely a beauty at least as guns go
7121795 lucas was a good friend a person who lifted our spirits with his optimism
7121796 the american government spent millions of dollars fighting us but we had one american on our side
7121797 and with a little luck and good strategy planning on our part and bad luck to the cuilios army soldiers even the last phase

7121807 hed wear jeans and a beige shirt and a red bandanna but never a uniform because he wasnt a military type guy
7121808 i always wanted lucas next to me because he was an excellent shot
7121809 the m 16 is a good weapon a very versatile weapon the problem is that the comrades dont know how to use the m 16 you have to teach them how to use it properly
7121810 so here i be still fat and healthy on tortillas and beans
7121811 still grinning my grin still ready to swap my salvadoran butterfly net for an arizona fishing pole
7121812 he had a deep stare and he took my hand
7121813 we looked at each other and he told me dont worry eduardo
7121814 the first time i was ever convinced that there was no possibility that he could come knocking at my door
7121815 i really hope this be a way to expose the real danger we all are facing globally iran usa and russia hand in hand bringing the third world war
7121816 inside the political establishment of iran everybody is concerned about crypto jews that have a strong grip on the most influential politicians just by having corrupted them all or they know about their dirty past for example mohsen rezaei ex commander of revolutionary guard said last summer
7121817 we couldnt carry out a better operation at the mossad than to put a guy like ahmadinejad in power in iran

7121862 ongelooflijk het was net alsof gent op training bezig was zonder tegenstanders zo makkelijk mochten de bezoekers voorzetten en binnenkoppen blijkbaar was die gemiste 3 0 een mokerslag die nog harder aankwam door die gelijkmaker op slag van rust
7121863 onze start was dan weer geweldig we speelden heel gretig en gingen door op elan van tegen cercle we lieten de bal vlot circuleren en de gentenaars wisten niet waar ze het hadden na die inzinking in het derde en het vierde kwartier bracht iakovenko meer diepgang hij moest tussen suler en smoje verwarring stichten en in de ruimte duiken hij heeft zijn contract vervuld alleen jammer dat iakovenko niet scoorde vooral bij die tweede kans jorgacevic lag al op de grond
7121864 ik verkoos chatelle te brengen voor de leeggespeelde legear om zo chatelle linksachter thompson nog wat meer af te peigeren op tien minuten van het einde viel losada dan in zeker niet onaardig maar hij mist duidelijk nog vertrouwen ik hoop dat zijn aanpassingsperiode niet te lang meer duurt
7121865 daarin hielden we de bal langer in de ploeg en zorgden we voor meer dreiging
7121866 in de eerste helft zochten we te snel de eindpass de lange bal in de tweede helft hebben we dat beter gedaan door de bal langer in de ploeg te houden
7121867 niet dat we daardoor verloren hebben maar het gras was te lang dat was belachelijk als je dat accepteert als knvb neem je deze wedstrijd niet serieus
7121868 in de tweede helft heeft psv iets omgezet je kunt zien dat ze verder zijn dan wij psv heeft verdiend gewonnen op basis van de hele wedstrijd
7121869 gezien de omstandigheden ben ik inderdaad tevreden met het punt we lieten ons in het begin overbluffen door anderlecht maar na de 2 0 hebben we prachtig gereageerd
7121870 die hoge pressing van anderlecht in het eerste kwartier hebben we slecht aangepakt we hadden sneller voor een hogere aanspeelbal moeten kiezen en probeerden te veel combinerend uit de omknelling te geraken die reactie na de vroege achterstand maakt me blij zeker omdat we zo fraai voetballend en de match in handen namen

7122342 i think id have wanted to have me a lemonade drinkin woman
7122343 you know i want to drink some lemonade with my girl
7122344 yeah i had him in my car and i was driving him around and he was dying i had taken him out of the hospital see and we were driving around doing some things and he said he wanted a glass of lemonade he was having a craving i guess we was actually licking his lips and asking for some lemonade wishing for it i got him some thank god boy am i glad i did that because then he died
7122345 yeah i got him the lemonade which was not the easiest thing to do
7122346 the hell it isnt its not like we could be running in and out of places asking if they had lemonade he was dying in my car you just cant drag him into a bunch of restaurants but he sure wanted a glass of lemonade and i did get him one and he drank it he was damned happy too and 10 hours later he was dead so you see what i mean thank god i got him that lemonade because i really didnt know he was going to die that soon basically that lemonade was the last thing he wanted as far as i know
7122347 no i have never liked lemonade but henry liked it and i sure am glad i paid attention that day i was 21 and supposed to get him back to the hospital i did get him back to the hospital but not before he had his lemonade thank god i have no idea how id feel if id have not done done that found him some lemonade but i did find him a glass and boy was he happy in fact he said it was the best lemonade he ever had in his life

7122349 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
7122350 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
7122351 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
7122352 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
7122353 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
7122354 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
7122355 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
7122356 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
7122357 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
7122358 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy
7122359 those willing to sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither and will lose both

7122362 i will have half early and half later and some shrimp
7122363 im extremely encouraged by the investments many of our residents and commercial citizens have made following the flood
7122364 however i am also very much aware that there are many who are still struggling to get their lives back on track
7122365 i believe if they provide long term flood mitigation for the village we will see the downtown grow again
7122366 otherwise i think people are hesitant about starting a new business downtown
7122367 i think it has made us aware that these things can happen to us and that we should be prepared
7122368 now they just hope we can have enough business to recoup their loss
7122369 its important now more than ever that people utilize the downtown businesses
7122370 its hard to see empty lots where there were once houses
7122371 i think of the positive that someday we will correct the flooding problems and will see new homes on some of the properties
7122372 in 2006 we had five homeowners apply for building permits for renovations or construction in ottawas flood zone area
7122373 im afraid we would lose businesses and residents if it happens again
7122374 i felt inadequate when trying to meet the needs that were out there
7122375 now i have a deeper understanding of what long term recovery is needed for areas that have major disasters
7122376 the teachers are very excited about the state of the art technology that is now in the school
7122377 i think the school went beyond what they would have if the flood would not have occurred
7122378 in the long term we will see many exciting things happen in the community
7122379 if we had done anything to the trailers before receiving approval we would have ruined any chance of getting the federal money
7122380 it took nearly a year to receive the approval and the government said this was an expedited project
7122381 when the power went out last year during the flood we were taking the aep workers to different poles for rerouting sometimes we had to go through dangerously high water
7122382 this will allow us to maintain communications with the public especially through the internet
7122383 this is so important so people can make decisions about what they want to do in their homes and businesses
7122384 the village has enacted stricter laws to arrest and prosecute those who go around barricades
7122385 last year it was making decisions on where to put the barricades we had
7122386 do you want the flood walls to separate you from the river or to be designed in tiers and allow areas for recreation
7122387 first i stress that our industrial park is called highland industrial park and has never flooded
7122388 i also point out what residents have done who were affected by the flood developers are very impressed with this community and how they have survived and carried on
7122389 i truly believe those who put their faith and trust in ottawa will be rewarded with a better tomorrow
7122390 theres still work to be done but we need to also look at the progress weve made since the flood we need to realize the positive things that have come out of this experience
7122391 i had an uncle who worked in the coal mines and he used to attend worker conventions
7122392 this is the same thing you get aware of the issues have some fun hug and kiss and go to work together
7122393 this has made us focus even more on the task ahead
7122394 oregon will gravitate toward his message the same way they went toward barack obamas message
7122395 hes selected a running mate who doesnt believe hes ready to be president joe biden has been a leading critic of barack obama both in experience and foreign policy
7122396 i really think its funny that senator obama wants to get into a debate on housing he is not exactly poor either
7122397 this race is likely to be decided more on local issues like andy harriss terrible record
7122398 liberals in the first district have obama biden and kratovil for those who are not liberals the choice is mccain and andy harris
7122399 andy is proud to support john mccain and looks forward to getting him elected president

7122441 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7122442 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7122443 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7122444 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7122445 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7122446 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7122447 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7122448 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7122449 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7122450 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7122451 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7122452 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7122453 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7122454 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7122455 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7122456 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7122457 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7122458 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7122459 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7122460 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7122461 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7122462 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7122463 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7122464 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7122465 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7122466 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7122467 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7122468 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7122469 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7122470 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7122471 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7122472 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7122473 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7122474 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7122475 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7122476 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7122477 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7122478 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7122479 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7122480 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7122481 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7122482 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7122483 who are open to doing something on the production side
7122484 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7122485 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7122486 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7122487 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7122488 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7122489 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7122490 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7122491 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7122492 there is nothing else i need to do and no place else i need to go
7122493 woe be unto him who opens one of the seven gateways to hell because through that gateway evil will invade the world
7122494 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7122495 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7122496 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7122497 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7122498 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7122499 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7122500 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7122501 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

7122507 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7122508 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7122509 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7122510 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7122511 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7122512 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7122513 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7122514 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7122515 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7122516 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7122517 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7122518 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7122519 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7122522 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7122523 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7122524 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

7122545 the attitudes of individuals and organisations must be altered so that waste is not just viewed as being costly but as being socially unacceptable
7122546 since the beginning of the year we have noticed a strong trend for customisation
7122547 people are realising that old items can be easily updated
7122548 financially it makes a lot of sense and its so much greener too when shops first started producing these very cute pieces of clothing at enticingly low prices we all thought oh yes but that grab buy wear idea is losing its allure
7122549 im not a seamstress and i really do make it up as i go along
7122550 when people are really into fashion they focus on carving out their own look customisation is a way of putting your own stamp on fashion
7122551 i think a lot about where things come from and if you make your own clothes you can control that i buy a lot of second hand clothes and adapt them for the same reason
7122552 you dont need to be a professional seamstress to make a dress in an afternoon people think its more tricky than it really is
7122553 i often see designer pieces that i like the look of and i use them as inspiration last summer i loved phillip lims rose embroidered tops and worked out how to make them myself my roses are not quite like his but i had great fun
7122554 sales of our short courses in sewing skills and garment making have increased by around 28 per cent in the last year
7122555 sewing isnt the only story either we have added design courses such as recycled clothing to appeal to those who want to create a new look from charity shop finds

7122568 the process of curbing my desires and learning to live on less was liberating i soon began to experience the feeling of having unlimited wealth a way of life where your wants never exceed your financial resources
7122569 when i began the practice of writing down purchases it helped me to think about them more by having them on paper they were no longer in my mind or heart when several items are in a list like that you can more easily identify what is truly important and what is frivolous
7122570 i began keeping track of my monthly automobile expenses the car i was driving had been costing me hundreds of dollars per month in fuel costs at 12 miles per gallon i soon realized i could buy a more fuel efficient car and spend less on car payments and fuel than what i was currently spending on fuel alone so i was able to purchase a new car without spending any more per month
7122571 for its future china needs to become more international and the olympics was an important step in that
7122572 so it was crucial that the international community pay us due recognition
7122573 the olympics are a prism for the conflicts emotions and tendencies that are being worked out and worked out in public

7122593 i am needless to say underwhelmed by the choice of joe biden d mnba
7122594 sure hes better than evan bayh and tim kaine but thats an incredibly low bar most of what people say he brings does not impress me and his poor showing in his two presidential outings supports my conclusion
7122595 it turned out to be a portrait of how bidens very old washington ways worked
7122596 this a pick not only about foreign policy but also about the bread and butter economic issues that are shaping the election
7122597 with the addition of slow joe biden to the ticket obama has added to his unsteady candidacy an epic amount beltway cluelessness and arrogance unsupported by anything except frequent flier miles and delawares love for a chuckle headed fellow with a big smile
7122598 an admission that obamas inexperience has finally begun worrying voters and not just democratic power brokers
7122599 sometimes going conventional is not the wrong course during the past weeks of veep frenzy bidens assets and liabilities have been dissected repeatedly he possesses extensive foreign policy experience which obama does not he can do straight talk relatively well for a senator while obama has been accused of not fully connecting with working class voters
7122600 at the confirmation hearing for supreme court chief justice john roberts while other democrats got bogged down in legal jargon practically indecipherable to the average person biden peppered roberts with straightforward questions about roberts claim that he merely wanted to be an umpire on the bench who calls constitutional balls and strikes
7122601 its not very apt because you get to determine the strike zone the founders never set a strike zone
7122602 no one is giving us respect and we like that
7122603 were still the quiet team lurking thats a perfect sign for me just the way we have attacked this camp were not anywhere settled with our super bowl win
7122604 my saying is if you got 10 fingers why not fill all of them
7122605 im not satisfied with one big ring i want a few
7122606 are you satisfied you won a super bowl if anybodys satisfied youre crazy i dont think as players any of us are satisfied with our contracts how we played anything about us when you get satisfied thats complacency and in this league those guys go so fast
7122607 during the regular season we didnt feel we were the best team
7122608 when we got to the playoffs we got some confidence we played better football than anyone else and we kept that great confidence going we still think we can play better no one is giving us much credit and that adds to the fire and makes us say lets go earn it
7122609 a lot of people didnt think we could do it last year and there are a lot of people that dont think we can do it again
7122610 certainly tom has told us the next step is to go out and put it behind us we have the ring to remind ourselves how great of a season it was when you go through that type of season it makes you believe that you can do it again
7122611 every time ive been on a team that has won there has been a sense of urgency and i feel the sense of urgency here when ive been on a team that thinks were really good we end up doing really bad i think every team that has been successful has had something to prove and we do

7122617 the photo really does capture a moment of time and the spirit we had in the office
7122618 i could have had an office and a title from a respectable company but i thought this would take off
7122619 to have an equal partner in everything we do sort of plucked up and taken away is very overwhelming
7122620 if a soldier is worried about the health and safety of his wife and children back home he is a danger to himself and his unit
7122621 that is a huge huge lift in comfort to our soldiers in knowing that their families are being taken care of at home
7122622 when i woke up i about fell down the stairs because i thought it was a mistake it was so much more than we had hoped for

7122625 five years almost i was expected to win every tournament i entered so maybe now it changes a little bit
7122626 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces
7122627 maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having number one next to me
7122628 maybe ive been playing a little bit of catch up all the way through the season
7122629 it took away maybe a grand slam took away 20 days of practice that is a lot for us
7122630 i have to take it a little bit more step by step ive been very consistent even this year in grand slams
7122631 rafa has played great so he deserves the number one position hes in a way the favorite now all of a sudden even on hard courts because hes played so so well
7122632 ive had some legendary matches here from me playing andre agassi in the final in 2005 or andy roddick
7122633 the night sessions its electrifying and the crowd have always been very good to me
7122634 so especially this year i hope maybe not playing my best tennis maybe this year they will come out and support me and carry me through to another u s open win

7122650 our second quarter results reflect increasing chaotic trading card sales which we expect will ramp up considerably in the second half of the year
7122651 we believe that we are on track to meet our previously announced target of 20 30 million in chaotic trading card sales for 2008 we have made several scheduled improvements to the chaotic website including adding attack animation and sound effects to game play reintroducing the simpler 1 creature vs 1 creature game play for chaotic beginners and adding the more demanding 6 vs 6 game play for the more experienced chaotic players weve also implemented revisions enabling to operate on less technologically capable computers we expect that these initiatives will result in faster growth for the chaotic online community however in the short term expenditures related to improvements on the chaotic website and trading card company operations contributed to higher sg amp a costs for the quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2007
7122652 although chaotic trading card sales came in on plan the second quarter was negatively impacted by lower licensing revenue attributable to our core properties yu gi oh

7122733 look we know we have an incomprehensible messy system that even we ourselves barely understand but instead of actually fixing the problems and making our operating systems better well just staple another layer on top to hide the ugliness
7122734 much like the freely avaialble ccleaner which it is likely will end up built in to the internet explorer front end
7122735 computer programs for disabling the history and file caching features of a web browser and computer software for notifying a user of a web browser when others are tracking web use and for controlling the information others can access about such use
7122736 once upon a time a linux distribution would be installed with a dev directory fully populated with device files most of them represented hardware which would never be present on the installed system but they needed to be there just in case toward the end of this era it was not uncommon to find systems with around 20 000 special files in dev and the number continued to grow this scheme was unwieldy at best and the growing number of hotpluggable devices and devices in general threatened to make the whole structure collapse under its own weight something clearly needed to be done
7122737 or maybe not udev maintainer kay sievers has recently let it be known that he would like all distributors to be using the set of udev rules shipped with the program itself

7122740 i do think we are going to see attacks i think we have been seeing attacks already going on in the field

7122742 there are other scenarios that i cant unfortunately get into
7122743 indicating that the online underworld is poised to launch targeted attacks in coming weeks
7122744 the most important thing for people to patch are the name servers that back up their mail servers

7122749 focusing on important questions puts us in the awkward position of being ignorant the more comfortable we become with being stupid the deeper we will wade into the unknown and the more likely we are to make big discoveries

7122753 modern science has advanced since and this is an opportunity to apply modern science to evaluate these products
7122754 this is the beginning of getting drugs that are widely used in children in the over the counter world using the same modern approach weve started using for prescription drugs
7122755 this is how the agency can take these products off the market i think this signals the agency is going to apply a modern standard of safety and efficacy to these products and that is a standard these products cannot pass
7122756 whats important is that parents know how to prevent misuse and accidents
7122757 there was a complete breakdown in what really is one of the most important decision making processes at the department of justice
7122758 this was a decision that seemed to me to be dictated by a certain dogma or political idea as opposed to the facts
7122759 five years almost i was expected to win every tournament i entered so maybe now it changes a little bit

7122768 what might appear to be empty space is therefore a seething ferment of virtual particles a vacuum is not inert and featureless but alive with throbbing energy and vitality a real particle such as an electron must always be viewed against this background of frenetic activity when an electron moves through space it is actually swimming in a sea of ghost particles of all varieties virtual leptons quarks and messengers entangled in a complex m l e the presence of the electron will distort this irreducible vacuum activity and the distortion in turn reacts back on the electron even at rest an electron is not at rest it is being continually assaulted by all manner of other particles from the vacuum

7122794 finally i was at a loss to explain how this box improves upon the time warner dvr he already has except for tivotogo and a number of minor features that allow him to pull video off of the tivo for later use which is really all he wanted to do all i could recommend was getting the humax dvd burning tivo not a rousing advertisement for the dt sure it has an ethernet port and sure the little wireless adapter they sent us to play with is cool looking but i cant recommend this as an upgrade for current tivo users nor can i recommend this to a first time tivo user the analog rf cable tuner is just not useful enough to consider this an upgrade tivo users are a long suffering and patient lot they accept buggy annoying installs and land line dial up setups they play with tv inputs so they can record one show and watch another at the same time they change cable channels so they can watch hd content and record it at the same time they work around tivos many limitations and still stand by the product like a battered hillbilly yelling at the police on cops to leave her man be he wouldnt hurt nobody give us series 3 or give us death for many far too many in fact the cable companys hd ready dvr is getting more and more tempting and that is a sad sad fact
7122795 in reality if youre a cable customer its a real dual tuner anyways as most channels on
7122796 its marvellous shes made it to 50 now and shes still going as long as she keeps on doing the shows well keep on coming
7122797 i cant believe that shes only playing in cardiff and london out of everywhere in the uk im really pleased about it its good to have wales recognised
7122798 couldnt claim any major legislative victories during his tenure as chairman concerning indian country
7122799 he put forward a piece of legislation that would have added more burdensome regulation to our gaming industry at a time when our federal funding was at its lowest point
7122800 we were very disappointed because weve had a long history with sen mccain and i know that if he personally had gotten the message he might have met with us but we couldnt get to him
7122801 sen obamas going to have to meet with tribes on a daily basis to catch up with the 25 years sen mccain has spent on their issues
7122802 i dont think theres anything that even looks like a horse race in terms of intimacy of association and familiarity with the issues
7122803 sen mccain knows us intimately so he knows our strengths as well as our weaknesses so that could play good and bad for us
7122804 reasonable enough to see that it does them no good to coddle these criminals
7122805 he was indias best bet in pakistan we will miss musharraf
7122806 if he had not fired his judges and gotten bogged down in domestic dramas i believe we would have been able to make a significant breakthrough in a peace deal in kashmir today
7122807 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
7122808 still musharraf was a one man go to guy in pakistan now who do we speak to these are very uncertain times
7122809 five years almost i was expected to win every tournament i entered so maybe now it changes a little bit
7122810 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time it will be interesting to see how he handles it but so far hes been great and hes played so well on all surfaces
7122811 maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having number one next to me
7122812 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7122813 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7122814 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7122815 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7122816 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7122817 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7122818 judging by the conduct of mr tsvangirai i have no doubt that zimbabweans are a determined people
7122819 but daddy how would we be heard by the world if we do not speak in english
7122820 amid the controversies of the ministerial hierarchy the cpn uml will stay out of the government
7122821 we have not said we wont accept cpn uml leader in the second position in the protocol ranking we are ready to show flexibility regarding this
7122822 we stopped the bloodletting between shiites and sunnis we stopped the spilling of american blood
7122823 i fought the mahdi army i didnt fight any civilians
7122824 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
7122825 showing absolutely no indication theyre going to stop enriching uranium
7122826 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks iran is a threat not only to israel but this is a global threat
7122827 any kind of hesitation is being perceived by the iranians as weakness
7122828 you dont even give them 15 months necessarily you think its a more urgent matter
7122829 t he world cannot afford a nuclear iran and weapons of mass destruction everywhere in this region in the hands not only of states but also of terrorist organizations
7122830 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
7122831 responsible financial institutions and businesses worldwide are taking steps to avoid doing business with iranian nuclear and missile entities as well as with the front companies and cut outs the iranian regime uses to disguise its activities
7122832 these five nuclear and missile entities have been used by iran to hide its illicit conduct and further its dangerous nuclear ambitions
7122833 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
7122834 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
7122835 they are likely to use any bomb they build both because of ideology and because of fear of israeli nuclear pre emption thus an israeli nuclear strike to prevent the iranians from taking the final steps toward getting the bomb is probable the alternative is letting tehran have its bomb in either case a middle eastern nuclear holocaust would be in the cards
7122836 the issue with iran is not about uranium enrichment it wants to control the region
7122837 the reason for this is that they do not want people to panic
7122838 if there is a nuclear leak from one of irans nuclear reactors we need to have stockpiled iodine
7122839 kuwait must have emergency medical teams ready to deal with such situations who are equipped with supplies ready in all areas of kuwait who are ready to deal with every contingency
7122840 stockpile food and have alternative routes to import food into kuwait
7122841 kuwait would need to procure more trucks for this purpose
7122842 this would require oil tankers equipped to travel in shallow water during the tanker war this was done and proved to be very expensive
7122843 it was successful to maintain the flow of kuwaiti oil but expensive
7122844 powerful forces have historically attempted to control trade via this point
7122845 so they could control traffic through the gulf iran has had this intention since 1971
7122846 the maneuvers that have been carried out recently are held one after another to keep our armed forces prepared and strong fortunately these exercises have shown our great defensive capabilities to the world
7122847 security is a national issue the people expect our courageous armed forces to take even the slightest threats seriously
7122848 what we are talking about here are threats from outside the region
7122849 to all my arab brothers and sisters in neighboring countries i must say that our security is your security and your security is ours
7122850 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
7122851 reserves the right to take whatever action it deems necessary
7122852 would give iran international legitimacy for its programme which it currently lacks
7122853 the americans are not ready to allow us to attack iran
7122854 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress
7122855 it would not be right to talk about these things
7122856 threat to the whole world order and there are many actions to be made in the realm of intelligence and preventive measures
7122857 does not see an action against iran as the right thing to do at the moment
7122858 israel supports international efforts to place pressure on the regime in tehran to cease nuclear enrichment its time for the international community to send a clear message to the iranian leadership only if diplomacy is exercised seriously will diplomacy succeed
7122859 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
7122860 the people who cast the votes decide nothing the people who count the votes decide everything
7122861 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq
7122862 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilization development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behavior in scapegoating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
7122863 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there
7122864 there is a mechanism which is agreed between iraq and these countries on what these countries can do through the meeting of interior ministers of these countries through the expanded neighboring countries conferences which took place in kuwait and anther one that is going to take place in jordan in fall
7122865 we are going to continue these negotiations through diplomatic channels
7122866 we hope that any improvement in the relationship between iran and the u s will help the situation in iraq
7122867 it is noteworthy that despite these groundless allegations to date no single credible evidence has ever been presented to substantiate them
7122868 to the contrary several high ranking iraqi officials are on record stressing irans constructive role in the country and rejecting the solid allegation
7122869 the united states accuses iran because the two countries have as yet not resolved their outstanding disputes
7122870 the accusation is designed to stem irans rising regional influence which the u s itself helped to enhance by overthrowing two of the islamic republics most implacable enemies the taliban and saddam hussein regimes
7122871 in addition during these operations numerous jish al mahdi militia fighters and leaders of jish al mahdi associated highly trained special groups fled to iran where they received sanctuary
7122872 as far as the u s is concerned the accusation has the advantage of undermining irans image in the eyes of iraqi shiites by blaming iran for the nefarious activities of the discredited elements in the mahdi army
7122873 the allegations are also designed to provide credence for americas narrative that depicts iran as a deceitful untrustworthy and hypocritical power which while professing to support the central government in baghdad trains funds and arms iraqi prime minister nouri enemies
7122874 irans role in iraq is a byproduct of u s iran relations
7122875 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq
7122876 the security situation has improved not simply because of the surge but because of a host of other factors including the successful completion of ethnic cleansing in key areas and americas success in buying off former sunni insurgents
7122877 economic conditions the improving performance of the iraqi military the decision on the part of iran to lend greater support to the iraqi central government instead of shiite militias as well as blunders on the part of al qaeda and setbacks suffered by moqtada al sadr
7122878 theres ongoing cooperation between us on missile defense but theres nothing new on that
7122879 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
7122880 we will protect our land and territorial waters with all our might
7122881 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one

7122895 irans role in iraq is a by product of u s iran relations
7122896 when u s iran relations have stalled irans role in iraq would likely be unconstructive and when u s iran relations are cooperative then irans role in iraq might be cooperative it doesnt necessarily mean that the u s has to pull out from iraq

7122899 justifications and pretexts for those us and israel who want to drag the region down a dangerous slope
7122900 who didnt adequately refute claims over iraqs supposed weapons of mass destruction
7122901 israel must on no account attack iran speak of attacking iran or even think about it
7122902 belligerent measures taken by a nation to prevent passage of vessels or aircraft to and from another country customary international law recognizes blockades as an act of war because of the belligerent use of force even against third party nations in enforcing the blockade blockades as acts of war have been recognized as such in the declaration of paris of 1856 and the declaration of london of 1909 that delineate the international rules of warfare
7122903 as part of general international law and customary international law
7122904 the seizure of a french vessel is an act of hostility or reprisal requiring congressional approval the court held that congress pursuant to constitutional war powers had authorized hostilities on the high seas under certain circumstances
7122905 even an order from the president could not justify or excuse an act that violated the laws and customs of warfare chief justice john marshall wrote that a captain of a united states warship could be held personally liable in trespass for wrongfully seizing a neutral danish ship even though
7122906 the courts position seems consistent with a typical trespass case where defendants are liable even when they have a reasonable good faith but mistaken belief in authority to enter on the plaintiffs land
7122907 a blockade of coastal states that had joined the confederacy at the outset of the civil war the court explicitly ruled that a blockade is an act of war and is legal only if properly authorized under the constitution
7122908 the power of declaring war is the highest sovereign power and is limited to the representative of the full sovereignty of the nation it is limited in the united states to its congress exclusively and the authority of the president to be the commander in chief to take that the law be faithfully executed is to be taken in connection with the exclusive power given to congress to declare war and does not enable the president to do it or to introduce without act of congress war or any of its legal disabilities or liabilities on any citizen of the united states
7122909 vested in a congress of the united states which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives
7122910 to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and welfare of the united states
7122911 make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces
7122912 to declare war grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules concerning capture on land and water
7122913 fundamental doctrine of the constitution to declare war is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature
7122914 determine the existence of any threat to the peace or act of aggression and if necessary take military or other actions to restore international peace and stability
7122915 right of individual or collective self defense if an armed attack occurs against a member until the security council has taken measures to maintain international peace and security
7122916 we will be forced to react not with diplomatic but with military technical methods
7122917 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
7122918 we are currently working on a series of satellites that will be put into orbit within the next two years

7122922 es un d a muy desafortunado y triste para nosotros lamento much simo que no hayamos podido cumplir con el objetivo del d a aunque adriana estuvo muy bien preparada para esta competencia para su ltima competencia
7122923 ten amos mucha posibilidad de traer esa tercera medalla de bronce de carmona para venezuela lo sabemos por el nivel que estamos viendo y porque ella ya le ha ganado a todas las contrarias con las que se iba a enfrentar en el repechaje hubiera sido una bonita despedida de ella en estos escenarios
7122924 no entendemos este cambio de decisi n porque por reglamento es imposible no pusimos ninguna protesta ante la pelea contra la china porque las decisiones no son revocables no se puede cambiar una decisi n ya dada por los rbitros el deporte tambi n es respeto a los reglamentos respeto a las normas en ese sentido hemos sido respetuoso de esas normas pero no entendemos que pas con gran breta a
7122925 est n los testimonios del video creo que est muy claro eso el 90 de las delegaciones que est n aqu nos han reiterado la solidaridad porque consideran que adriana ha sido la ganadora de ese combate
7122926 lamentablemente estamos en china ten amos que habernos preparado para ese tipo de cosas que no est n a nuestro alcance
7122927 nos vamos con un mal sabor en la boca con un trabajo que se empez pero que no se termin por razones que obviamente no est n en nuestras manos estas son las cosas del deporte que no nos gustan pero espero que en el futuro se pueda corregir

7122929 everybody sees a real need for us to reform the way we do this
7122930 its such an emotional issue in those states that its very unlikely thats going to change
7122931 there are certain traditions in politics that are hard to disturb
7122932 this year superdelegates comprised 20 percent of our national delegation yet the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelegates were until this year
7122933 the role they played in our nominating process actually distracted us from the important issues we were debating
7122934 i would argue that if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top 3 4 percent of this country
7122935 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
7122936 to be fair to both of them rich is an adjective
7122937 economic science is not going to tell you that this is the cutoff point
7122938 if you set the bar at half a million youre talking about the top 1 percent of taxpayers if you think about the last eight years those are the folks who have benefited the most
7122939 give me a specific number is it 100 000 dollars is it 50 200
7122940 if you do surveys 95 percent of people think they are middle class
7122941 this is including people who are objectively quite poor and people who are objectively quite rich
7122942 i guess it says something nice about america that rich people dont want to act like theyre better than anybody else and poor people dont like complaining about how tough it is to pay their bills
7122943 it should come as no surprise that john mccain believes the cutoff for the rich begins at 5 million
7122944 it may explain why his tax plan gives a 600 000 tax cut to the richest 0 1 percent of earners
7122945 some of the richest people ive known in my life are the most unhappy
7122946 by a home a good job and education and the ability to hand our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one we inherited
7122947 ele n o ser apenas um bom vice presidente ser um grande vice presidente
7122948 joe biden um aliado raro especialista em pol tica externa com o cora o e os valores profundamente ancorados na classe m dia
7122949 um parceiro perfeito para trabalhar e recolocar o pa s nos trilhos
7122950 estou orgulhoso de estar ao lado do pr ximo presidente dos estados unidos
7122951 viemos de lugares diferentes mas dividimos uma hist ria comum uma hist ria americana
7122952 minha m e e meu pai me criaram me repetindo pouco importa o n mero de quedas o importante a rapidez com a qual a gente se levanta
7122953 senhoras e senhores essa a sua hist ria a hist ria da am rica uma hist ria de vontade a am rica na qual barack obama e eu mesmo acreditamos o sonho americano
7122954 figure out which of his seven kitchen tables to sit at
7122955 no matter how much power government has it never has enough
7122956 the most difficult thing about politics is dealing with people with really bad breath
7122957 once you create a bureaucracy it is near to impossible to ever get rid of it
7122958 if not 180 degrees from that about 178 1 2
7122959 i think its fair to say that bob has never been afraid to embrace controversial issues or positions and always had a knack for turning his actions into ink
7122960 the curse is that people view him as being this bombastic character who really is more thoughtful and has a greater degree of moderation
7122961 change the nature of the debate and raise the issue in the publics eye
7122962 it could enhance the things he enjoys doing speaking pontificating writing
7122963 whatever step would be required for bob barr as president to cut back by 10 percent the executive office of the president would be done
7122964 what is the position about the poor and helping the poor
7122965 if we have no government or little government whos going to administrate over these different programs lets say food stamps what is the view on things like that
7122966 youre not gonna feel guilty the morning after election night
7122967 theres never an excuse to not be pleasant and civil
7122968 hablamos tan s lo unos minutos era como una reuni n con un desconocido

7122971 washington congressional candidate jack davis in a speech earlier this year warned that increasing immigration from mexico could lead to a new civil war between northern states and mexican influenced southern states that may want to secede from the united states
7122972 in the latter part of this century or the next mexicans will be a majority in many of the states and could therefore take control of the state government using the democratic process
7122973 they could then secede from the united states and then we might have another civil war
7122974 asked this week about his speech davis said he no longer believed southern states would be prone to leaving the union in order to assert mexican control over what is now u s territory
7122975 theyll take control of the state governments and start voting themselves anything they want
7122976 many western new york farmers rely on migrant workers from mexico to bring in the crops
7122977 the farmers overall would be really concerned about his statement
7122978 hes not a regular farmer hes one of these big guys id call him a multinational farmer

7123013 sometimes it takes 20 years for something to feel important
7123014 but still it seemed even to me a little funny to be like back in the day 96 it just seemed like it was yesterday
7123015 but it was important to me this film got made when everyone was still kind of youngish i think the film wouldnt be as inspiring if it was made 10 or 20 years from now now the artists are not that far removed from the archival footage so its easier to draw connections
7123016 i always thought of the gallery more like a record label than something in the art world
7123017 it was an attitude it was a punk gallery i wasnt thinking about auctions or art collections there were no collectors the first time we sold a drawing for 20 i was just totally blown away that somebody bought it
7123018 i think corporations have changed since selling out was such an issue
7123019 corporations have learned over the years how to treat these alternative cultures
7123020 to teach the diy spirit to show the power of that not just in your career but in your success in life
7123021 their horns vary some are really huge and some are not as big and not quite as pretty he picked the right one thats for sure i remember one time on the set it started raining and we had her out there and we had these tents and she just walked in there like a dog hey how you doing pet my ears shes really really good
7123022 and im sure there will be outtakes of one of the first shots we did where hes coming around a bend
7123023 its just really slippery in kauai its all muddy and stuff and she slid and got a little goofy and her horn went lets just say up his derriere a little bit he stayed in character while he was swearing obviously to watch him do it was very funny
7123024 way way down inside honey you need it im gonna give you my love
7123025 i dont believe they had reason to shoot four times just like that nothing justifies a death
7123026 my brother said what are you doing with my brother let go of him then i heard gunshots and my brother fell to the ground
7123027 its so important to have a transparent investigation to know what really happened
7123028 but they havent taken the police officers testimony yet what are they waiting for
7123029 if it happens once it can happen again and it has happened before
7123030 they are treating everyone in the neighborhood like they are would be gang members
7123031 there is poverty and a lot of social problems in neighborhoods like montreal nord but instead of dealing with poverty like by giving money to community groups they give millions of dollars to cops
7123032 caravans of 10 or 15 police cars will come into the neighborhood all of a sudden and we feel very insecure because it seems like anything can happen from one moment to the next it makes us feel very intimidated to have so many police everywhere
7123033 they see a few young people and even if there are little kids around they approach them trying to intimidate or what are they looking for they are provoking things trying to take this to the next level
7123034 they kill people and theyre not even accused of any misdoing
7123035 so they get away with it thats what we call impunity and because of it they know they can kill people so they just keep on acting like they can do whatever they want
7123036 and things like this happen because the politicians are too afraid to control the police more and they will continue to happen if nothing happens to these cops
7123037 the cops investigate themselves and there are no accusations so we never really know what truly happened the cops are not even suspended
7123038 that such practices are common within the different police services in quebec
7123039 so it really sends a message that the city and the government are backing the police
7123040 even if they say they think about the family and all that but they really seem more upset that there was a riot than the fact that the cops killed an unarmed youth
7123041 i dont think he can lead montreal nord correctly because hes not listening to his people
7123042 if he was listening to his people maybe fredy villanueva would still be alive
7123043 these people want jobs houses families and are tired of police harassment
7123044 if you dont give them some options what are they going to do
7123045 the police are not here to help people theyre here to criminalize people and then they do things like killing people
7123046 this makes it so that everybody in the community feels alienated like they are being unjustly treated and thats one of the reasons why an explosion like the one we saw after the killing of fredy villanueva happened
7123047 a lot of police are good officers but they tolerate abuses by other police officers how come they dont say anything about that they ask the population to anonymously denounce criminals but then they let criminals in their own ranks
7123048 if we could respect the police the riot wouldnt have happened but right now
7123049 theres no trust no respect we know what happened that night and thats why we want change
7123050 if they dont stop police brutality and their answer to what happened is to put more police on the streets
7123051 then theres going to be more police brutality and more riots to come
7123052 as long as the couple has more homes than half sisters they could easily house one of the half sisters in each of the residences and keep them happy
7123053 however if the number of half sisters grows faster than the number of homes that could potentially lead to crowding

7123056 in the case of iraq the americans had a big strategic rethink about how they were handling it

7123080 at the time i wrote those songs they were very hopeful there was bleakness but i tried to put an opening of light at the end
7123081 but i wanted it to be straight from my heart to whoever listened to it what im saying has survived pretty well

7123083 its such an emotional issue in those states that its very unlikely thats going to change
7123084 there are certain traditions in politics that are hard to disturb
7123085 this year superdelegates comprised 20 percent of our national delegation yet the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelegates were until this year
7123086 the role they played in our nominating process actually distracted us from the important issues we were debating
7123087 the devil is in the details and thats not something to get into in a national convention
7123088 but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers

7123110 were the first ones in 41 years to enter gaza freely but we wont be the last we welcome the world to join us and see what were seeing

7123122 president wilson has made explicit promises and the democratic platform has made explicit promises mr wilson is now in power with a democratic congress in both branches he and the democratic platform have promised to destroy the trusts to reduce the cost of living and at the same time to increase the well being of the farmer and of the workingman which of course must mean to increase the profits of the farmer and the wages of the workingman he and his party won the election on this promise we have a right to expect that they will keep it if mr wilsons promises mean anything except the very emptiest words he is pledged to accomplish the beneficent purposes he avows by breaking up all the trusts and combinations and corporations so as to restore competition precisely as it was fifty years ago if he does not mean this he means nothing he cannot do anything else under penalty of showing that his promise and his performance do not square with each other

7123179 well i got a very funny e mail from a retired military officer in tampa who pointed out that most tire inflation is done at service stations and you pay for it and its actually a higher profit margin than selling gasoline so sen obama was urging you to go out and enrich big oil by inflating your tires instead of buying gas

7123183 and being afraid to take responsibility for things you have done and instead foisting upon the rest of us pathetic banalities because you dont have the courage to look at the world you have created
7123184 yes i think the fact is if you look at the amount of violence we have in games that young people play at 7 8 10 12 15 years of age if you look at the dehumanization if you look at the fact that we refuse to say that we are in fact endowed by our creator that our rights come from god that if you kill somebody youre committing an act of evil

7123240 what we used to call before the multicultural age facts
7123241 i am of course absolutely delighted we have finished fourth in the medals table but what we have witnessed here is so much more than just a statistical ranking
7123242 what we have witnessed here is a plethora of great british moments and it is those moments that have given us the greatest opportunity in living memory to inspire more young people to take up olympic sport
7123243 but lets not be in any doubt that what we have witnessed is no accident but synthesis of dedicated governing bodies who have really raised their game world class coaching athletes of the highest calibre who have also raised their game and unprecedented levels of funding
7123244 it was flowing and everything i was getting into my southpaw style when he got me in a hold and bit my chest
7123245 he came into me and i had my mouth open to him it must have seemed like a bite
7123246 i kept telling myself ive got to get through this
7123247 it wasnt pretty but there were bits in the fight when i boxed quite well even though i wasnt at my best ive got the gold medal and thats all that matters
7123248 i was disappointed with the booing from the cuban fans to me its a sign of disrespect and id never do that to them but being an olympic champion is unreal its maybe a bit cheeky but im going to ask terry for a little drop of champagne i havent had a drink for 12 weeks
7123249 how do you top an olympic gold you go on and win another one in your home town
7123250 im going to have to sit down with terry and my family because if people want me to stay amateur theyre going to have to come up with the right package
7123251 its in everybodys interests that our boxers do well at the olympics
7123252 people all round the country will have been watching this and hopefully the profile of the sport is going to rise
7123253 ive now got to go home and answer these allegations but if im going to carry on for the next four years im not going to put up with the ive had to over the last four

7123266 cercavo di scrivere un romanzo ma mi erano successe cosi tante cose nella vita vera che quelle che stavo raccontando nel libro non riuscivano a raggiungere la stessa temperatura emotiva
7123267 quello che mi premeva era abbattere il filtro della finzione allontanarmi dalla cautela che si cela dietro la dizione dellogni fatto puramente casuale sono partito esattamente dal dettato opposto questi fatti esistono queste persone esistono io esisto ho scelto persino di lasciare i nomi veri di coloro che erano coinvolti una scelta etica direi

7123275 a man with a distinguished record a man with a fundamental decency and that man is joe biden
7123276 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7123277 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7123278 im proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7123279 folks we come from very different places but we share a common story an american story he was the son of a single mom a single mom that had to struggle to support her son and her kid
7123280 i was an irish catholic kid with a father like many of yours in tough economic times and fell on hard times but my mom and dad raised me to believe my dad repeated it its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up
7123281 ladies and gentlemen that is your story that is americas story its about if you get up you can make it that is the america that barack obama and i believe in that is the american dream
7123282 we cant afford four more years of a government that does nothing while they watch the housing market collapse

7123290 they agreed notably on the urgent need to put in place an international mechanism under the aegis of the osce to replace russian patrols near the security zone south of ossetia
7123291 president sarkozy wanted the european union to play a full part in this international mechanism

7123296 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
7123297 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
7123298 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
7123299 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
7123300 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
7123301 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
7123302 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
7123303 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
7123304 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
7123305 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
7123306 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
7123307 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
7123308 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
7123309 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
7123310 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
7123311 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
7123312 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
7123313 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
7123314 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
7123315 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
7123316 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
7123317 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
7123318 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
7123319 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
7123320 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
7123321 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
7123322 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
7123323 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
7123324 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
7123325 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
7123326 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
7123327 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
7123328 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
7123329 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness

7123341 for years ramirez abadia and his organization made billions of dollars by exporting misery to the united states through drug trafficking and murder
7123342 his illegal operation included drug manufacturers couriers money launderers and accountants and he and his cohorts resorted to bribery kidnapping torture and even murder to further their goal of making as much money as possible now he will be held to account in a u s court of law
7123343 the norte valle cartel is a sophisticated and dangerous cocaine trafficking organization that for almost two decades has smuggled more than 10 billion worth of cocaine from colombia to the united states
7123344 as one of its leaders ramirez abadia oversaw the complex drug trafficking operation and use of violence to preserve the cartels power and control
7123345 today one of the most violent and prolific narcotics traffickers in the hemisphere has been extradited to the united states to be held accountable for his crimes ramirez abadia a long time drug kingpin now faces justice in a u s court of law
7123346 dea and our law enforcement partners in brazil and colombia successfully targeted and attacked assets having seized more than 700 million in cash and assets from his organization which put him on the run dea will continue to cripple drug kingpins by depriving them of their drug profits and operating funds
7123347 the fighting in georgia underscored the need to bring some foreign policy experience to the ticket no one does that better than biden
7123348 being from delaware myself i think thats pretty cool ive liked senator biden ever since he spoke to my 7th grade class during our class trip to washington
7123349 for a campaign that has consistently chided john mccain for being mired in the old washington guard and conducting the
7123350 but while biden 65 made strides during the primary season on curbing his legendary penchant for leaving no thought unspoken those who have watched him and listened to him over the years know the obama team will spend some sleepless nights wondering what he might say at any given moment
7123351 a safe choice even a smart choice but picking someone whos been part of washington for more than three decades is hardly change we can believe in
7123352 for biden the choice amounts to something like a political resurrection one that took nothing less than 20 years and one that has seen him evolve from firebrand to party statesman
7123353 just three hours after the obama campaign sent out its text announcement the mccain campaign rolled out its first ad this morning using senator joe bidens own words during the primary season about senator barack obama
7123354 i think it is an outright terrible decision on obamas part to pick biden yes he helps balance obamas inexperience on foreign policy but he also reminds people of it yes biden could conceivably be effective as an attack dog but biden is such a gasbag he makes the hindenburg look like a sack of rocks
7123355 barack obama told everyone he wanted a running mate who will challenge his thinking and now hes got one joe bidens tendency to speak his own mind and speak and speak is entwined in his dna
7123356 the thing is joe is old news very old news and hes got no executive experience to jerk around the national press for a full week only to deliver
7123357 after a week of excruciating suspense the big revelation is joe hairplugs
7123358 its hard for obama supporters to play the age card any longer as their potential veep is all of six years younger than mccain
7123359 this is a formidable ticket and a risky ticket and not a comfort zone choice for obama criticism will focus on bidens 1987 plagiarism bout his support of credit card companies he pushed the bankruptcy bill that dems now hate his comments about obama his racial obliviousness
7123360 the mccain campaign was quick to ridicule the choice there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden said his spokesman ben borritt
7123361 if not hillary clinton joe biden is absolutely the next best pick in my view no doubt many will be fueled to act out on this but theyre not thinking of the larger goal
7123362 i cant believe obama doesnt feel like hes sitting on a keg of dynamite with biden just hoping he doesnt go off
7123363 offsets and enhances the flavor of the sour patch kids

7123629 truth be told what we all deserve is not to feel beautiful but rather to be condemned to hell for sinfully seeking to attract the worship of our fellow creatures instead of living to bring glory to god god did not send jesus to this earth to die so that women could get over their self esteem problem and feel better about themselves no he sent his son to die to rescue us from our sinful futile quest for physical beauty and to reveal to us the satisfaction that comes from knowing god whether we are beautiful or not what freedom and hope is found in christ we dont need to feel beautiful about ourselves to find happiness in fact were better off not even thinking about ourselves rather god has offered us in jesus christ forgiveness hope freedom from sin and a joy that never ends

7123666 porque nosotros cedimos la iniciativa a necaxa nos sac el empate
7123667 ya lo analizamos y platicamos y la verdad no nos puede volver a pasar el equipo estaba jugando un buen partido teniendo el control del mismo y porque nosotros cedimos la iniciativa a necaxa nos sac el empate queda como experiencia s duele bastante pero no volver a suceder porque hay equipo para manejar los partidos
7123668 son una serie de situaciones que fueron para mal hacia nosotros las circunstancias no las supimos aprovechar en el primer tiempo y en el segundo bajamos la intensidad dejamos de tomar la pelota y ellos tomaron confianza el resultado es justo porque nosotros dejamos de hacer muchas cosas
7123669 before i tell you what we found id like to tell you what we did not find
7123670 we did not find any evidence that explosives were used to bring the building down the collapse was also not due to fires from the substantial amount of diesel fuel stored in the buildings
7123671 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
7123672 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
7123673 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
7123674 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
7123675 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
7123676 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
7123677 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
7123678 ojal y primero dios ya se presente la oportunidad de anotar creo que lo nico que me ha faltado es un poco de fortuna para lograrlo pues durante estas fechas disputadas se ha demostardo que trabajamos bien y sobre todo que hacemos las cosas como lo quiere el t cnico pero debo reconocer que si ma ana anot no festejar por respeto como lo hice hace unos a os cuando estaba en cruz azul y me fui a pachuca ya los dem s s los celebrar
7123679 siempre es bonito enfrentarse a algunos compa eros con los que conviv y jugu durante cuatro a os pero sobre todo es especial por todo los que se logr con esa instituci n a la que le guardo un gran cari o pero ahora defiendo a pumas y dar mi mayor esfuerzo como lo hice all
7123680 conozco muy bien la idea con la viene pachuca y s que ser un partido muy disputado desde el principio porque a pesar de que estar de visitante vendr a atacar en todo momento con un buen manejo del bal n y crear jugadas de peligro por las bandas ya que tiene buenos jugadores que mandan excelentes centros y que tratar n de sacarle provecho a eso pero nosotros tambi n haremos lo nuestro para quedaramos con el triunfo
7123681 estamos jugando con un guila de dos cabezas esperamos que alguna pique
7123682 ya sea bien que ascendamos o si no ascendemos traer otro equipo pero veracruz tendr el equipo que merece
7123683 no no se puede tener ninguna pl tica lo que hay es la voluntad y el proyecto por ahora se est haciendo todo el esfuerzo por ascender
7123684 claro habr futbol de primera nacional en veracruz antes de que yo me vaya
7123685 bueno lo preferente es subir olvidamos que coatzacoalcos est en la pelea estamos jugando con un guila de dos cabezas esperamos que alguna pique
7123686 es un escenario de futbol de calidad que queremos que vuelva a tener pronto en el nivel nacional veracruz por lo que hay que mantener la afici n la cultura y la presencia por ello creo que con la presencia de figuras internacionales y equipos como el de chicago se cumple ese prop sito esperamos que lo disfrute la afici n
7123687 tuvieron un fuerte tropez n en yucat n y espero que les sirva de buena lecci n hay que estudiar a todos los que participan en el torneo son muchos los equipos y hay que esforzarse a fondo
7123688 aparte de la circunstancia del calor y la deshidrataci n no nos dej tener agua en las porter a
7123689 nos anularon tres goles dos mal anulados y uno dudoso creo que el rbitro nos perjudic en los primeros cinco minutos nos saca una tarjeta amarilla y pasaron muchas cosas raras porque el rival no fue superior
7123690 s leg timos ven amos viendo la repetici n del video el de ariel gonz lez es dudoso y a mart n garc a primero cobra una falta que no es y luego en un pelotazo largo que estaba bien ubicado
7123691 eso siempre molesta porque adem s nos expulsan a un jugador en una falta que no era eso da mucho coraje
7123692 no quiero decir que nos acab pero s influye al cortar los avances y nos mete atr s en este partido el rbitro nos carg mucho la mano
7123693 eso parece pero el trabajo del rbitro afect no lo quiero tomar como un pretexto pero merm nuestro rendimiento colectivo
7123694 si bien no ha ganado no ha tenido puntos creo que ha merecido m s de lo que no pudo lograr y es un rival dif cil necesitado de ganar de sumar as que va estar complicado ya lo demostr cuando fuimos nosotros en pretemporada se hizo un partido muy dif cil muy din mico as que va a ser un partido complicado ya con el cambio de t cnico y m s ahora que est n necesitados de puntos
7123695 nosotros vamos con la idea de traernos los tres puntos tambi n necesitamos un triunfo como visitante no hemos ganado y queremos sumar para seguir escalando posiciones porque el torneo como siempre es dif cil nadie te regala nada entonces jugar contra indios no ser f cil
7123696 el equipo ha atravesado por lesiones de jugadores importantes tampoco es f cil pero los que han estado ponen su futbol como mario m ndez que est conmigo por momentos en la recuperaci n de la pelota nos hemos entendido bien
7123697 s creo que mejoramos en lo futbol stico y creo que se nos dio el resultado que esper bamos creo que esto da tranquilidad para seguir trabajando y para que el equipo pueda levantar el nivel

7123704 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

7123720 unfortunately we have no plan but to rely on the russians
7123721 the administration and budget office just havent provided the funds to avoid that
7123722 the concern ive had all along is that we just dont know what the geopolitical landscape will be during those years we have to depend on russia
7123723 you look at the situation now and relying on russia looks like a pretty bad idea
7123724 ive been saying for several years that once the russians have a monopoly on flying astronauts to the station they could and probably would use it to pressure the united states for diplomatic purposes

7123882 it occurred to me one night that we were doing our jobs backwards ringham recalled
7123883 we have two products the web based one and the newsprint one
7123884 opinion journalism especially depends on give and take and timeliness ringham said

7123900 no one is giving us respect and we like that
7123901 were still the quiet team lurking thats a perfect sign for me just the way we have attacked this camp were not anywhere settled with our super bowl win
7123902 my saying is if you got 10 fingers why not fill all of them
7123903 im not satisfied with one big ring i want a few
7123904 are you satisfied you won a super bowl if anybodys satisfied youre crazy i dont think as players any of us are satisfied with our contracts how we played anything about us when you get satisfied thats complacency and in this league those guys go so fast
7123905 during the regular season we didnt feel we were the best team
7123906 when we got to the playoffs we got some confidence we played better football than anyone else and we kept that great confidence going we still think we can play better no one is giving us much credit and that adds to the fire and makes us say lets go earn it
7123907 a lot of people didnt think we could do it last year and there are a lot of people that dont think we can do it again
7123908 certainly tom has told us the next step is to go out and put it behind us we have the ring to remind ourselves how great of a season it was when you go through that type of season it makes you believe that you can do it again
7123909 every time ive been on a team that has won there has been a sense of urgency and i feel the sense of urgency here when ive been on a team that thinks were really good we end up doing really bad i think every team that has been successful has had something to prove and we do
7123910 the u k situation i just explained that decline was over 40 or 50 years but they had so much money they could have continued to spiral downward for a long time

7123918 has deplored the recent killings of innocent victims and the resulting displacement of people in kismayo
7123919 he said that the fighting was to control the port for resource generation and not as portrayed in some places a political or other issue
7123920 kismayo is relatively calm today saturday but residents in janayabdale village reported new clashes in the area
7123921 the remnants of the clan militias and some of their commanders tried to cross janayabdale where they encountered an attack from the islamists several people were injured in the clashes
7123922 there was some sporadic gunfire overnight from friday to saturday but no fighting
7123923 the major battle is over but the militiamen that were dislodged by islamists may try their luck to regain the town
7123924 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france
7123925 they want to keep these checkpoints as we know but they have no legal basis for it
7123926 until now the us supported russias integration in the world community we have admitted russia to the group of eight and we have saluted and encouraged its wish to join the wto
7123927 our position is that they should pull out to the sixth of august positions
7123928 welcome to 2005 i figured id start off the new year with a new journal i started the old one years ago i wonder how long it will take me to make it through this one how many tears will stain its pages how many words will not be able to express some joy in my heart how many foolish mistakes will be recorded and all the while it will continue to be a record of gods faithfulness in my life

7123938 yes its violent we dont try to hide that but as publishers we see it as a fantasy game its fantasy violence its over the top its cartoony we also take the violence very seriously we are working with the age rating boards with pegi and with bbfc were not at the end of the games development but were working with them now to make sure that we dont go over the top the game has been banned in germany theres no getting around that unfortunately but we are taking it seriously and were going to make sure that this game is rated for the appropriate audience

7123942 we thought we were almost going to have a freeway baby
7123943 e stato terribile non auguro a nessuna di essere accusata dellomicidio del proprio uomo
7123944 se pure avevano una coscienza pi o meno rivoluzionaria sofri e compagni devono averla messa a tacere dai tempi gi sospetti in cui accettarono di fare i consiglieri della banda craxi d una vaga nausea assistere allo spettacolo di questi cinquantenni malvissuti sparsi fra le corti dei potentati italiani che si ricompattano nellomert mafiosa ogni volta che la magistratura riesuma un cadavere scomodo si tratti di alceste campanile il commissario calabresi o il povero rostagno
7123945 c la morte ci sono le strane morti di cui parla anche sofri nei suoi articoli andrea pardo la rinaldi queste morti misteriose anche mauro rostagno non morto per lupara non morto per lupara stato fatto tacere sicuramente ma alla vigilia di un interrogatorio per questi fatti convocato dal giudice non morto per lupara questa una storia macabra ancora da scrivere ma questi erano gli uomini loro mafiosi perch il loro linguaggio mafioso io dico che la causa della morte di rostagno una mia supposizione nei fatti di questo processo non nella comunicazione giudiziaria perch non morto per lupara
7123946 signor presidente metto a verbale che abbandono laula delludienza il difensore di sofri abbandona ludienza perch laccusa di assassinio a una presunta mafia di lotta continua e quindi indirettamente allo stesso adriano sofri laccusa di assassinio di mauro rostagno eccede i limiti della difesa di parte civile e rende insopportabile ascoltare criticare una discussione in questi termini
7123947 avvocato gentili lavvocato ligotti ha fatto unaffermazione e ovviamente se ne assume la sua
7123948 sono stato sbattuto in prima pagina come si usa dire a causa di una comunicazione giudiziaria per lomicidio calabresi ad un mese dalla data della comunicazione non mi noto di che cosa sono accusato in base a che cosa chi mi accusa c tempo non c fretta questa la voce che mi arriva dal palazzo il giudice pomarici pm in ferie bene aspetter ho imparato tante cose nella vita anche ad aspettare ma intanto qualche spiritoso si fatto strane idee sul nio conto che vorrei subito dissipare per esempio si fatto lidea che questa vicenda mi ha messo un bavaglio alla bocca insomma che tutto ci mi ha dato una calmata purtroppo non cos non mi sono calmato perch non ero agitato neanche prima e non ho sterzato da nessuna parte perch tendo ad andare dritto per la mia strada e sono anche cocciuto da quasi ventanni vivo in sicilia dove ho insegnato nelle universit mi nata una figlia ho famiglia parenti affetti ho messo radici e non sar facile a nessuno strapparmele non sono di passaggio ho intenzione se dio massiste di vedere nascere qui i miei nipotini e di finire dimbiancare la mia barba e i miei capelli sotto questo sole in questa terra spero sar fatta luce anche sullassassinio di calabresi e anche su quello dellanarchico ferroviere pinelli che vol gi dal quarto piano di quella questura visto che ne sono imputato vorrei anche essere sentito ma non ho fretta coi comodi del signor pm pomarici visto che anche lui ha diritto alle sue ferie e io alle mie qualcuno avr avuto i suoi motivi per tirarmi dentro a questa sporca faccenda ho tutto il diritto di sapere chi e perch poffarbacco ed anche di venirne fuori con totale restituzione dellonore mio e quello di lotta continua che se pur lontana passata e chiusa una fetta della mia vita cui non ho motivo alcuno di rinunciare grazie spero solo che non mi tocchi il destino del mio amico adriano sofri su cui il giudice ha scritto che non ci sono prove ma anche che non ci saranno neppure in futuro n si potranno trovare beh allegria
7123949 le due piste quella della faida interna a saman e quella che porta al processo calabresi non si escludono a vicenda dietro la morte di rostagno c qualcosa di grosso e la mafia non centra niente perch insistere sulla mafia secondo me continua il depistaggio
7123950 fu riina a dirmi che eravamo stati noi che era stata cosa nostra a uccidere rostagno
7123951 mosso per salvarlo non volevo che si facesse troppo rumore con quellomicidio
7123952 non diceva rostagno di non volere un ghetto doro in un mondo di merda doro non ha avuto nulla del resto gliene rovesciano addosso a lui e ai suoi a palate
7123953 se un nesso c fra processo calabresi e assassinio di rostagno esso sta nellinfluenza che un addebito infamante quanto infondato pu aver avuto sugli assassini nel far ritenere mauro pi isolato e debole
7123954 scartai subito la pista mafiosa dietro a molte morti che sono passate per storie di corna cera cosa nostra dietro a tante storie che si diceva di mafia cerano le corna

7124019 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
7124020 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7124021 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
7124022 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs hardball echoing comments he made earlier in the day at an event promoting his book at the national press club
7124023 the biden for president campaign today congratulated sen barack obama for arriving at a number of sen bidens long held views on combating al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan
7124024 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7124025 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7124026 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7124027 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7124028 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7124029 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7124030 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7124031 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7124032 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7124033 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7124034 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7124035 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7124036 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7124037 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7124038 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7124039 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7124040 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7124041 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7124042 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7124043 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7124044 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7124045 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7124046 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7124047 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7124048 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7124049 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7124050 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7124051 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7124052 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7124053 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7124054 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7124055 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7124056 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7124057 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7124058 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7124059 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7124060 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7124061 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7124062 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7124063 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7124064 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7124065 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7124066 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7124067 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7124068 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7124069 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7124070 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7124071 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7124072 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7124073 he has got domestic problems which he feels he cannot clear up playing in plymouth we are circulating to clubs to see if we have any takers
7124074 i am disappointed but the quicker it is sorted out the better
7124075 it is time sensitive with the transfer window closing in nine days but jermaine has to understand he has a value and like anybody else that value has to be met
7124076 it has been bubbling for quite a long time but i have come to understand it over the last 10 days after jermaine came to see me
7124077 it had been happening since the end of last season and he has decided that a move away from plymouth would benefit his domestic problems
7124078 he is a big boy and he will have to get on with it if he stays
7124079 if we can move him on we move him on and that may clear some money to bring in two strikers we need good championship players
7124080 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7124081 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7124082 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7124083 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7124084 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7124085 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7124086 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7124087 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7124088 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7124089 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7124090 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7124091 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7124092 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7124093 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7124094 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7124095 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7124096 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7124097 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7124098 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7124099 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7124100 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7124101 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7124102 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7124103 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7124104 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7124105 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7124106 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7124107 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7124108 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7124109 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7124110 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7124111 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7124112 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7124113 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7124114 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7124115 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7124116 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7124117 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7124118 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7124119 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

7124121 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7124122 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7124123 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7124124 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7124125 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7124126 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7124127 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7124128 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7124129 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7124130 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7124131 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7124132 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7124133 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7124134 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7124135 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7124136 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7124137 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7124138 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7124139 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7124140 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7124141 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7124142 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7124143 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7124144 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7124145 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7124146 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7124147 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7124148 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7124149 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7124150 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7124151 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7124152 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7124153 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7124154 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7124155 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7124156 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7124157 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7124158 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7124159 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

7124167 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7124168 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7124169 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7124170 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7124171 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7124172 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7124173 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones

7124191 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7124192 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7124193 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7124194 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7124195 it was a brief conversation theyve known each other for years
7124196 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7124197 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7124198 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president

7124204 el a o que viene es un a o important simo es el a o de las elecciones legistivas tenemos un cuerpo que nos tiene que representar a nostros que es el congreso y tenemos que tener mayor a autom tica de una multipartidaria
7124205 el sistema es el mismo todo es discrecional tanto sea en trigo tanto sea en carne tanto sea en leche
7124206 si todo es una mentira c mo quiere que haya alg n tipo de confianza
7124207 m s que una provocaci n parece una alcahueter a una b squeda de m ritos
7124208 no tenemos nada demasiado importante contra guillermo moreno como persona y como funcionario ac el problema es la ratificaci n de la pol tica es mucho m s importante haber escuchado a la presidenta cristina kirchner que har a todo de nuevo que remuevan o no a un funcionario

7124210 ha habido distintos intentos de destruir la unidad del campo
7124211 valoramos aquel voto de julio cobos de los senadores de los diputados pero queremos dejar claro que el problema agropecuario no se resolvi
7124212 si no se puede avanzar est claro que uno no dinamita ese puente
7124213 pero hay que ir al congreso y ah hay muchas cosas que quedaron pendientes hay infinidad de temas por trabajar
7124214 est en una situaci n cada vez m s complicada
7124215 we went up in a cable car and a toboggan down so that was really good fun
7124216 sometimes you see all these people walking around and its like oh my god i just walked past an olympic gold medalist
7124217 everything i imagined the olympics to be imagine that times 10 and thats how it feels to be in the olympics
7124218 some of the spirit of self negation self discipline sense of humour responsibility helpful ness to others loyalty and patriotism which go to make character
7124219 the reason we find the concept of character difficult is because of class conflict in british society
7124220 there was a sense that good character was handed down from a patrician class to the great unwashed
7124221 a refusal to make judgments about what is good and bad behaviour right and wrong
7124222 a young student ponders whether to spend the evening revising at her desk or to go out with friends how much to sacrifice tonight for a remote future when to stop having fun but also when to stop being serious conventions expectations and institutions have built up gradually over decades and centuries to form a stock of equipment available to deal with her problem sources and strategies of self control both cognitive and social take time to develop
7124223 over time poverty has become more associated with differences in character development
7124224 so while in the past a poor deprived child would have about the same chance of developing a good character as a more affluent one our research suggests that children who were born into deprivation in the 1970s as opposed to the late 1950s were much less likely to develop good character than more affluent groups
7124225 theres an interaction between your genetic predisposition and the way you turn out according to the way youre raised
7124226 when it comes to being antisocial aggressive stealing and lying the interaction is a big one if you have poor self control and a rather twitchy irritable temperament and youre brought up in a harsh way its bad news for that group the rate of criminality aged 17 is about 40 but if you have that twitchy character and youre brought up in a reasonably calm soothing way you will do well
7124227 financial poverty is a factor but not a central one
7124228 i am fond of saying poverty of what and actually it seems to be poverty of the parent child experience that leads to poor child outcomes rather than poverty of a material kind
7124229 the danger is that many people in deprived areas are being denied work because of a lack of cultural capital
7124230 in glasgow 50 of jobs are now filled by commuters from the middle class suburbs
7124231 it is regular time with the same adult over an extended period so you respect them and learn from them which is why things like the scout movement are so effective because youre progressing youre ageing through the institution and there tends to be a very good staying on rate for the adult workers so you have a lot of interaction with the same adult over a long period of time
7124232 ihr sohn ist hochbegabt im zeichnen k rzlich hat er eine blume an die hauswand gemalt die hat so echt ausgesehen da unser g rtner sie gegossen hat

7124234 going through winthrop wa checking it out its a nice little town
7124235 we knew about this hamas attempt to create a pr event at sea for weeks
7124236 we knew whos on these boats and what they contain and therefore we decided weeks ago to allow them to come into gaza they were not carrying weapons and had only a handful of equipment for the hearing impaired
7124237 many people thought these boats would make a significant contribution to break the siege not only politically but also in terms of bringing in goods equipment food and medicine
7124238 however once it turned out these boats contained no food and only activists most people left the beach disappointed
7124239 one cannot place any responsibility on the palestinian authority for these theatrics as the pa has no control of gaza
7124240 handful of provocateurs seeking a public relations stunt who initiated a political protest aimed at boosting hamas regime of horrors in gaza
7124241 what kind of contribution does this journey make to the promotion of ideas of reconciliation and compromise none
7124242 attests to the israeli distress caused by this international peace initiative
7124243 they were looking for anything they could find to make a news story out of thin air not one idf ship was ever seen by these protesters
7124244 at the end of the day we do need to lie
7124245 if we make a mistake we will be the first to admit it while the international media sees day after day pure propaganda coming from gaza the international media has come to learn the difference between democracy and free speech at work in israel and hamas terrorism in gaza journalists have long memories and many remember wall street journal reporter daniel pearl and the recent kidnappings of journalists in gaza by hamas
7124246 they are very brave they are very strong i am proud of them
7124247 you cant go into a dunkin donuts or a 7 11 without a slight indian accent these days

7124254 a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7124255 into the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics he once so deplored
7124256 hell have to figure out which of his seven kitchen tables to sit at
7124257 he strengthens baracks foreign policy experience and can attack john mccain like barack cant because barack is the kind of individual that believe in being above the fray
7124258 but i knew that wasnt going to happen it didnt seem like a good fit
7124259 i guess this is what he has to do to combat the constant attacks of hes too young too inexperienced
7124260 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7124261 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class he has stared down dictators and spoken out for american cops and firefighters
7124262 instead night after night week after week year after year he returned home to wilmington on a lonely amtrak train when his senate business was done he raised his boys first as a single dad then alongside his wonderful wife jill
7124263 to have this in your hand and not have to carry your laptop with you to all your classes is going to be awesome
7124264 honestly it boggles my mind the capabilities of this thing
7124265 jika anda ingin bermain di level atas anda harus memulai pertandingan dengan sikap dan kepribadian yang tepat
7124266 kami tidak melakukan hal itu dan ini sebuah pelajaran yang bagus ini adalah jenis pertandingan di mana anda tak boleh melakukan sebuah kesalahan di lini belakang atau saat menghadapi bola mati
7124267 ini kekalahan yang tidak mengenakkan tapi saya harus berkata adil bahwa fulham bermain sangat baik
7124268 mereka selalu tajam termotivasi bertahan dengan bagus sekali di babak pertama lini tengah kami didominasi mereka
7124269 saya pikir kami sedikit tak beruntung pekan lalu kalah 1 2 dari hull city red jika kami menampilkan permainan terbaik kami seperti di babak pertama ini sangatlah mungkin bagi kami untuk mengalahkan tim manapun
7124270 too good to throw away but i dont want it in my closet apartment anymore
7124271 every so often we see reports of this kind in the saudi media i believe its part of the saudi demonization of relations with israel
7124272 este es un proceso t ctico estrat gico que tiene la derecha ellos paulatinamente van a ir poniendo en la mesa del debate el enfrentamiento y la provocaci n con un objetivo final que es la desintegraci n del pa s
7124273 yo nunca me he negado a que el pa s debata si quiere vivir entre un modelo centralista autonomista o federalista y adem s que hay muy poca diferencia
7124274 for the first time we are going to have some money coming off of the devon project that will allow us to really fix up the myriad gardens
7124275 it is a great botanical garden now but there are a lot of things we can do here to make it used by a lot more citizens than it is now
7124276 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7124277 figure out which of the 7 kitchen tables to sit at
7124278 on the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day i ve been totally in agreement and support of president bush
7124279 you cant change american when you supported bushs policies 95 percent of the time
7124280 we felt like this was a good way to start the season
7124281 it is a real confidence booster to beat a team like penn state who played in the national championship game last season we played well
7124282 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7124283 once instructed us to be sure to put your feet in the right place and then stand firm today in springfield i know my feet are in the right place and im proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7124284 he took off and he was a bit wobbly but we just really thought hed be taking off and doing his usual thing
7124285 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7124286 i think that this is a time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like
7124287 one of the very big mistakes early on was that he didnt have enough troops on the ground particularly after the initial victory and thats still the case
7124288 theres not enough force on the ground to mount a real counterinsurgency
7124289 embrace change value life long learning allow your passions to show and if at any moment you are no longer having fun or gaining something personally important from doing this important work step back for a bit and re evaluate
7124290 i was never anorexic so i was never that skinny
7124291 not on purpose youd be on shoots with bad food or get on a plane and the food would be so disgusting you couldnt eat it
7124292 you go to a show and theres no food at all so if youre doing shows back to back you can forget eating
7124293 i remember standing up in the bath one day and there was a mirror in front of me and i was so thin i hated it
7124294 and most of them are so hard you can knock on them like a door i m not into them
7124295 i mean if i got all saggy like the sacks some women have after they have children i d have them done
7124296 i think we should be acquiring and accumulating all the data that is appropriate for possibly bringing criminal charges against members of this administration
7124297 for those of us who live close to the border the humanitarian crisis is not an abstraction
7124298 if its the simple things that matter why dont we live our lives that way
7124299 he had stopped taking the drug for two months then resumed its use for three weeks before the murder
7124300 this study suggests that androgenic anabolic steroid use significantly increases the frequency and severity of motley disorder and adds to the growing indicate of the dangers of their use
7124301 la mano viene muy mal en el ltimo a o y medio nos aumentaron el alquiler un 120 a fin de a o renovamos el contrato y si nos suben mucho vamos a tener que cerrar
7124302 hace tres meses renovamos el contrato de alquiler por el doble de lo que est bamos pagando en realidad nos quer an cobrar m s pero pudimos arreglar un incremento del 100 con una actualizaci n cada 6 meses realmente es una locura lo normal ser a un aumento del 20 o hasta un 30 por estar sobre la peatonal pero no lo que est n cobrando
7124303 con el conflicto del campo comenz una merma en las ventas que se prolonga hasta estos d as por eso la incidencia del alquiler comienza a ser mayor y hay una tendencia a dejar los locales de san mart n por otros m s econ micos
7124304 estamos pagando 10 mil y ahora nos piden 15 mil no sabemos qu hacer si renovar y ver cu nto tiempo podemos aguantar con esos costos o directamente vender el local y cerrarlo
7124305 los propietarios se aprovechan porque saben que si me voy viene otro detr s de m interesado en alquilar
7124306 esto no va de la mano de la inflaci n
7124307 los propietarios piensen que porque uno tiene el boliche lleno puede pagar cualquier precio
7124308 ahora estamos en una meseta los precios han ido aumentando porque la demanda de locales comerciales era mayor que la oferta pero ahora que esta situaci n se est revirtiendo el mercado va a empezar a presionar para que bajen los precios
7124309 un propietario quiere sacar una renta m nimamente acorde con el capital invertido pero si por otra parte la actividad econ mica ha ca do y no hay ocupantes dispuestos a pagar esos alquileres habr que negociar el mejor negocio siempre es tener la propiedad alquilada entonces hay que buscar el precio razonable para cada propiedad
7124310 las grandes empresas no tienen problemas en pagar lo que sea
7124311 tienen un margen de ganancia muy alto que les permite afrontar mayores costos
7124312 est n acostumbrados a pagar cifras alt simas como 50 mil por el alquiler de un local entonces cuando encuentran uno en la peatonal santafesina por 20 mil les parece un buen negocio el tema es que no conocen el mercado interno y cu l es el movimiento
7124313 a los comerciantes locales les cuesta mucho afrontar los aumentos pero a los propietarios no les importa porque saben que hay una alta demanda de marcas de afuera sin embargo lo que no tienen en cuenta es la cuesti n social que hay detr s de un local santafesino en primer lugar porque la plata queda en la ciudad no se va afuera y adem s porque la gente contratada es de ac no vienen empleados de otras ciudades como pas con las grandes empresas
7124314 nosotros los agentes inmobiliarios no somos generadores de precios sino que son los propietarios los que deciden uno puede asesorarlos pero a veces son caprichosos y hasta que no se encuentran con que no alquilan su local por varios meses no deciden bajar los precios
7124315 antes del conflicto del campo el promedio de espera para alquilar un local sobre calle san mart n era de unos 60 d as mientras que hoy ese tiempo se ha extendido mucho m s el propietario empieza a pensar en conservar el inquilino cuando ve que el mercado se va parando que hay desocupaci n de locales y que pasan meses sin alquilarse
7124316 i have to agree somewhat my feeling is that in tough economic times when some papers though mercifully not so much at the post are closing down whole bureaus and covering foreign news less we should send everyone out with laptops to find actual news rather than to hang out at a canned event
7124317 joe wont just make a good vice president he will make a great one
7124318 now with joe biden at my side i am confident that we can take this country in a new direction that we are ready to overcome the adversity of the last eight years that we wont just win this election in november well restore that fair shot at your dreams that is at the core of who joe biden and i are as people and what america is as a nation
7124319 folks barack and i come from very different places but we share a common story an american story
7124320 this is no ordinary election and this may be our last chance to reclaim the america we love to restore americas soul

7124323 ik heb de hele nacht bijna geen oog dicht gedaan de hemel weet wat er in mijn bed lag ik heb op iets hards gelegen en ik ben over mijn hele lichaam bont en blauw het is afschuwelijk
7124324 i would have thought it has done it no harm
7124325 the idea is that we do want michael to stay all of us we have just got to get to the point where we have got an agreement and thats got to be right for both parties
7124326 i know he wants to stay i know he likes it here really likes it here and i have made it absolutely clear i want him to
7124327 it will run its course i think we are pretty close but we will find out on wednesday and we will see
7124328 i dont think he has done his case any harm do you
7124329 i doubted about my future at barca but then i had a chat with guardiola and he told me he counts a lot on me believes in my quality and he also told me i could help the team a lot this season
7124330 i dont want to stay for the sake of it but to play i wouldnt have stayed if they didnt rely on me
7124331 i came here to win titles and this season we have to do our best to do it
7124332 how to measure website success when rankings google pagerank and sheer traffic have gone the way of hits all these older metrics become more and more meaningless in the current web environment
7124333 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7124334 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7124335 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7124336 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7124337 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7124338 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7124339 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7124340 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7124341 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7124342 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7124343 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7124344 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7124345 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7124346 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7124347 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7124348 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7124349 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7124350 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7124351 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7124352 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7124353 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7124354 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7124355 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7124356 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7124357 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7124358 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7124359 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7124360 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7124361 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7124362 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7124363 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7124364 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7124365 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7124366 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7124367 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7124368 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7124369 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7124370 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7124371 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7124372 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7124373 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7124374 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7124375 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7124376 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7124377 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7124378 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7124379 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7124380 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7124381 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7124382 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7124383 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7124384 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7124385 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7124386 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7124387 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7124388 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7124389 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7124390 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7124391 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7124392 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7124393 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7124394 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7124395 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7124396 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7124397 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7124398 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7124399 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7124400 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7124401 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7124402 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7124403 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7124404 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7124405 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7124406 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7124407 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7124408 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7124409 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7124410 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7124411 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7124412 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7124413 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7124414 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7124415 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7124416 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7124417 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7124418 this is a planning took where all things are going
7124419 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7124420 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7124421 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7124422 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

7124441 i doubted about my future at barca but then i had a chat with guardiola and he told me he counts a lot on me believes in my quality and he also told me i could help the team a lot this season
7124442 i dont want to stay for the sake of it but to play i wouldnt have stayed if they didnt rely on me
7124443 i came here to win titles and this season we have to do our best to do it
7124444 overall im happy id have liked a second goal i thought our play deserved a second goal because at 1 0 their real threat came from corners and free kicks but the goalkeeper was excellent at handling crosses and the defenders were very brave and to keep a clean sheet youre always in with a chance of winning
7124445 if wed scored a second goal early enough we could have gone on to score one or two more there can be no doubt that we did enough to win the game
7124446 he was outstanding today hes designed for getting the ball down and making it happen
7124447 getting into a battle would suit hamilton so we were the team that got the ball down and passed and we wanted to get the ball to taouil so that he could get the ball early and cause the hamilton defence problems
7124448 he causes problems because he is so clever and strong with the ball at his feet and if we got the movement right which we did today we were always a threat against them but to be fair they stuck to their task and didnt make it easy but we were little bit better than them today
7124449 one of our problems last year was we lacked a bit of edge dig and steel in the middle of the park and we have that now he has great composure on the ball and when there is a ball to be won he invariably wins it great asset is he is very good in the air and of course is a help at set plays for and against
7124450 i felt our second half performance was a good one we created plenty of openings and should have scored two or three more
7124451 first half i felt we were a little too deep but there was a big difference in the second half
7124452 i would be worried if we were playing and werent creating but we are and hopefully that will continue
7124453 we limited inverness to chances only in the second half they were dangerous due to their power and height but overall i was pleased with the way we played
7124454 i had heard about our record of never having scored in inverness but im not interested in it we scored a great goal and should have had more no doubt about that
7124455 at the moment hes scoring and he gets those chances because of his willingness to get himself into good positions
7124456 i would have thought it has done it no harm
7124457 the idea is that we do want michael to stay all of us we have just got to get to the point where we have got an agreement and thats got to be right for both parties
7124458 i know he wants to stay i know he likes it here really likes it here and i have made it absolutely clear i want him to
7124459 it will run its course i think we are pretty close but we will find out on wednesday and we will see
7124460 i dont think he has done his case any harm do you

7124581 there are certain traditions in politics that are hard to disturb
7124582 this year superdelegates comprised 20 percent of our national delegation yet the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelegates were until this year
7124583 the role they played in our nominating process actually distracted us from the important issues we were debating
7124584 no matter how much power government has it never has enough
7124585 the most difficult thing about politics is dealing with people with really bad breath
7124586 once you create a bureaucracy it is near to impossible to ever get rid of it
7124587 if not 180 degrees from that about 178 1 2
7124588 i think its fair to say that bob has never been afraid to embrace controversial issues or positions and always had a knack for turning his actions into ink
7124589 the curse is that people view him as being this bombastic character who really is more thoughtful and has a greater degree of moderation
7124590 change the nature of the debate and raise the issue in the publics eye
7124591 it could enhance the things he enjoys doing speaking pontificating writing
7124592 whatever step would be required for bob barr as president to cut back by 10 percent the executive office of the president would be done
7124593 what is the position about the poor and helping the poor
7124594 if we have no government or little government whos going to administrate over these different programs lets say food stamps what is the view on things like that
7124595 youre not gonna feel guilty the morning after election night
7124596 theres never an excuse to not be pleasant and civil
7124597 the people that hate jesus put him on the cross
7124598 okay why am i looking at a bunch of random people with this weird ass girl
7124599 i would argue that if you are making more than 250 000 then you are in the top 3 4 percent of this country
7124600 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
7124601 to be fair to both of them rich is an adjective
7124602 economic science is not going to tell you that this is the cutoff point
7124603 if you set the bar at half a million youre talking about the top 1 percent of taxpayers if you think about the last eight years those are the folks who have benefited the most
7124604 give me a specific number is it 100 000 dollars is it 50 200
7124605 if you do surveys 95 percent of people think they are middle class
7124606 this is including people who are objectively quite poor and people who are objectively quite rich
7124607 i guess it says something nice about america that rich people dont want to act like theyre better than anybody else and poor people dont like complaining about how tough it is to pay their bills
7124608 it should come as no surprise that john mccain believes the cutoff for the rich begins at 5 million
7124609 it may explain why his tax plan gives a 600 000 tax cut to the richest 0 1 percent of earners
7124610 some of the richest people ive known in my life are the most unhappy
7124611 by a home a good job and education and the ability to hand our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one we inherited
7124612 the man with the best job in the country is the vice president
7124613 believe me you must trust me dont you doubt or look behind i sincerely love you and ill give you peace of mind
7124614 there are things that you must go through without a shadow of a doubt but rest assured ill be right there and i will bring you out
7124615 i am always here to comfort as you struggle in your life remember you have adversaries who will take you through some strife
7124616 just remember ill be back one day to claim you as my own be vigilant you watch and pray dont let your heart turn into stone

7124627 i know he wants to stay i know he likes it here really likes it here and i have made it absolutely clear i want him to
7124628 it will run its course i think we are pretty close but we will find out on wednesday and we will see

7124664 well maybe theyve gotten tired of being the underdog this could be their move to take control after all whoever owns the moon has considerable power over alien interactions as well as over earth itself all theyd have to do was get control of the defensive weaponry and turn it on earth and they could bring the planet to its knees

7124720 we support leading jammu based journalist balraj puris formula for autonomy of regions within j amp k for which he has been campaigning for the last sixty years
7124721 the formula is a solution to the root cause of regional tension the present over centralized system of governance in as diverse a state as jammu and kashmir
7124722 puris report as the head of the regional autonomy committee 1999 elaborates on the constitutional political and economic aspects of this formula
7124723 it got approval of pandit nehru and sheikh abdullah even the jana sangh founder president shyama prasad mukherjee endorsed the idea in his letter to pandit nehru in which he offered to support delhi agreement guaranteeing autonomy to the state of j amp k provided regional autonomy was granted to jammu ladakh and kashmir
7124724 its repercussions are tending to extend to the rest of the country
7124725 it merely provided a flashpoint to the alienation of the people of kashmir which continues to exist and the accumulated discontent among the people of jammu mainly over the perceived lack of share in political power

7124820 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him

7124844 i havent even thought about that i havent talked about that its not in my thinking right now dont know if itll come to that right now im just thinking of this new role and what i have to do and continue to just come to work

7124848 really thats what it comes down to their job is to evaluate talent in this league and make decisions who are the best players for their teams and i dont agree with it for one reason or another it ends at that

7124851 what they told me was that it was going to be a competition and thats the way i approached it
7124852 im going to prepare to play as well as i can and if thats not good enough thats not good enough
7124853 obviously if you dont play well enough you dont deserve to be on the field
7124854 it was nothing really unexpected but its nice now that our roles are defined and we can move on and help the team within those roles

7124859 republicans continue to drive up america record national debt with tax breaks for their big oil cronies while denying a pay raise for 15 million americans
7124860 the fact is that revenues are way below what the administration said they would be a few years ago
7124861 the long term prognosis is still very very bleak and the administration doesnt have any kind of long term plan
7124862 the tax relief we delivered has helped unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of america and kept our economy the envy of the world

7124871 sometimes i feel it more than others i guess these things happen i play a lot of games and given the way i play physically i demand a lot of myself
7124872 i wish it wasnt the case but i just have to cope with it
7124873 they have sorted me out a training programme and seem to have got it under control
7124874 i do a bit more every day hopefully i will be back playing in a week or two and will then be fit for the rest of the season
7124875 last season i was fit towards the end that is the reason the boss brought me here

7125111 we see the adoption of the fla by kde as a positive and important milestone in the maturity of the free software community
7125112 the fla was designed to help projects increase the legal maintainability of their software to ensure long term protection and reliability kde is among the most important free software initiatives and it is playing a central role in bringing freedom to the desktop this decision of the kde project underlines its dedication to think about how to make that freedom last
7125113 kde e v has endorsed the use of a particular fla based directly on the fsfes sample fla as the preferred way to assign copyright to the association we recognise that assignment is an option that individuals may wish to exercise it is in no way pushed upon kde contributors there are also other avenues of copyright assignment available besides the fla but we believe this is the easiest way to get it done with little fuss enthusiasm for the fla was immediate people were asking for printed versions of the form before the week was out so that they could fill one in
7125114 the fla is a versatile document designed to work across different countries with different perceptions of copyright and authorship
7125115 as a truly international project kde provides a great example of how the fla can provide legal coherency in the mid to long term its been a pleasure to help with the adoption process and fsfes freedom task force is ready to continuing supporting kde in the future
7125116 the choice to exact consideration in the form of compliance with the open source requirements is entitled to no less legal recognition

7125136 o profissional que est se formando com certeza deve se interessar por uma remunera o compat vel com o que praticado no mercado entretanto esse n o deve ser o fator decisivo de sua escolha especialmente se a carreira na qual est ingressando possui um potencial de remunera o elevado a longo prazo
7125137 no in cio da carreira a preocupa o deve ser com o aprendizado com a transforma o do conhecimento em sabedoria na faculdade aprende se muito mas n o d para aplicar o aprendizado
7125138 vejo muitos jovens estabelecerem uma rela o entre seus sal rios e o padr o de vida que t m em casa eles chegam conclus o de que necessitam ganhar 20 vezes mais do que ganham hoje e entram em p nico o certo sentar com o pai ou a m e e perguntar como foi seu in cio de carreira certamente ele ou ela dir que ganhava pouco e que teve que ralar muito para chegar aonde chegou
7125139 por mais que voc estude no mercado de trabalho n o existe um substituto para a experi ncia preciso vivenciar
7125140 os jovens est o muito apressados mas o que d satisfa o a conquista poder dizer eu consegui porque batalhei
7125141 v lido observar alguns aspectos pensando no futuro de sua carreira
7125142 o sal rio n o constitu do s do dinheiro mas tamb m dos benef cios tais como plano de sa de que pode fazer toda a diferen a para quem j casado e tem filhos ajuda de custo para realiza o de cursos e plano de previd ncia privada o profissional deve analisar a remunera o total

7125145 converse com profissionais daquele ramo espec fico e tente entender o dia a dia dele longe do glamour algumas profiss es s o bem dif ceis
7125146 o profissional no in cio de sua carreira est ainda em uma curva de aprendizado muito grande na qual absorve mais informa es do que gera para a empresa a partir do momento em que o profissional deixa de ser um potencial e torna se efetivamente uma realidade em termos de entrega de resultados a remunera o passa a ser motivo de preocupa o e o profissional deve almejar um reconhecimento financeiro
7125147 fazendo tudo isso cedo ou tarde ele deve ter retorno financeiro
7125148 se as respostas para essas perguntas mostrarem um crescimento profissional por m um reconhecimento negativo no que se refere remunera o talvez seja o momento para uma mudan a j que o profissional simplesmente n o est sendo reconhecido financeiramente embora entregue ou supere as expectativas de seus gestores entretanto necess rio ficar atento pois muitas vezes entregar o que descrito em seu job description n o o que as empresas esperam geralmente os profissionais que trazem o algo mais s o aqueles que ir o sair do lugar comum e s o promovidos

7125150 o que quero que aconte a dentro de um determinado per odo

7125191 i write everything by hand paragraph by paragraph and then at the end of the day i type up what ive written usually 1 000 words on a typewriter when the book is done ill do handwritten corrections then retype it all on the typewriter i wrote a screenplay on a computer once and hated it so much that i vowed i would never do it again i got carpal tunnel and wound up having to wear a brace

7125223 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7125224 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters

7125230 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7125231 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7125232 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7125233 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7125234 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7125235 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7125236 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7125237 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7125238 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7125239 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7125240 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7125241 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7125242 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7125243 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7125244 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7125245 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7125246 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7125247 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7125248 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7125249 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7125250 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7125251 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7125252 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7125253 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7125254 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7125255 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7125256 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7125257 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7125258 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7125259 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7125260 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7125261 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7125262 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
7125263 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7125264 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7125265 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7125266 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7125267 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7125268 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7125269 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7125270 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7125271 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7125272 this is about shifting the power back to the people
7125273 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7125274 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7125275 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7125276 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7125277 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7125278 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7125279 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7125280 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7125281 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
7125282 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
7125283 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
7125284 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7125285 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7125286 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7125287 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7125288 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7125289 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7125290 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7125291 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7125292 if we use their tactics well lose the moral high ground
7125293 the fundamental basis of this nations laws was given to moses on the mount the fundamental basis of our bill of rights comes from the teachings we get from exodus and st matthew from isaiah and st paul
7125294 i dont think we emphasize that enough these days if we dont have a proper fundamental moral background we will finally end up with a totalitarian government which does not believe in rights for anybody except the state
7125295 a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor
7125296 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7125297 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7125298 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7125299 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7125300 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7125301 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7125302 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7125303 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7125304 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7125305 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7125306 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7125307 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7125308 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7125309 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7125310 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7125311 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7125312 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7125313 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7125314 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7125315 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7125316 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7125317 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7125318 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7125319 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7125320 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7125321 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7125322 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7125323 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7125324 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7125325 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7125326 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7125327 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7125328 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7125329 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7125330 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7125331 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7125332 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7125333 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7125334 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7125335 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7125336 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7125337 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7125338 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7125339 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7125340 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7125341 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7125342 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7125343 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7125344 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7125345 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7125346 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7125347 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7125348 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7125349 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7125350 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7125351 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7125352 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7125353 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7125354 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7125355 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7125356 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7125357 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7125358 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7125359 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7125360 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
7125361 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
7125362 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
7125363 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
7125364 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
7125365 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7125366 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7125367 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7125368 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7125369 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7125370 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7125371 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7125372 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7125373 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7125374 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7125375 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7125376 she was moving around like a dog will when its fighting
7125377 most places in alaska dont have a persistent problem with bear or moose because if its anywhere near the village they shoot it no questions asked
7125378 its the last frontier mentality you dont tolerate any risk from wild animals
7125379 the joke used to be anchorage isnt too bad because its only two hours from alaska
7125380 the truth is alaska is right here weve got bears we got moose we got wolves you name it
7125381 if you dont get enough to eat you get cranky
7125382 she was on the ground sitting up bloody her cellphone out
7125383 she heard growling and all of a sudden it was on her
7125384 the idea of bears is so predominant and so much bigger than the animals themselves
7125385 ive been all over the backwoods here and never seen it like this the prevalence this summer is just staggering
7125386 im not blaming anybody else the bear was the bear and did what bears do
7125387 i dont see it any different than new york in rush hour you just have to pay attention our cars just have hair and teeth
7125388 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7125389 each microchip has a scannable bar code that tells who owns it
7125390 the odds are that we wont microchip every plant but it will have a deterrent effect
7125391 the city decided to stop apologizing for the desert and said we live in the desert it is what it is
7125392 they have a very shallow root system and can be popped out pretty easily
7125393 in some cases the thieves work for landscapers and in other cases they are independent contractors who sell the saguaro to legitimate commercial operations
7125394 depending on the size and shape or if it has arms they sell for anywhere from 500 to 5 000 or more each
7125395 we dont have a problem with thefts anymore maybe because we have armed rangers patrolling everywhere
7125396 these are probably worth 150 or 200 each i think the economy is driving a lot of this if it isnt nailed down they are going to take it
7125397 we are trying to be in the forefront of water wise planting and are cutting down on our lush vegetation a lot of people are getting away from lawns and turf in favor of desert landscaping a golden barrel 3 or 4 feet across is worth 4 500 or more you pay by the inch
7125398 there has always been plant theft but now it has escalated
7125399 it has increased because a landscaper has a job to do and with the slowdown in the economy he may look for cheaper prices i have heard that some of these thieves sell plants on street corners now
7125400 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7125401 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7125402 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7125403 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7125404 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7125405 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7125406 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
7125407 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7125408 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7125409 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7125410 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7125411 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7125412 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7125413 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7125414 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7125415 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7125416 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7125417 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7125418 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7125419 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7125420 dont hate me because im beautiful hate me because im beautiful smart and rich
7125421 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7125422 shes unique shes afflicted with crippling depression the elephant sanctuary is the right choice
7125423 why would we want her last years to be in a drive through zoo in mexico when she could have 300 acres in the lush tennessee countryside
7125424 if we stripped everything away and say what is in the best interest of jenny the sanctuary would win hands down
7125425 but then you have to add in all the politics
7125426 i like keeping these elephants within the aza where they meet our standards
7125427 space is just a catchphrase its what you do with that space
7125428 the rights of birds are outweighing the rights of humans
7125429 i tried to plant a garden but i didnt get far because of the smell im just tired of the whole thing
7125430 we had some success but a judge said if we did it one more time hed have everyone arrested
7125431 i just dont know how to communicate that to the birds
7125432 were not going to use public health as an excuse to override legal protections and do something detrimental to this bird population
7125433 everybody sees a real need for us to reform the way we do this
7125434 its such an emotional issue in those states that its very unlikely thats going to change
7125435 there are certain traditions in politics that are hard to disturb
7125436 this year superdelegates comprised 20 percent of our national delegation yet the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelegates were until this year
7125437 the role they played in our nominating process actually distracted us from the important issues we were debating
7125438 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7125439 konfronterad med fynden f rklarade maken sedan 22 r att han anv nt kondomen sedan han tappat mobiltelefonen i toaletten och inte hittat n gra gummihandskar p fr gan om vems trosorna var svarade den rodnande mannen att han var transvestit
7125440 its important that we reach out to windows it staff cios or trainers who are not familiar with the area of integrating macs in enterprise
7125441 we also aim to enable the mac users to have the mac experience without compromise
7125442 the iphone is coming and people think this is going to create increased interest in macs
7125443 a equipe recuou muito no segundo tempo mas em virtude do time advers rio que colocou mais atacantes mas que isso sirva de li o para quando tivermos uma vantagem dessa a gente n o recue tanto seria muito ruim abrir dois a zero e sofrer o empate
7125444 quando o time n o fica bom a substitui o sempre equivocada tem um monte de entendido que sempre v o futebol pelo mesmo ngulo se recuou porque eu coloquei o time para tr s ningu m v os m ritos do advers rio que nos empurrou para tr s a menos que douglas e morais sejam defensivos porque se fossem eu teria culpa por colocar o time mais para tr s
7125445 o que acontece normalmente quando o advers rio est perdendo que ele come a a se expor mais jogando com dois ou tr s atacantes com isso temos que marcar mais forte o advers rio para que termine esse mpeto mas infelizmente n o conseguimos fazer isso e o jogo tornou se emocionante no final
7125446 fall into summer the seasonally psychedelic stylings of beach house
7125447 you need an nt domain on a pdc for everything to work ok
7125448 domain member digitally encrypt or sign secure channel data always
7125449 the acls for folders in mac os x server share points are compatible with windows xp acl settings a windows xp user can use windows explorer to set the acl permissions of shared folders and the changes will affect windows mac os x and unix clients that access the folders
7125450 if yes allows users on windows nt 2000 xp clients to modify acl settings
7125451 we had to make a change on the vista client under the ntlm security settings to allow authentication after this we were able to mount the shares on our mac os x server
7125452 strange though as the afflicted computer will work after you do the steps but if restarted will not authenticate until the steps are performed again
7125453 basically the issue with samba and vista is that vista no longer permits lm or ntlm authentication by default only ntlmv2 samba versions 1 x and 2 x only support lm and ntlm so theres an issue there

7125565 youve got to expect it even though i would have liked to have done better
7125566 a couple of things didnt quite go my way and that happens when youre not quite on top of your game
7125567 you get slightly out with your clubbing and there were a couple of bad three putts
7125568 but at the end of the day i would definitely put it down to mental tardiness rather than anything else
7125569 you never like missing cuts you dont want to do that
7125570 but it is really a knock on from the last couple of weeks and i think id rather take two wins and a missed cut
7125571 theres no doubt that a couple of days rest will do me more good than playing a couple more rounds here at the back of the field thats for sure
7125572 and its a long week next week so im sort of happy to have the break
7125573 hopefully ill come out stronger next week there was always going to be a little bit of a falloff when you do things like that but i struggled and so i was a little bit disappointed in the end
7125574 i came here to try to show nick i have a bit of game and if i play well i have a great chance
7125575 this week has been good in that i have hit a lot of good shots and made a lot of chances
7125576 i had lots of chances and hit a lot of really good shots and a couple of poor ones probably due to a lack of concentration
7125577 im playing with one of the great players in the world in henrik again tomorrow so it should be great i knew i was playing ok and ive really enjoyed the course
7125578 that was pathetic just pathetic a load of old rubbish
7125579 i need to play well this week and next week and so far this week ive done that
7125580 if nick then feels i am worthy of a pick so be it if not then thats acceptable

7125656 its just a confirmation that sen obama does not have the track record that minnesotans and americans are looking for
7125657 there certainly is a grieving process and a lot of what ifs
7125658 it is essential to note that we may fail persistently in the nigerian project if our education stops where moral rectitude and creative questioning begin i believe strongly that if we re invent our education sector we would be able to reduce the army of beggars on our street create wealth and reduce the burden of the extended family we all are daily confronted with
7125659 bugged down by substandard infrastructure this is the only oil rich nation with the highest number of bad roads clogged drainages uncoordinated physical planning and the most deadly environmental conditions
7125660 our nation has been described as a country in perpetual darkness because of regular power failure the resultant impact of this on industrial development is horrendous our hospitals and health centres are in bad shape they were once described by a former presidential aspirant john nwodo as a veritable harbinger for the multiplication of bacteria our educational sector is under serious threat of under funding and absence of adequate facilities
7125661 every nigerian should play his or her role conscientiously and most of all students must remain vibrant and articulate in ensuring that they contribute meaningfully towards building a new nigeria our focus today however is not on the roles of the first five segments comprising government organisations and individuals it is predominantly on the role of students
7125662 teachers would benefit from the new salary structure in the zone since they are public servants
7125663 the forum is working towards the harmonisation of the remuneration paid to office holders and civil servants in the zone to ensure uniformity of pay structures in the zone and has commenced full review of the current salary structures in all states of the zone
7125664 the review is going to be extensively holistic in all areas and the teachers will not be left out in the new arrangement because they are also public servants
7125665 the objectives of training include to motivate strengthen and develop the entrepreneurial skills competencies and abilities of participants to stimulate among participants the ability to identify and exploit economic opportunities that abound all around them thereby transforming business ideas into productive enterprises to create confidence through exposure to current business challenges and how to overcome them enabling participants to plan systematically and thus increase their chances of success and to enhance timely repayments of loans while developing discipline and positive attitude by the beneficiaries
7125666 the loan was without the approval of the state governor but since the admission of the loan procurement without due process and deposited in a private account the state government has not reacted on whether he would be withdrawn or not
7125667 the state government is not liable for the repayment of the n150million loan
7125668 the process can be achieved by obtaining synthetic gas which could be further refined to get gas co and hydrogen which constitute base for synthetic metan diesel fuel ethanol propylene etc
7125669 we therefore place a high premium on training our staff as well as on the quality of services we offer our customers
7125670 i walk out and i thought well no one saw that except my mom who tuned in to c span
7125671 my phone rings my cell phone its at night and its joe biden like three minutes after i finished the speech and hes saying that was a great speech good work hes just someone who is a very positive guy
7125672 minnesota will love joe biden when they get to know him i can just see him up on the iron range right now he has blue collar roots hes a very warm person
7125673 barack obama wanted to pick someone as hes always said that wasnt a yes man he wanted to pick someone who would challenge him to be a better president and joe biden will do that
7125674 it had just broke we had no idea what bridge it was and i was going to leave to go see what it was and he said you better go home now
7125675 hes just always sort of looking out for people and thinking about other people and you can see that in how hes gotten along with people so well in the senate
7125676 sen obama has once again shown his outstanding judgment in selecting sen joe biden as his vice presidential nominee
7125677 they share the same vision for america and together they will turn the economy around ease the burden on families and finally end the war in iraq
7125678 if sites were shops egullet would be selfridges a massive department store trying to cater to all tastes sometimes though i want a boutique operation top of these is dos hermanos the blog of the two half bengali half welsh majumdar brothers who eat out more than is strictly necessary and write very well about it

7125693 true communication is possible only between equals because inferiors are more consistently rewarded for telling their superiors pleasant lies than for telling the truth a central tenet of discordianism often invoked by hackers to explain why authoritarian hierarchies screw up so reliably and systematically the effect of the s n a f u principle is a progressive disconnection of decision makers from reality
7125694 the fundamental cause of trouble in the world today is that the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt
7125695 those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities
7125696 the important thing in writing is the capacity to astonish not shock shock is a worn out word but astonish
7125697 im for clean energy i just dont ever vote for it
7125698 i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7125699 a man with a distinguished record a man with fundamental decency and that man is joe biden
7125700 obama chose to go with experience someone who could help him overall to complement what he lacks which is long time experience in foreign policy in washington and in the legislative process for example
7125701 domestically biden fills some gaps too one of them being support among working class catholic voters in very important states like pennsylvania and ohio thats where hillary clinton trounced obama in these depressed steel mining or manufacturing cities
7125702 biden has these working class roots a catholic base and a strong family image so obamas hope is that he will go to these people and say
7125703 obama is an ok guy hes acceptable to me and so he should be acceptable to you
7125704 but you have to question how much a running mate really matters in the election
7125705 there have been very strong running mates for failed candidates in the past
7125706 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7125707 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgement and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realising that barack obama is not ready to be president
7125708 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
7125709 there is a lot of electricity there even though everybody will dice it up and think about which constituencies are going to be more likely to vote for the ticket now at the end of the day it is about the chemistry between these two folks
7125710 when you add biden to it you add a populism to the ticket that may not have existed before in addition to all the credibility that comes with his experience
7125711 in your condition you should lose at least 10 pounds or youre in for major problems

7125756 it gives all of the voters in the mayo electorate a chance to get an idea of whether its something that we actually believe in or if were just talking from a scriptwriters view
7125757 for the smaller parties and the independents its very difficult for us to compete with the huge budget that the liberal party has
7125758 the liberals have been able to send out about three or four letters so far to most of the voters in the mayo electorate none of us smaller people can compete with that at all
7125759 for a lot of people this will be the only time theyll get to see us candidates and when you consider that one of us will be going to canberra i think the electors actually have a right to see us and hear us and get an idea who we are and what were about

7125799 obama did not dedicate dreams from my father to his mother or to his father barack senior or to his indonesian stepfather
7125800 it is to my family though my mother my grandparents my siblings stretched across oceans and continents that i owe the deepest gratitude and to whom i dedicated this book without their constant love and support without their willingness to let me sing their song and their toleration of the occasional wrong note i could never have hoped to finish if nothing else i hope that the love and respect i feel for them shines through on every page
7125801 obama failed to discuss his fathers alcoholism and polygamy in his autobiography
7125802 obamas story of his fathers life is dense presented in anything but a straightforward manner often glorified or embellished so as to mask much of the harsh and for obama probably painful truth
7125803 now as i sat in the glow of a single light bulb rocking slightly on a hard backed chair that image had suddenly vanished replaced by what a bitter drunk an abusive husband a defeated lonely bureaucrat to think that all my life i had been wrestling with nothing more than a ghost

7125877 the band wrote religion is a whore as a response to the cartoon crisis which was triggered by a danish cartoonist who made a drawing of muhammed with a bomb in his turban to western people this is nothing more than comedy response to the fact that certain extremists think its the ultimate servitude to blow up innocent people the peoples of the muslim world attacked danish embassies and burned the danish flag in protests around the world the band suggests in this song that religion is to blame and the that religion has no place in politics whatsoever but it doesnt stop there 9 11 is also discussed as there is evidence that we are not being told the whole truth about that event

7125887 the architects concept for the building plan allowed the curve of jenai circle to inflect the shape of the building so we were working with an interesting curve almost like the shape of a sail in the wind
7125888 the second part of the lighting concept called for the introduction of a digital ticker sign like those in times square this idea evolved into a low resolution information fa ade with the overall impression of a building standing in the wind in the center of taipei
7125889 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7125890 he never complained about what he had he just took it and tried to make the product better
7125891 we knew we should listen because he had been doing it as a bench coach for five years in anaheim and had a great manager to learn from in mike scioscia hed been to the world series
7125892 we had such a bad second half and hes managing his butt off

7125897 as an educated professional woman still working 60 hours a week at age 70 and a democrat for 25 years i feel disenfranchised and insulted by obamas ignoring and snubbing senator clinton the issues on the table are healthcare and the economy and then national security i have lost total faith in a man who i believed would be a bright shining star he is after all a politician and one who must be intimidated by the senator from new york hes lost my vote
7125898 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
7125899 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
7125900 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
7125901 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
7125902 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
7125903 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
7125904 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
7125905 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
7125906 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
7125907 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy
7125908 this is the true joy in life being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one being a force of nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy i am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and as long as i live it is my privilege to do for it whatever i can i want to be thoroughly used up when i die for the harder i work the more i live i rejoice in life for its own sake life is no brief candle to me its a sort of splendid torch which ive got to hold up for the moment and i want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing on to future generations
7125909 whats wrong do you not love us the visitors before gave us gifts
7125910 there are pockets of hell in our inner cities and that even as an entire sector of america is condemned to burn in them we insist on looking the other way
7125911 its not like well these babies just arent dying fast enough
7125912 if you weave enough bad things into the fibers of a persons life sickness and filth old mattresses and other junk thrown in the streets and other ugly ruined things and ruined people a prison here a sewage there drug dealers here the homeless people over there then give us the very worst schools anyone could think of hospitals that keep you waiting for ten hours police that dont show up when someones dying take the train thats underneath the street in the good neighborhoods and put it up above where it shuts out the sun you can guess that life will not be very nice and children will not have much sense of being glad of who they are sometimes it feels like weve been buried six feet under their perceptions
7125913 just one block up and two avenues over on the corner of 138 th and alexander youll see it
7125914 can you give us any more information on the safety there you know what precautions they should take will they be targeted because they are four white girls living in a predominantly black and puerto rican neighborhood
7125915 well its a really rough block me telling you that is a lot take every precaution you can dont be stupid and use common sense be careful
7125916 listen all i can tell you if you want the honest truth is that its one of the worst streets in our precinct our precinct stretches from insert here and beekman ave is one of the worst blocks it isnt suburbia
7125917 maybe i heard there was a homicide or stabbing or something there a few days ago thats all i know
7125918 yep thats the bad corner ive been here for eighteen years and that side of beekman has given us a lot of trouble the area is picking up though things were definitely a lot worse when i first started here in the past twenty years weve been doing a lot of work to clean up the area and most of the gang leaders who control the drug trade have been arrested but there are still problems right now we have someone there around the clock because of the shooting a few days ago
7125919 honestly i would tell my friends to stay away from there im not going to tell you not to move there but i will tell you that its a dangerous block which side are you on
7125920 well i understand if you decide to but i cant tell you to
7125921 being brave does not mean you go out looking for trouble
7125922 well i have some of my sisters clothes that shes outgrown maybe they would fit your daughter
7125923 people in china might not know president george w bush
7125924 boom the unbeatable were beaten the great wall of table tennis was finally broken
7125925 what lisa means to this team both this year and usa basketball in general i think the gold medals kind of speak for themselves
7125926 i dont know many teams that could have their starting two and three guard go out with foul trouble and still go up 20 points in the first half
7125927 its been an honor for me to represent my country and obviously now in my fourth olympics to have four gold medals shows a level of dominance that ive been able to participate in with so many great players
7125928 i think that speaks volumes for lisa and her legacy here
7125929 i would be shameful to try to take all the credit
7125930 its been handed off and i dont have a choice to take it and run with it
7125931 we dont have a choice but to get things done
7125932 they are as you can see more than ready to take the torch and run with it
7125933 it provides propaganda to the taliban and if they dont take responsibility it actually helps the taliban
7125934 coalition forces are aware of allegations that the engagement in the shindand district of herat province friday may have resulted in civilian casualties
7125935 all allegations of civilian casualties are taken very seriously coalition forces make every effort to prevent the injury or loss of innocent lives an investigation has been directed
7125936 there is no evidence to show there were taliban there that night
7125937 i just got this good idea i should use it to promote my country and my flag
7125938 im not saying i have a good voice but it looks like it would be fun
7125939 he said in the future maybe we should design shoes like james bond
7125940 one time its a throwing shoe the next time you push a button and spikes come out the bottom for the run
7125941 they scream they sing they fall down they take their clothes off they cross dress they vomit
7125942 it is only the british people not the germans or the french
7125943 many arrests are due to behavior caused by excessive drinking
7125944 i think that in their country they are like prisoners and they want to feel free
7125945 its because of british culture no one can relax so they become inebriated to be the people they want to be
7125946 when things do go wrong they go wrong in quite a big way
7125947 what were trying to do here is reduce some of these avoidable accidents where they have so much to drink that they fall off balconies and are either killed or need huge operations

7125966 ik ga een heel andere kant van mezelf laten zien ik lach wel maar ondertussen heb ik je portefeuille al gerold ik schater in je gezicht terwijl ik onderwijl bedenk hoe ik je s nacht ga beroven ik ben de ergste gluiperd die er bestaat het wordt moeilijk ik heb eigenlijk een heel andere inborst paul de leeuw heeft de rol in 1991 gespeeld simone kleinsma was zijn vrouw ik hoop dat ik ook iemand krijg met wie ik klik
7125967 ik ga chantal janzen missen met haar heb ik toen we in scheveningen beauty and the beast speelden vaak in n bed geslapen in het kurhaus dat kunnen toch weinig mensen zeggen zo heel kameraadschappelijk samen knus arm in arm naar een horrorfilm kijken en dan slapen of dan sprong ik om haar te laten schrikken opeens uit de badkamer wij zijn echt vrienden geworden maar chantal zit in tarzan en mijn tegenspeelster in les mis rables zal ook wel rondborstiger worden zo doen ze het bij les mis vaak als de herbergier slank is wordt de herbergierster volslank of omgekeerd flinke paul kreeg dus slanke simone

7125969 het is te ingewikkeld om in drie woorden uit te leggen maar het is een epos dat zijn weerga niet kent ik vergelijk het met starwars of in de ban van de ring dat boek van tolkien heeft me geholpen bij de auditie ik leefde me in in gollum de gluiperd die de magische ring jaren verbergt
7125970 in les mis rables speel je ook niet je leeft erin je bent met zn allen onderdeel van iets fenomenaals een kunstwerk van emoties en diepgang
7125971 ik ben zo vereerd dat ik ben uitgekozen ik ben niet eens zanger en alle tekst is gezongen en toch heeft cameron me uitgekozen uit de groep die in de auditie was overgebleven hij weet niets van mijn carri re heeft mijn cv niet eens gezien het is een wonder
7125972 marianne van wijnkoop belde me op of ik auditie wilde doen haar hebben irene en ik heel vaak gepersifleerd dus ik dacht eerst nog dat irene een geintje met me uithaalde maar het was bloedserieus ik kwam steeds verder oefende met goede vriend ger otten die de klok speelde in beauty de zangpartijen en lag tijdens de audities duivels op de grond tegen god te praten waar ik het vandaan heb kunnen halen ik ben nog steeds helemaal verbouwereerd dat ik het ben geworden ik ben de rtl bazen fons van westerloo en bart in t hout ook heel dankbaar zij zorgen in de zes maanden dat ik les mis rables moet spelen dat ik geen andere tv verplichtingen dan life amp cooking heb top toch
7125973 toen ik auditie deed voor de film ciske de rat moest ik een vieze mop vertellen daarom stelde ik voor de kinderen die nu auditie doen voor de musical ook zon mop te laten vertellen je ziet dan goed hoe vrij ze zijn maar al die kinderen hadden een opleiding en vertelden keurige moppen op n na gelukkig

7125976 het was erop of eronder want ik was al te groot voor het servet maar nog te klein voor het tafellaken
7125977 een probleem was het dramatische afscheidslied nou tab dan als ik dan scheel de zaal in keek lagen de mensen dubbel kon ik echt niets aan doen de regisseur zei ga dan met je rug naar de zaal staan begonnen ze nog harder te lachen ik heb dat nog steeds maar ik maak me daar niet meer druk over sinds johnnie kraaykamp me heeft geleerd dat de mensen juist komen voor die momenten dus geef ze die momenten dan ook
7125978 vooral omdat we die helemaal met elkaar hebben ontwikkeld niemand wist hoe dat zou uitpakken het was met bill van dijk ryan van den akker en het productieteam dag en nacht werken zonder zeuren

7125984 my baby lost his fingers when i pushed the shopping cart too close to the grocery store door
7125985 you have a choice whether to eat it or not
7125986 ok i am not going to lecture you about the dangers of narcotic pain medicines we both know how addictive they are you because you know how it feels when you dont have your vicodin me because ive seen many many many people just like you however there are a few things i can tell you that would make us both much happier by following a few simple rules our little clinical transaction can go more smoothly and well both be happier because you get out of the er quicker the first rule is be nice to the nurses they are underpaid overworked and have a lot more influence over your stay in the er than you think when you are tempted to treat them like shit because they are not the ones who write the rx remember i might write for you to get a shot of 2mg of dilaudid but your behavior toward the nurses determines what percent of that dilaudid is squirted onto the floor before you get your shot the second rule is pick a simple non dangerous non verifiable painful condition which doesnt require me to do a four thousand dollar work up in order to get you out of the er if you tell me that you headache started suddenly and is the worst headache of your life you will either end up with a spinal tap or signing out against medical advice without an rx for pain medicine the parts of the story that you think make you sound pitiful and worthy of extra narcotics make me worry that you have a bleeding aneurysm and while i am 99 sure its not im not willing to lay my license and my families future on the line for your ass i also dont want to miss the poor bastard who really has a bleed so everyone with that history gets a needle in the back just stick to a history of your typical pain that is totally the same as i usually get and we will both be much happier the third rule related to 2 is never rate your pain a 10 10 10 10 means the worst pain you could possibly imagine ive seen people in a 10 10 pain and you sitting there playing tetris on your cell phone are not in 10 10 pain 10 10 pain is an open fracture dangling in the wind a 50 body surface deep partial thickness burn or the pain of a real cerebral aneurysm even when i passed a kidney stone the worst pain i had was probably a 7 and that was when i was projectile vomiting and crying for my mother so stick with a nice 7 or even an 8 that means to me you are hurting by you might not be lying see below the fourth rule is never ever ever lie to me about who you are or your history if you come to the er and give us a fake name so we cant get your old records i will assume you are a worse douchetard than you really are more importantly though it will really really piss me the fuck off pissing off the guy who writes the rx you want does not work to your advantage the fifth rule is dont assume i am an idiot i went to medical school that is certainly no guarantee that i am a rocket scientist i know hell i went to school with a few people who were a couple of french fries short of a happy meal however i also got an er residency spot which means i was in the top quarter or so of my class this means it is a fair guess i am a reasonably smart guy so if i read your triage note and 1 you list allergies to every non narcotic pain medicine ever made 2 you have a history of migraines fibromyalgia and lumbar disk disease and 3 your doctor is on vacation only has clinic on alternate tuesdays or is dead i am smart enough to read that as you are scamming for some vicodin that in and of itself wont necessarily mean you dont get any pain medicine hell the fucktards who list and allergy to tylenol but who can take vicodin which contains tylenol are at least good for a few laughs at the nurses station however if you give that history everyone in the er from me to the guy who mops the floor will know you are a lying douchetard who is scamming for vicodin see rule 4 about lying the sixth and final rule is wait your fucking turn if the nurse triages you to the waiting room but brings patients who arrived after you back to be treated first that is because this is an emergency room and they are sicker than you are you getting a fix of vicodin is not more important than the 6 year old with a severe asthma attack telling the nurse at triage that now your migraine is giving you chest pain since you have been sitting a half hour in the waiting area to try to force her into taking you back sooner is a recipe for making all of us hate you even if you end up coming back immediately i will make it my mission that night to torment you you will not get the pain medicine you want under any circumstances and i firmly believe that if you manipulate your way to the back and make a 19 year old young woman with an ectopic pregnancy that might kill her in a few hours wait even a moment longer to be seen i should be able to piss in a glass and make you drink it before you leave the er so if you keep these few simple rules in mind our interaction will go much more smoothly i dont really give a shit if i give 20 vicodins to a drug seeker before i was burnt out in the er i was a hippy and i would honestly rather give that to ten of you guys than make one person in real pain unrelated to withdrawal suffer however if you insist on waving a flourescent orange flag that says i am a drug seeker and pissing me and the nurses off with your behavior i am less likely to give you that rx you dont want that i dont want that so lets keep this simple easy and well all be much happier sincerely your friendly neighborhood er doctor

7126007 musikfest is an economic boost for local businesses but apparently for dent if an event wont help him raise money or gain more pats on the back from big oil hes not interested
7126008 in this world of sin and sorrow there is always something to be thankful for as for me i rejoice that i am not a republican
7126009 it looked from here like a guy casually sitting in his car listening to the radio
7126010 you gave us three performances tonight that were as good as anything weve ever heard on this show
7126011 for those of you at home remember this is a singing contest and you just heard some great singing from brian melo

7126013 it will make the mud tired were killing the mud softly
7126014 with our nation at war our economy in recession we know the american people can not afford four more years of the same old policies and the same old politics we know that a time for change has come
7126015 we cannot as a nation stand four more years of this
7126016 its not a problem john mccain has hell have to decide which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7126017 we believe our tomorrows will be better than our yesterdays that literally has been the american way and it will be that way again but theres a missing piece and that piece is leadership
7126018 these times require a wise leader a leader who can deliver the change we need
7126019 you cant change america when you support george bushs policies 95 percent of the time
7126020 you learn a lot about a man when you campaign with him
7126021 ladies and gentleman no one knows better than i do that presidential campaigns are crucibles in which youre challenged every single day ive watched barack obama face it with steel in his spine
7126022 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7126023 committing record amounts of time money and energy this election to educate voters about john mccains anti worker agenda and elect barack obama and joe biden and a pro worker majority in congress
7126024 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7126025 when its time for straight answers clear conviction and decisive action
7126026 should be a grave concern to reasonable people of good will on both sides of this issue
7126027 the history guy warfare and conflict between kosovar albanians and serbs since 1912
7126028 mosport is a track which is very challenging for setup we have to get to the right compromise for both very fast turns and very slow turns we are still working on getting the right mix we arent there yet but expect to be by race start tomorrow
7126029 i had the same car during qualifying that i did in the last practice session but suddenly i no longer had the same grip it was very frustrating and a disappointing result
7126030 this was a difficult qualifying session for me the first time i put on new tires at the start of qualifying it was very tough to find a good balance with the car but im confident well get to where we need to be by the race
7126031 the vast and irreversible effects of the invasion of georgia will be felt everywhere in the ex soviet bloc and not just there each of the ex bloc countries has what could be called its own pro russia party which is hostile to the democratic revolutions
7126032 the strengthening of the pro russia parties will be met at first by an increased hostility from the democratic parties the genuinely democratic parties and some of the not so genuine ones political tensions are therefore bound to rise all across the region not just between the ex bloc countries and russia but within each of the ex bloc countries a rise in domestic tensions will have the unavoidable effect however of yet again increasing in the short term the credibility of threats from the pro russia parties the pressure on the democratic parties to relinquish their hostility to the pro russia parties will therefore grow in the months to come and a degree of power will shift to the pro russia parties on a regional and not just a local level poland will be an exception to this development if only because poland appears to have made a fundamental national choice to go down fighting rather than submit yet again to russia but polish defiance has merely meant that poland instead of undergoing the political tensions that are about to embroil the other countries has leapfrogged to a still higher stage of tension which is military the poles have already found themselves being threatened overtly with military assault and even nuclear attack by top figures of the russian military a shocking development
7126033 in most cases a patrol car will respond to a call only when life is threatened or a burglary is in progress
7126034 every time i hear wendy speak i learn something new not just about cape wind but about politics in america she embodies the best of this countrys journalistic tradition reminding us all why a free press is so critical to a free society
7126035 i loved the way you framed the issue as being primarily about democracy rather then clean energy i think that is a critical point that has been left out of this debate
7126036 enough political intrigue to keep a john grisham fan happy
7126037 a ripe subject populated with the sort of people who would be among the first to count themselves as friends of the earth but the last to accept an environmentally friendly energy source if it meant the slightest cloud on their ocean views
7126038 this is a profound article on where were being led in the name of perfect health and bodies and in the war on obesity

7126050 war is an ugly thing but not the ugliest of things the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse the person who has nothing for which he is willing to fight nothing which is more important than his own personal safety is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself
7126051 a disability like gender and ethnicity is simply one of many natural characteristics of being human

7126063 iran doesnt pose anywhere near the threat to the united states that the soviet union did
7126064 if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to the united states
7126065 iran is a serious threat if it gets nuclear weapons
7126066 but i also know how much i love america he obama said we americans are a people of improbable hope with an eye towards the future with resolve in our americas heart let us americans remember this history and answer our americas destiny and let us americans remake the world once again
7126067 but again the broader point was the extreme flagrant and rather annoying self confidence of a man who has virtually no foreign policy experience and has only been a senator for 4 years 2 of which he has spent not senatoring but running for another office
7126068 hey just sit back and embrace it in fact learn spanish
7126069 by the time 2016 rolls around well have more cameras than washington d c our technology is more advanced than any other city in the world even compared to london dealing with our cameras and the sophistication of cameras and retro fitting all the cameras downtown in new buildings doing the cta cameras

7126077 the impact of global warming is brutal and tragic for polar bears
7126078 the only way to limit the number of bears that will drown and starve is to reduce greenhouse gas pollution immediately
7126079 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation
7126080 the bears that had been on that last bit of ice that remained over shallow shelf waters are now swimming either toward land or toward the rest of the sea ice which is a considerable distance north
7126081 we have some observations of bears swimming into shore when the sea ice was not visible on the horizon
7126082 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
7126083 our impression is that this is one of the increasing risk factors that bears are facing as the sea ice habitat where they need to forage is disappearing and such risks were considered in the recent projections we made regarding future welfare of polar bears
7126084 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals their home is on the surface of the ice
7126085 to find so many animals at sea in a single survey on a single day is extremely significant

7126105 i wish everyone would follow the rules and not be just self centered
7126106 but is what youre saying that the president was basically irrelevant during the first few minutes after the second attack
7126107 well no not during the minutes he was in the chair fleischer well clearly not in those minutes he was in the chair but keep in mind also that the president is not the finder of facts the finders of facts are more along the lines of the colonels and lt colonels who work in the national security council and at the department of defense or the federal aviation administration those are the people who are on the front lines who are in communication with whats happening on the ground and then that information filters up to the president through either his national security advisor andy card or whoever it comes from
7126108 gross but in a situation where seconds count as we well learned that day why wouldnt the president want to immediately get to a secure phone so he could immediately or as soon as he was ready or needed be on the phone with whoever on his staff or the military if he needs to

7126114 wont just make a good vice president he will make a great vice president
7126115 he is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7126116 this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7126117 the times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
7126118 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7126119 today is a special day we hope its the beginning we have opened the path and we hope there will be more travellers

7126137 this is an opportunity to determine what is a fair and equitable distribution of water between states
7126138 if huge amounts of water are taken out it could be a problem for us down the road
7126139 we need to determine what is a fair and equitable distribution of water between two states
7126140 would both adversely affect the water quantity and quality in the south carolina portion of the catawba river
7126141 were being portrayed as reckless users of water but what would opponents have us do
7126142 its obvious that water now and for the future will be a huge issue so weve got to stop fighting these turf wars and come up with ways to work together

7126157 was accused of plagiarism when he did not credit neil kinnock then leader of the british labor party for much of his stump speech
7126158 john quinlan a reporter for the sioux city journal said his notes showed biden said he was quoting kinnock when he used the same passage in a speech aug 14 stories in the new york times the boston globe and other newspapers also said biden had used the rhetoric and credited kinnock for it

7126161 surge of us troops to iraq that mr bush ordered in early 2007
7126162 real central front in the war on terrorism is not iraq
7126163 if we should have had a surge anywhere it is afghanistan senator biden said in a recent opinion article in the
7126164 afghanistans fate is directly tied to pakistans future and americas security
7126165 the recent pakistani elections gave the moderate majority its voice back senator biden wrote
7126166 to demonstrate to its people that we care about their needs not just our own we must triple assistance for schools roads and clinics sustain it for a decade and demand accountability for the military aid we provide
7126167 i believe the united states should agree to directly engage iran first in the context of the p 5 plus 1 and ultimately country to country just as we did with north korea senator biden said in an early july press statement
7126168 the net effect of demanding preconditions that iran rejects is this we get no results and iran gets closer to the bomb he said

7126173 i have long sought to help russia realise its extraordinary potential as a force for progress in the international community and have supported legislative efforts intended to forge a more constructive relationship with the kremlin

7126196 under none of the scenarios was it contemplated that the government would taking this subsidy into account make a net profit from taking northern rock into the public sector
7126197 ministers considered that this share of the returns was disproportionate to the share of risk borne by the taxpayer or in other words the private provider would receive an excessive return relative to the risk taken
7126198 the value of the additional equity will be reflected in the sale price for northern rock on return to the private sector
7126199 i was interested to see what it was because ive worked with a team of people involved in monitoring and forecasting aphids those of greenfly and their relatives in this country
7126200 i looked at it with my team and we thought we could identify it down to the level of genus but we had no idea what the species was
7126201 i had thought it would be rather nice to call it
7126202 unfortunately using flippant names to describe new species is rather frowned upon these days
7126203 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
7126204 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
7126205 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
7126206 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
7126207 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
7126208 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
7126209 it could be like something out of a greek myth
7126210 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
7126211 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
7126212 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
7126213 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
7126214 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
7126215 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
7126216 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
7126217 we think that the intersection of these two features being so close to indian point makes it a place of greater risk than most other points on the map
7126218 most people underestimate the hazard here any conservative approach will look at geologically similar environments if you do that we are similar to bhuj india where a 2001 magnitude 7 quake killed over 15 000 people there was no obvious sign of strain there there is a mystery here to be solved and we better step back and do our homework
7126219 once you accept that one fault in a family is active you better consider that all the faults in that family could be active we need to adapt our structures with that in mind
7126220 you could debate whether a magnitude 6 or 7 is possible but weve already had three magnitude fives so that is very realistic there is no one now alive now to remember that last one so people tend to forget and having only a partial 300 year history we may not have seen everything we could see there could be surprises things bigger than we have ever seen
7126221 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off
7126222 as we see this phenomenon occurring further and further north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
7126223 its a signal but we dont know what it means
7126224 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
7126225 this data allows investigators to identify suspects examine their contacts establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time
7126226 combining two different sources of data has the tendency to increase your false positive rate or your false negative rate
7126227 if youre looking for burglars in a run down district where 50 per cent of men have a criminal conviction you may find plenty but if youre trying to find terrorists among airline passengers where they are extremely rare then almost all your hits will be false
7126228 currently there are no good patterns available to recognise terrorists
7126229 now in 2008 these very characteristics are presented as value added selling points in the company advertisement of its product
7126230 the efficiency and reliability of such tools is as yet unknown
7126231 more surveillance does not necessarily lead to a higher level of societal security hence there must be a thorough examination of whether the resulting massive constraints on human rights are proportionate and justified
7126232 we implement stringent safeguards to prevent misuse of such systems for unauthorised purposes in all countries where we operate we do business strictly according to the nokia siemens networks standard code of conduct and un and eu export regulations
7126233 if we discover a desire within us that nothing in this world can satisfy also we should begin to wonder if perhaps we were created for another world

7126260 before the us economy can truly begin to expand again the savings rate must rise to pre bubble levels of 8pc that the us housing stocks must fall to below eight months supply and that the household interest coverage ratio must fall from 14pc to 10 5pc
7126261 its important to note what sort of surgery that is going to require we will probably have to eliminate 2 trillion of household debt to get there

7126299 i was elated when i got my results i worked really hard and i knew i would do well but i did not expect this
7126300 and i want to be able to do something to help other children because i know
7126301 the colonial authorities consistently tried to dehumanise the people who came here by changing their religion their language and their art forms because they saw that as a way of controlling them but they did not succeed so we have today this wonderful culture that they have contributed to this land and that has become part of the guyanese culture
7126302 an exemplary guyanese whom a lot can be learnt from
7126303 no one can take away that he is an example for all who would wish to walk in his footsteps
7126304 a splendid example of progress from poverty to stellar achievements
7126305 yesu persaud is a splendid example of progress from poverty to stellar achievements
7126306 his notion of helping people to help themselves is the most effective way of eradicating poverty
7126307 he is one of the persons who never hesitated to allow a person to realize their fullest potential
7126308 we ought to be thankful as a country for people like persaud
7126309 no one can take away that he is an example for all who would wish to walk in his footsteps

7126313 the diaspora of indians in ancient times to the countries of south east asia and the annals of those kingdoms by the hindu colonists were quite unlike the later european ways of colonization
7126314 indians went out of their country without any sort of backing of any of the indian states
7126315 hindus left their motherland to settle abroad in colonies and not to make fortune and run back to motherland it was diaspora in the truest sense where the penetration of hindu civilization culture languages in south east asia took place so peacefully that the indigenous population never felt that their country had been taken over
7126316 this is no mean achievement in spite of the initial handicaps and owes a lot to the innate vitality of the indian civilization
7126317 but new yorks a very hard place to leave and once you do leave
7126318 i still miss it and i left twelve years ago
7126319 but you were in business together right thats what my note says
7126320 so is there anything you can tell me about his milieu
7126321 well you know who he hung out with what kind of trouble he might have gotten himself into any shady characters
7126322 we want to ensure they are keeping their roots and connections with india
7126323 this was a mistake the anc had made it disbanded the congress and it took over the apartheid stooges
7126324 as a political party the anc was fine and totally acceptable but to organise better the indian people needed an organisation
7126325 i wrote to mr mbeki soon after he became president in 1999 that it had been a tragedy that the anc had asked the nic to be disbanded it was an organisation that stood by the anc always
7126326 no one in his or her right frame of mind would have said these things given this the best option would be for the teacher to be assigned to a desk job and not be allowed to be near youngsters anymore
7126327 the allegations were serious as no one was allowed to insult others especially in a school environment
7126328 we all know and speak highly of mahatma gandhi but very few people will ever give recognition to the fact that without the support of the indian community in south africa the name mahatma gandhi would not even have been a footnote in history
7126329 gandhis experiments in satyagraha his experiments in harnessing non violence as a power of truth and bearing witness against oppression proved successful because the mahatmas call received a response from the indian community of this country
7126330 so satyagraha is the singular contribution that south africans of indian descent have made to the history of not only south africa and india but many other parts of the world
7126331 there is a tendency especially today to relegate the role of various communities and individuals to the background that is very wrong it is an injustice and i think it is a misrepresentation of the truth
7126332 we are making india into a strong country strong in its independence

7126338 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of united states of america joe biden
7126339 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now

7126348 i think that was part of the problem yesterday having that whole day off and not doing any treatments
7126349 global trends are moving towards advertising online rather than traditional media
7126350 the next step in that evolution is to advertise on mobile handsets providing rich targeted content to the customer
7126351 what makes this platform so unique is the fact that customers can choose to download the software and view the advertising
7126352 as the eyeballs paybacks accumulate they can either have automatic loading of airtime as they reach a certain total or they can choose to be sent a pin on request free airtime can also then be transferred to a sibling child or anyone else they choose
7126353 we also believe that our customers should be rewarded for telling their friends about us our invite a friend program will allow our users to receive additional eyeballs paybacks for those friends they have referred to us
7126354 eyeballs mobile allows advertisers to determine exactly which customers they would like to target with their advertisements and our metrics allow us to report on the exact profile of the people who have viewed the advertisements
7126355 this will minimise wastage and assist in customising advertising messages for specific target audiences
7126356 as a user you get the choice to download the software view the advertisements and collect rewards or not
7126357 and while we believe the combination of rich content and rewards will be reason enough for our customers to use this platform there will be random cash prizes up for grabs during the launch month

7126384 has lost my vote my familys vote and i believe a large percent of hillary supporters
7126385 could have been an easy win for the democratic ticket i thought obama was smarter than that i guess i was wrong
7126386 no wonder obama revealed his choice in the dead of the night and buried this over the weekend
7126387 all hillary supporters will lick their wounds and support the obama biden ticket bidens experience will be invaluable as they decide what will work and what will not
7126388 brings instant credibility on foreign policy and the current inner workings of washington
7126389 sure obamas all about change but you dont get to real change without first understanding how the current system works and how to influence that process in a new direction
7126390 will allay the fears of floating voters who are leaning toward voting obama in november but have concerns over his limited foreign policy experience
7126391 will send shock down the spine of the mccain team which is making foreign policy the centerpiece of its campaign also bidens selection enhances obamas chances of winning in pa and doing well with blue collar voters
7126392 the speaker we heard on that sunny day in newark was the same joe biden that barack obama was thinking of when he made his vice presidential choice this week smart focused clear concise humorous and warmly engaging
7126393 in the face of the flood of cynicism and skepticism that characterizes so many of our views of washington politicians these days biden is one of the very few washington insiders who manages to maintain his constituents faith and hope and trust
7126394 i was waiting to see who obama was going to pick because i thought that would tell a lot about the direction he wanted to take his presidency
7126395 if hes willing to listen to biden hes heading in the right direction i think it really shows strength in his character that hes able to accept a man who really criticized him and to listen to him that says a lot about him
7126396 all of a sudden its not just about history and change and how far weve come since 1968 its about can we really move forward and yeah with that kind of ambition from obama and that kind of perseverance from biden we can do that
7126397 while i have nothing against joe biden i am disgusted and for the first time ever i have no clue who to vote for i know obamas big message is change so he picks a running mate that has been in dc longer than i have been old enough to vote he picked biden because of his experience which sounds logical but how is he going to change with a certified member of old washington on the ticket
7126398 bidens irish catholic working class roots are ones that i can relate to as an hispanic voter i remember sen biden during the gulf war and have always thought he was a straight shooter and very credible statesman sen biden provides the wisdom factor he is truly a senior statesman and his foreign policy experience is very reassuring during these times sen biden more than makes up for all the shortcomings that obama has in my opinion im elated that he has been chosen for vp position this kind of leadership is exactly what the democratic party and our country needs
7126399 obamas choice was a very smart one i have always appreciated joe bidens directness and i feel he gives nice balance to the ticket obama is smart enough to admit that he doesnt know everything and does have weaknesses and he selected someone who has great knowledge in those areas the presidential ticket is now very well rounded and i believe the election has just been won by the democrats also smart move on the announcement the plan was to build anticipation and they certainly succeeded every news channel was standing by for the announcement had me turning on the news as soon as i woke up to hear it kudos
7126400 the greatest charge against john mccain has been that he has been in washington too long to make a difference in the white house with the addition of sen joe biden the obama campaign can no longer make this charge perhaps the greatest problem with his vice presidential selection is that we all know joe biden and weve written him off after several failed attempts at the presidency all that obama has managed to do with this pick is alert the world that john mccain is right he does have a glaring weakness in foreign policy
7126401 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur

7126406 defense minister anatoly serdyukov has reported to the commander in chief president dmitry medvedev on the completion of the order to pull out from georgian territory russian troops sent to reinforce peacekeepers
7126407 peacekeeping checkpoints in the security zone have started carrying out the tasks set before them
7126408 the fact of the pullout of occupying forces from the main towns under enormous pressure from the international community is a good start and a step in the right direction
7126409 but we should not be under any illusions as our road to freedom will be long
7126410 the russians want to have eight peacekeeping checkpoints outside south ossetia but that is not agreed with us or with the international mediators
7126411 it is not russias right to decide unilaterally how many checkpoints will be here it will be the subject of further negotiations
7126412 it is my understanding that they have not completely withdrawn from areas considered undisputed territory and they need to do that
7126413 all the forces but those that were involved in the region before august 7 and secondly that their ability to patrol is limited to a small area
7126414 in short were going home peace to all countries what else can i say theres no need for war there should be friendship
7126415 were just doing our bit were following orders were leaving here now
7126416 the officer explained the situation this way at the roki tunnel 150 officers of the fsb russias federal security service are searching the columns of vehicles very thoroughly and it takes a lot of time
7126417 theyre doing this in order to make sure that the soldiers dont take any looted goods or weapons or maybe even money that dont belong to them so everyone is being checked and as the officer said that is why this process of withdrawal has dragged on for so long
7126418 in order to stop groups of looters and prevent the delivery of unaccounted for weapons and ammunition
7126419 18 peacekeeping surveillance posts have been set up along the administrative border between georgia and south ossetia
7126420 units of the georgian armed forces are concentrating in central georgia restoring their combat capability and preparing for further actions
7126421 georgian forces are carrying out reconnaissance into the character and direction of the actions of russian troops and south ossetian formations and are preparing military actions in the georgia south ossetia conflict zone
7126422 yesterday august 21 general borisov had a fairly heated discussion with gori regional governor vladimer vardzelashvili about the so called buffer zone borisov had all kinds of maps out and was referring to the 1992 cease fire agreement which stipulates that the conflict zone included quite a lot of villages north of gori in gori district including two villages that are located along the main east west highway shavshvebi and agara
7126423 so if we go with that interpretation it would mean that the so called peacekeepers who would replace the regular russian troops would have the right to control the main highway and even establish checkpoints
7126424 as far as i know senaki would not be in any buffer zone
7126425 senaki is about 40 kilometers away from the border with abkhazia there is i believe a 14 kilometer zone on either side of the administrative border between abkhazia and the rest of georgia the russians definitely have the right to patrol that area under the old agreements senaki is way away from there what the russians are saying is that it falls into the zone of responsibility of the peacekeepers i havent heard them refer to a specific document that gives them the right to stay in senaki or poti
7126426 there is going to be a huge need for western aid when the russians finally do ship out and it looks like it is going to come
7126427 if the aid comes fast if it is significant then i think president mikheil saakashvili may be able to turn around and say look this was always coming anyway
7126428 if he can say all those things then hes in a stronger position but a lot will depend on the speed and quantity of the aid
7126429 tell me what can you want youve got it all things are real in a handshake rest my bones these days in a different way cherish the change it may not stay i remember your dress like dreams when you wake with a sudden start youre beside me in the dark wrapped in my arms love is being entranced in a glance to muster up courage when youre flustered to stumble on the words you prepare dont worry about the money that went down the drain because the best things in life are free
7126430 right now i feel like nothing ive been writing has a definitive point of aim i feel like you just need to keep writing until the writing itself just begins to take shape
7126431 estas sentencias son completamente abusivas en nuestras conclusiones pedimos la libertad de estas personas con base a la presunci n de inocencia es inaplazable desmontar por completo el modelo de represi n contra las expresiones de disidencia social y pol tica en este sentido resulta urgente que las procuradur as estatales y la general de la rep blica procedan a archivar todos los procedimientos en que la acusaci n se base en el patr n represivo referido con anterioridad as como proceder a revisar la situaci n de privaci n de libertad de todos los presos pol ticos y de conciencia

7126434 but with the mccains money in cindy mccains name as dictated by a prenuptial agreement the senators finances are more difficult to assess and scrutinize than those of many other political candidates
7126435 but the hensley family wealth from its rough and tumble origins to prominence in arizonas corporate world is also the fortune that propelled john mccain into national politics a clearer picture of that fortune emerges from a review of public records and interviews with employees business associates friends and relatives
7126436 now on the verge of his 72nd birthday mccain is trying once again to strike the right balance this time in pursuit of the presidency he is offering himself both as a rabble rouser and a reliable republican standard bearer he has written dismissively of the obfuscation of politics but hes also trimmed his sails in pursuit of the prize he has worried that the idea of a being maverick may be getting tired but insists hes got the energy and ideas to inspire a dispirited nation
7126437 it is never too late to do the right thing
7126438 en faisant tout de m me attention ce quil natterrisse pas dans les mains des trop jeunes
7126439 today is a special day we hope its the beginning we have opened the path and we hope there will be more travellers
7126440 in order to avoid a well publicised provocation in the middle of the sea
7126441 because we know who is on the boats and what they contain we will allow them to land
7126442 the arrival of the two ships after this adventure represents a big breakthrough in the wall of the israeli siege imposed on gaza
7126443 the journey was long and hard we had a lot of rough weather out of cyprus a lot of people got sick but it was worth it
7126444 the beginning of an end to the siege only if other organisations and friendly countries allow people to sail towards gaza
7126445 wont just make a good vice president he will make a great vice president
7126446 he is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7126447 this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7126448 the times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
7126449 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7126450 proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7126451 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7126452 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7126453 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7126454 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7126455 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7126456 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7126457 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7126458 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7126459 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7126460 we will be seeking more specific information about why he was picked up and held and about his experience during his incarceration
7126461 el md anderson es el mejor centro de c ncer en el mundo y nosotros queremos copiar usar y aprender de su modelo para construir el mejor centro que podamos en puerto rico
7126462 un elemento central es el intercambio de informaci n cient fica para la educaci n de profesionales que trabajan con pacientes de c ncer pues se entiende la importancia de la educaci n para puerto rico dado que el c ncer es una de las causas principales de enfermedad y muerte
7126463 tenemos que enfocarnos en cu n importante es tener un centro comprensivo de neurooncolog a se necesita un lugar que trabaje con los tumores que afectan el sistema nervioso que sea comprensivo para que atienda todas las necesidades de un paciente con tal tumor y para eso necesitas un equipo de especialistas multidisciplinarios
7126464 queremos buscar curas y soluciones un c ncer como la leucemia que tiene una probabilidad de cura excelente hace 40 a os ven a ya con un certificado de muerte
7126465 aunque la literatura indica que los tumores del sistema nervioso central son m s comunes en hombres en puerto rico se operan m s mujeres 58 por ciento no se sabe si por razones gen ticas del ambiente o raciales o simplemente porque las mujeres en puerto rico est n m s dispuestas a operarse que los hombres
7126466 and last night i decided to pick it up after i finished another book id been reading
7126467 hes got bat speed and can hit for power said
7126468 he could end up as a corner guy but he can play center field
7126469 is that he was not afraid of controversy or conflict he was a combative player and he was the same way when he fought for the players
7126470 but he also was a visionary that too is his legacy he was smart enough to recognize that if you make progress at someone elses expense that can come back and haunt you if you get a deal that is so sweet it leaves others wanting what have you really accomplished you have to leave something on the table
7126471 i would never leave until this new deal is done
7126472 mr upshaws secretary spoke to him then called back within a half hour
7126473 she said of course he remembers alva who was his teammate for a year they paid for the funeral but didnt want any publicity
7126474 im just trying to get an opinion on what i need to do how bad the injury is and if i can do anything to play
7126475 im going to do the best i can to get back on the field and get ready for carolina
7126476 the pressure is going to be how do we get this war right

7126479 were not in the blair kind of situation but it may come
7126480 god isnt interested in religion but rather in a relationship
7126481 russia was not the soviet union or the evil empire
7126482 sekiranya dia benar dia akan selamat tetapi jika dia berbohong lambat laun kelaknatan allah akan turun kepadanya dalam berbagai perkara yang tidak tergambar oleh dirinya sendiri
7126483 keberanian saiful melafazkan lafaz yang seperti itu menunjukkan samada dia meyakini apa yang dia dakwa ataupun dia tidak faham akan kesan terhadap lafaz berkenaan pada masa hadapan
7126484 bukan mudah seseorang melafazkan sumpah mubahalah itu melainkan dia dalam keadaan tidak siuman ataupun dia sedar apa yang diyakini itu benar
7126485 oleh kerana akan timbul kesangsian pihak yang di cabar dan untuk menghilangkan keraguan masyarakat maka pihak yang didakwa iaitu datuk seri anwar ibrahim hendaklah melafazkan sumpah bermubahalah dengan bentuk yang sama maka jadilah mubahalah yang mana kita akan lihat hukuman tuhan nanti
7126486 sesungguhnya sebelum kedatangan dajjal dalam riwayat yang lain sebelum kiamat adanya tahun tahun yang penuh tipu daya
7126487 ya allah aku berlindung dengan mu daripada aku sesat atau disesatkan gelincir atau digelincirkan menzalimi atau dizalimi bodoh atau aku diperbodohkan
7126488 wahai orang orang yang beriman jika datang kepada kamu seorang fasik membawa sesuatu berita maka selidikilah untuk menentukan kebenarannya supaya kamu tidak menimpakan sesuatu kaum dengan perkara yang tidak diingini dengan sebab kejahilan kamu sehingga menjadikan kamu menyesali apa yang kamu telah lakukan
7126489 aku tidak melihat kezuhudan itu paling kurang melainkan dalam perkara kepimpinan kuasa engkau akan dapati seseorang yang zuhud dalam makanan minuman harta dan pakaian tetapi apabila tiba soal kuasa maka dia akan mempertahan dan bermusuhan kerananya
7126490 aku dan dua orang lelaki dari kaumku telah masuk kepada nabi saw
7126491 sesungguhnya kami tidak melantik dalam urusan ini sesiapa yang memintanya atau bercita cita untuk mendapatkannya
7126492 kamu semua begitu bercita cita terhadap jawatan kepimpinan ia akan menjadi penyesalan pada hari kiamat ia sesuatu yang nikmat pada permulaannya tapi keburukan pada akhirnya
7126493 jadikanlah aku mentadbir perbendaharaan hasil bumi mesir sesungguhnya aku sedia menjaganya dengan sebaik baiknya lagi mengetahui cara mentadbirkannya dan demikianlah caranya kami tetapkan kedudukan yusuf memegang kuasa di bumi mesir dia bebas tinggal di negeri itu di mana sahaja yang disukainya kami limpahkan rahmat kami kepada sesiapa sahaja yang kami kehendaki dan kami tidak menghilangkan balasan baik orang orang yang berbuat kebaikan

7126498 persistent divergences in growth and inflation figures across euro area countries
7126499 we have to broaden the scope of our surveillance beyond the fiscal sphere in order to better anticipate and manage the risks of macroeconomic imbalances developing within euro area countries
7126500 gdp growth and productivity performance have underperformed compared to other economies in an environment of global growth
7126501 i dont even have a number to call her at

7126504 unfortunately there were people there you could see them in the cockpit video they were iraqi soldiers its no great way to die the generals love napalm it has a big psychological effect
7126505 safwan hill went up in a huge fireball and the observation post was obliterated
7126506 we completed destruction of our last batch of napalm on 4 april 2001
7126507 most of the world understands that napalm and incendiaries are a horrible horrible weapon
7126508 it takes up an awful lot of medical resources it creates horrible wounds
7126509 you can call it something other than napalm but it is still napalm it has been reformulated in the sense that they now use a different petroleum distillate but that is it the us is the only country that has used napalm for a long time i am not aware of any other country that uses it
7126510 its orwellian they do not want the public to know its a lie

7126521 i am not diana the film is not about diana
7126522 the two were related by ancestry and united by destiny
7126523 there is absolutely no reason to have done this trailer which is a bad joke
7126524 the marketing people probably thought the only way they could get the young popcorn eating brigade to see this film was if they made some comparison with diana but they did not need to and should not have done it
7126525 we didnt want to make any parallels between the two women whatsoever
7126526 it didnt govern the shooting of the film or the performances
7126527 trailers should be what the film is about but in this case the trailer is not connected to the film
7126528 i dont actually think that georgiana died in a carriage crash

7126540 i really felt the sincerity of the group and i became curious on what they were doing for others
7126541 i was so touched by gks message about helping the less fortunate
7126542 it bothered me so much that when i went to the philippines i saw my relatives struggling economically i helped and gave but i could only give so much so in a sense i felt helpless but with gk i find my help limitless now because its not just me im part of the community that gives and helps out unconditionally
7126543 listening to tony speak was something else hes the driving force behind gk and just hearing his passion and vision was truly an inspiring experience
7126544 we didnt really know what we were going to do as a fundraiser

7126550 there will be no sanctions if members fail to ratify the asean charter but we committed we will do all efforts to sign and implement the charter
7126551 it has been submitted to the senate i dont want to comment hopefully they will have hearings when sessions resume were not the only one that has not ratified the others are thailand and indonesia
7126552 what president arroyo said is that some senators will have a problem ratifying she was saying her view but its a priority for us the charter
7126553 we wanted the philippines to cooperate in the aspect of ratification if they will not ratify there may be a problem

7126612 although it may be an unpleasant commentary on human nature a central driving force in defining a state is the desire to have a reasonably homogeneous population within its borders
7126613 political economy explains some of the benefits from having a homogeneous population within a given state if diversity is great measured say by the inequality in potential earnings then there is a strong incentive for people to spend their energies in efforts to redistribute income rather than to produce goods in particular a greater dispersion of constituent characteristics leads to the creation of interest groups that spend their time lobbying the central government to redistribute resources in their favor

7126627 wow youve got to be really lame if you spent time making a picture of something in a game
7126628 ive been very excited about this new feature in our game and now ive been given the go ahead to tell you about it
7126629 this morning when i was in my meeting with jim and dave and
7126630 not really sure whats going to happen in 2008 but no ones going to make a wowkiller some neat stuff will happen some other stuff will bomb i was 60 right on my predictions from last year give or take
7126631 usenet was great until all those aol newbies showed up
7126632 i love world of warcraft but i hate dealing with all the twelve year old morons and their chatspeak
7126633 this is a kids game if u r over 18 on here ur a pervert and im reportin u
7126634 i dont think adults should be on this game talking to children and it makes me uncomfortable
7126635 zomg the internet will stuff your child full of violence and porn and then theyll run away and be found in some strangers hotel room 500 miles away just like if they were listening to satan but if youre over 25 you can use the internet look up rachael ray recipes in peace no worries
7126636 sou uma pessoa boa de lidar mas problem tica no meu mundo desde que me conhe o sou honesto mas o meu sintoma e a vida s o desonestos comigo
7126637 non aucune fille na jamais simul avec moi et oui je men apercevrais tout de suite
7126638 thats because liking the same things and having sparks isnt enough to sustain a long term link
7126639 a lot of duos dont bring up important subjects because they fear itll damage the relationship
7126640 deep down they dont trust that their union could withstand real conflict but testing this assumption is the only way to see what the relationship is really made of
7126641 i used to believe that my ex and i were close because when one of us was pissed about something wed quickly hash it out
7126642 truth is the sole reason we could resolve things so fast was because we only addressed minor matters we were too chicken to get at the really important stuff concealing our true feelings brought on resentment and we eventually split
7126643 when i first became serious with my fianc i shared with him all the details of my life except that id spent my college years in a physically abusive relationship
7126644 i was terrified that he would look down on me for mistakes i made a decade earlier but the more time we spent together the more secure i was that he wouldnt judge me when i let him in on the truth about my not so proud past he was more understanding than i could have hoped
7126645 divulging your most intimate info demonstrates that you can show your true self and you know it wont affect his attraction to you
7126646 ask yourself if he ever hints around about things from his past but doesnt really open up
7126647 if thats the case your union may be too one sided to last
7126648 any two partners can go through the motions but truly connected couples really communicate what turns them on which makes sex more exciting and intimate
7126649 with previous boyfriends i felt like i had to tiptoe around their technique in bed i thought that if i asked them to go faster or change direction theyd get upset
7126650 but my current guy and i are so open and eager to please each other we love giving each other dirty direction its made our pairing way more passionate than ive ever experienced
7126651 touching and kissing reinforce your closeness fusing you two even tighter
7126652 when a couple are silly together it shows that they arent afraid to let their guards down and expose their childlike guileless sides
7126653 also humor is how we cope with the pressures of day to day life if youre in tune with each others fun side youre better able to dodge relationship sabotaging stress
7126654 on our first date my now husband took me on a drive through the country and as soon as he turned up the radio we began singing along to really bad country songs
7126655 we crooned together through the entire hour long trip getting such a kick out of how we had the same cheesy sense of humor its been two years and were still getting cheesy with each other
7126656 when a guy is in sync with your thoughts your quirks and your way of doing things the relationship can deepen because you dont have to spend so much energy explaining yourself to him and vice versa
7126657 its not that you need him to pump your self esteem but once youve settled into a steady relationship you want to know that he still sees you as attractive
7126658 una delle ragioni perch non riusciamo ad accettare il nostro lato tranquillo perch non corrisponde allideale culturale in cui viviamo
7126659 nel suo libro the highly sensitive person elaine aronson espone i risultati di alcun importantissime ricerche che riguardano questo aspetto della cultura
7126660 essere in minoranza pu rendere ancora pi difficile accettarsi ma talvolta la semplice comprensione di questi fattori culturali fa diventare tale compito un po pi semplice quando mi capita una giornata storta e vorrei essere pi socievole mi aiuto ripensando a quello studio che metteva a confronto bambini cinesi e canadesi dico a me stessa che essere sensibili e tranquilli una gran cosa se vivessi in cina sarei molto popolare
7126661 check it out i went to tri state after and they just gave me a new knife haha god is so funny he rocks
7126662 it was not handled right by our officer but whether there was a violation of our policy that is subject to punishment i dont know
7126663 chill out its just a dog you can buy another one
7126664 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7126665 its great to be on pole position especially after the great disappointment of budapest but im well aware the race is tomorrow and so there is still a long way to go
7126666 today the track was still very slippery partly because of last nights rain after this mornings free practice i thought the harder tyres would be the most competitive in qualifying but at the start of the session i didnt feel as comfortable anymore and so we went for the softer compound
7126667 the team did a great job in preparing for this event and i want to thank them for giving me such a strong car i hope we can have a good race tomorrow
7126668 we knew we had a great car and we didnt have any problems during qualifying i felt really comfortable and i decided to qualify with the option tyre my first lap wasnt perfect and i lost almost one second compared with my second lap but on my final lap everything went well
7126669 second place on the grid is a good basis for tomorrows race however felipe massa was significantly faster in the first sector and i hope well be able to improve there tomorrow our team did a great job and im confident well be strong
7126670 this was a very good qualifying for the team and me after some unlucky races lately the pace of the car here in valencia is not that bad however there is still a small gap to ferrari and mclaren
7126671 qualifying went pretty smoothly with only the weather a bit unstable in the end there were only some rain drops in the second qualifying session but this did not affect the result the choice of tyres was pretty clear for me by yesterday i went on the harder compound in q1 and on the softer compound in q2 and q3
7126672 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time
7126673 it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly i still think i can be in the fight for the win especially if i manage to get a good start we have a good car which should be especially competitive in the race
7126674 the balance of my car was good and we improved continuously throughout the sessions however im a little disappointed with my fifth place on the grid as i didnt make any mistakes and performed to the maximum
7126675 its now up to us to score as many points as possible and make a good start from the cleaner side of the grid our strategy should help us to gain positions during the race

7126686 ich rate jedem abiturienten sich genau zu informieren was ihn in einem bestimmten studiengang erwartet
7126687 wir haben schon vor mehr als zehn jahren einen diplom studiengang logistik geschaffen und decken mit den vier lehrst hlen logistik f rder und lagertechnik verkehrssysteme und fabrikorganisation wirklich die gesamte prozesskette ab
7126688 ich wollte gerne in kleinen gruppen studieren in denen ich auch mal fragen stellen kann

7126712 maybe i will be fit for england but manchester united come first
7126713 i have felt it the tendinitis for the past 16 months but hopefully i will be back playing in a week or two
7126714 physically i demand a lot of myself i wish it wasnt the case but i just have to cope with it
7126715 obviously i am trying to get better i do a bit more every day
7126716 last season i was fit towards the end that is the reason the boss brought me here
7126717 obviously there is a big season ahead for manchester united and england and i want to be fit and available
7126718 ive said before we suffered on the counter attack when other teams play a 9 1 formation if you score a goal it changes completely
7126719 swim with the current in matters of principle stand like a rock
7126720 we have arrested raju pitti after we got information that he arrived hyderabad from the us he came to city to apply for anticipatory bail
7126721 more load would make the vehicle unstable and cause mishaps
7126722 first we had the cash for vote scam and now land for job these incidents signify the height of corruption
7126723 the prime minister should not maintain silence on the issue as this sends a wrong message that he is also hand in glove
7126724 se me escap en la ltima curva ven a bien estaba adentro se me fue por nada
7126725 the aim of art is to represent not the outward appearance of things but their inward significance
7126726 nobody including myself would have looked at this and thought it would work
7126727 gee could it be they are misrepresenting what russian leaders really said
7126728 in the event we think we are under attack we will of course destroy the abms in poland
7126729 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
7126730 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
7126731 the colonel general said that if poland allows part of the u s missile defence shield on its territory it will expose itself to a strike
7126732 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
7126733 how would we have reacted if moscow had brought western europe into the warsaw pact established bases in mexico and panama put missile defense radars and rockets in cuba and joined with china to build pipelines to transfer mexican and venezuelan oil to pacific ports for shipment to asia and cut us out if there were russian and chinese advisers training latin american armies the way we are in the former soviet republics how would we react would we look with bemusement on such russian behavior
7126734 something that captivates thats an immediate visceral reaction and that lingers in the memory
7126735 theres no better place than an amusement park to confront horror and things were fearful of
7126736 the fact that it took place near roller coasters and cotton candy sends an important message we here can engage in frivolity and fun at a time when in our name this is happening to people somewhere else
7126737 the idea behind this is the person is sucking in a little bit of water and a lot of air so they feel like theyre drowning the real power of the interrogator is the fear of the unknown
7126738 but i think if youre for or against this technique the conversation about this needs to start we need to recognize what it truly is which is torture
7126739 we are reaching a group of people that dont know about the subject
7126740 thats real wrong to torture someone and i wouldnt have put a dollar in if i knew
7126741 i dont think theres a need for that i dont like it
7126742 its our chance to be silly and political and educational all at the same time
7126743 perhaps youve heard of the man eating chicken or lobster boy who was not born with hands like you and me but pinching claws hes the only magician to perform sleight of claw
7126744 i saw it was kind of coming our way i told my wife to move toward the back of our deck
7126745 this will make our future a lot brighter in a lot of ways
7126746 we will be seeking more specific information about why he was picked up and held and about his experience during his incarceration

7126758 my goal is to help people better market their businesses
7126759 we replaced every press changed software and moved into new lines of work we can print more capacity now and can literally print on any surface from ceiling tiles to carpet if you can imagine it i can print on it
7126760 they walk into our showroom now and can tell right away theres a big difference now that the smell is gone
7126761 we have customers in all 50 states even hawaii and alaska and its exciting to me to educate them and help them grow their businesses
7126762 if they can provide us with a good database then we can customize each piece to that customers preferences if they only like red cars thats all theyll see if its an educational institution looking to market to high school juniors and the student is only interested in science then thats how their material will be produced
7126763 another mistake we see is when companies cut their marketing budgets especially in hard times
7126764 who would have thought that i could get a million and a half people to come to valdosta ga
7126765 the experience was incredible but the best part for me was opening the gates everyday if you do a good job and help someone else then youve accomplished something

7126771 statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7126772 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7126773 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7126774 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7126775 stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7126776 folks we come from very different places but we share a common story an american story he was the son of a single mom a single mom that had to struggle to support her son and her kid
7126777 i was an irish catholic kid with a father like many of yours in tough economic times and fell on hard times but my mom and dad raised me to believe my dad repeated it its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up
7126778 we cant afford four more years of a government that does nothing while they watch the housing market collapse
7126779 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7126780 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7126781 i think other than north korea and china no other country can achieve this in the world
7126782 foreigners admire this this is the chinese spirit we can make our human performance reach such a level through hard and smart work this is something many foreigners cannot achieve
7126783 i have conducted operas in the west it was so troublesome they only work four and a half days each week everyday there are two coffee breaks and no overtime work at all there cannot be any discomfort because of human rights this can really worry me to death
7126784 wow one week i thought i should already have rehearsed it the program very smoothly but they could not even stand in straight lines you could not criticize them either they all belong to some organizations they have all kinds of institutions unions
7126785 we can work very hard can withstand lots of bitterness we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in two months
7126786 we will be issuing court proceedings in september unless there is an acknowledgement by the police that there was a breach of human rights
7126787 that would be enough to stop us filing the papers which are being prepared but we have not had a substantive reply to a letter we sent to the force in may
7126788 this is not about money but the principle and i am confident that we will win on behalf of mr cunningham and mr abraham
7126789 most downtown residential high rises developed in seattle over the past few years cater to a narrow and elite demographic with 2116 fourth avenue we are going in a new direction with smaller units lower price points and a lower parking ratio
7126790 we are very excited about the prospect of designing a new residential tower for downtown seattle though recently many well designed towers have either been entitled or built we think there is still room to bring something special and unique to downtown
7126791 2008 will be remembered as a fantastic year with our best medal haul since 1908
7126792 we came here thinking we had 11 teams that could compete for medals
7126793 its getting tougher every year the other countries are hot on our heels

7126805 are arriving in emergency departments with serious and sometimes fatal injuries because they were not paying attention while texting american word for sms
7126806 people are texting and they trip and fall on their faces usually people in their 20s we see a lot of face chin mouth and eye injuries from falls
7126807 some people are actually on chicagos busy lakefront path texting while walking or exercising we see people rollerblading or biking while texting they are usually very skilled but sometimes crash and fall when they are not watching where they are going
7126808 in march we were driving and saw a woman in her 20s step off the curb and get struck square by a pickup truck she was unconscious and it appeared shed suffered a massive brain injury
7126809 you could tell she saw the truck at the last moment because her cell phone was dropped right where she was struck just off the curb and she was thrown about 20 or 30 feet it was horrifying

7126812 for five years almost i was expected to win every tournament i entered
7126813 other than on clay i was always expected to win
7126814 maybe now it changes a little bit because obviously theres a shift in the rankings
7126815 rafa will now feel what i had to feel for a very long time
7126816 but so far hes been great and played so well on all maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having number one next to me
7126817 i know what it takes to win the us open
7126818 thats always a huge advantage i have i come here as a defending champion so i always have great feelings about this place
7126819 this is quite a unique season rafa wasnt happy with the clay court season i was not particularly happy with scheduling at the olympics we all wish we would have had more time between wimbledon and the olympic games or after
7126820 but there was not really a whole lot we could do because of the olympic games every four years maybe there will be a tough season like this
7126821 next years schedule will already be much better well have much more time and wont be forced to play every single week
7126822 proud to stand firm with the next president of the united states of america barack obama
7126823 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7126824 ladies and gentlemen that is not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7126825 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7126826 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7126827 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7126828 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7126829 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7126830 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7126831 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now

7126842 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7126843 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7126844 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7126845 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7126846 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7126847 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7126848 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7126849 for five years almost i was expected to win every tournament i entered

7126853 but so far hes been great and played so well on all maybe its nice to go into a grand slam for a change not having number one next to me
7126854 i know what it takes to win the us open
7126855 thats always a huge advantage i have i come here as a defending champion so i always have great feelings about this place
7126856 this is quite a unique season rafa wasnt happy with the clay court season i was not particularly happy with scheduling at the olympics we all wish we would have had more time between wimbledon and the olympic games or after
7126857 but there was not really a whole lot we could do because of the olympic games every four years maybe there will be a tough season like this
7126858 next years schedule will already be much better well have much more time and wont be forced to play every single week

7126927 the ministry should do something more than issue statements its a shame that a summit of such a large scale doesnt have husains paintings

7126930 mark henderson the chief executive officer of gieves amp hawkes will discuss why savile row is eyeing the indian market
7126931 they have had big success in china and they want to replicate that in india
7126932 all over the world savile row stands for the very best in mens tailoring and so it is fitting that gieves amp hawkes should be no 1 savile row a remarkable address
7126933 if we follow our model of engagement used in china finding the right partner with local market knowledge is a crucial step as a small company we will not rush into any new ventures without careful consideration
7126934 our main international focus at the moment is supporting and driving the business in greater china a market we entered in the early 1990s we have nine stores in taiwan one in macau 47 in china and four in hong kong and the numbers continue to grow there can be differences trading in a country which isnt your home market but gieves amp hawkes values quality fit and knowledgeable service has universal appeal and this creates the potential for business
7126935 our business in china is focused on ready to wear garments but this is no different from the uk where ready to wear sales account for most of our business however we launched our personal tailoring service in hong kong late last year with the service rolling out to all flagship stores this year we certainly expect this to form a key area of growth for the business in greater china as it has proved itself to be in the uk market since its inception in 1999
7126936 are gieves amp hawkes doing the right thing absolutely there has always been a market in india
7126937 in india we buy the fabric and take it to the tailors to have it stitched but in britain it is the other way round it is the bespoke tailoring which is exclusive
7126938 the rich in india have always come to savile row today i would say amitabh bachchan carries his suits well as do abhishek bachchan and john abraham among the bollywood stars
7126939 the company was formed from two famous businesses gieves founded in 1785 and hawkes founded in 1771 since then we have welcomed a passing parade of famous customers whose names would fill a book the magnificent full dress occasions of british state ceremonials have been embellished and enriched by our skills and overseas monarchs and leaders have looked upon gieves amp hawkes to meet their own exacting requirements
7126940 today gieves amp hawkes as the purveyor of quintessential english style dresses individuals who are interested in the rules and references of tradition but who desire to present these in a exciting and contemporary way we continue to represent quality excellence innovation and service of the highest degree

7126944 it is true we have taken over land under the present land acquisition act so theoretically it is tantamount to forcible acquisition

7126961 no liko was like sir can i have another officer here sir can i have a different officer interrogating me
7126962 liko responded very uncomfortable he tensed up he rolled up his window to just a crack to talk to the officer ive never seen liko scared like that before i thought at the time that he was like handling it very well he was like can i have another officer here and mckay was like youre stuck with me
7126963 he told me he was going to his uncles house so there would be witnesses
7126964 actually no the window was open more because we told that guy floyd in the truck to stay there i dont even know why at first he pulled off to the side of the road i was like hey stick around cos i was scared we got rammed
7126965 no it was just pepper spray right away through the open window
7126966 that 4x4 was already there so he should have seen him do that
7126967 yes i said hey sir can you just stay here for a minute i said it through likos window i was like sir they could see me and i saw we had eye to eye communication im pretty sure he heard my voice

7126969 i put this uniform on when i was in the 11th grade and i worked my way up to the national team then the world championship then the olympics
7126970 ive had this opportunity to play with so many players my dream was to hang four gold medals around my neck by the time i finished the olympics here
7126971 im still going to nag her about playing in her fifth one and im very persuasive
7126972 its about passing the torch your legacy starts with the gold medal and lisa has four she earned that shes a major reason why basketball in the u s not just olympics wise not just wnba wise is what it is today
7126973 of course shes going to score of course shes going to get rebounds but its her presence more than anything thats the key we missed her in brazil
7126974 we went from winning the gold medal in athens to finishing third at the world championships and then all the talk was about how the rest of the world has caught up to us that this was the olympics to the get to the u s this was the olympics to knock off the u s
7126975 we werent going to be the team to let lisa lose

7126987 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7126988 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic yeah
7126989 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7126990 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off
7126991 even william hartnell who played the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines i think hell always probably tend to be around 40

7127004 it is considered acceptable to censor sentiments regarded as racist sexist and homophobic
7127005 not at all i was a good friend of davids even before he got the role of the doctor and hes the most delightful chap
7127006 plus theres the fact that we come from the same area of scotland
7127007 id love it if the next doctor who was also scottish
7127008 hed crack up the daleks with a few well timed gags then afterwards they wouldnt be so morose
7127009 they might even come to the conclusion that you dont have to rule the universe to have some fun
7127010 after it was cancelled i fought for years to make executives change their minds so its good to know that i was right all along
7127011 luckily ive had my own wee bit of fan fervour last year i was also in stratford acting opposite ian mckellen in king lear
7127012 loads of doctor who fans came along to watch and get autographs afterwards
7127013 i didnt mind that they still thought of me as a time lord
7127014 it just meant that the doctor was steering people towards shakespeare which is no bad thing
7127015 people who listen to the music might think its sweet but in reality its about people being threatened with torture and execution
7127016 although its set in japan gilbert and sullivan were actually writing about the britain of the victorian era
7127017 we were doing a lot of nasty stuff back then with our empire
7127018 these days you could look at the mikado as a piece about american or russian imperialism
7127019 i decided to do it for a bet me and my school friend danny sweeney bet each other that wed go down and tell the local priest that we wanted to train for the priesthood
7127020 my pal chickened out but out of bravado i went through with it then stayed on for four years
7127021 eventually i decided that i preferred chasing skirt to wearing one
7127022 but it made great training for acting since both involve wearing a great costume and performing in front of a captive audience
7127023 i suppose you could also say doctor who is a religious show
7127024 hes a being from outside our world who is willing to risk his own life to save us all
7127025 i was an actor working at the roundhouse in london at the time
7127026 the rolling stones were playing there so i was asked to work the stage as a bouncer
7127027 this was in the innocent days before violence was invented
7127028 so i just danced about the stage next to the band then went for drinks with them afterwards
7127029 so no one better dive onto the stage during the mikado
7127030 or i really will be using my bouncer training to make sure that a few heads really do roll
7127031 as long as it was great and fantastic then yeah but a film is on for 90 minutes and that is not as important as the series but as long as it doesnt get in the way of the show we could do it
7127032 i would not rule out a film version of doctor who no
7127033 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7127034 shut up just shut up it is easy to find out whats going on with the show we virtually publish the scripts and we film in public
7127035 but in giving things away you become that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7127036 the show is really tough for a superfit david tennant so you might kill somebody who takes on the role in their 60s for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7127037 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40

7127052 could have been an easy win for the democratic ticket i thought obama was smarter than that i guess i was wrong

7127056 sure obamas all about change but you dont get to real change without first understanding how the current system works and how to influence that process in a new direction
7127057 will allay the fears of floating voters who are leaning toward voting obama in november but have concerns over his limited foreign policy experience
7127058 will send shock down the spine of the mccain team which is making foreign policy the centerpiece of its campaign also bidens selection enhances obamas chances of winning in pa and doing well with blue collar voters
7127059 the speaker we heard on that sunny day in newark was the same joe biden that barack obama was thinking of when he made his vice presidential choice this week smart focused clear concise humorous and warmly engaging
7127060 in the face of the flood of cynicism and skepticism that characterizes so many of our views of washington politicians these days biden is one of the very few washington insiders who manages to maintain his constituents faith and hope and trust
7127061 i was waiting to see who obama was going to pick because i thought that would tell a lot about the direction he wanted to take his presidency
7127062 if hes willing to listen to biden hes heading in the right direction i think it really shows strength in his character that hes able to accept a man who really criticized him and to listen to him that says a lot about him
7127063 all of a sudden its not just about history and change and how far weve come since 1968 its about can we really move forward and yeah with that kind of ambition from obama and that kind of perseverance from biden we can do that
7127064 while i have nothing against joe biden i am disgusted and for the first time ever i have no clue who to vote for i know obamas big message is change so he picks a running mate that has been in dc longer than i have been old enough to vote he picked biden because of his experience which sounds logical but how is he going to change with a certified member of old washington on the ticket
7127065 bidens irish catholic working class roots are ones that i can relate to as an hispanic voter i remember sen biden during the gulf war and have always thought he was a straight shooter and very credible statesman sen biden provides the wisdom factor he is truly a senior statesman and his foreign policy experience is very reassuring during these times sen biden more than makes up for all the shortcomings that obama has in my opinion im elated that he has been chosen for vp position this kind of leadership is exactly what the democratic party and our country needs
7127066 obamas choice was a very smart one i have always appreciated joe bidens directness and i feel he gives nice balance to the ticket obama is smart enough to admit that he doesnt know everything and does have weaknesses and he selected someone who has great knowledge in those areas the presidential ticket is now very well rounded and i believe the election has just been won by the democrats also smart move on the announcement the plan was to build anticipation and they certainly succeeded every news channel was standing by for the announcement had me turning on the news as soon as i woke up to hear it kudos
7127067 the greatest charge against john mccain has been that he has been in washington too long to make a difference in the white house with the addition of sen joe biden the obama campaign can no longer make this charge perhaps the greatest problem with his vice presidential selection is that we all know joe biden and weve written him off after several failed attempts at the presidency all that obama has managed to do with this pick is alert the world that john mccain is right he does have a glaring weakness in foreign policy
7127068 i am in week three of my campaign away from my family in a dark and dingy tent in st james square
7127069 when you feel genuine love for someone you must demonstrate that love whether or not you feel they justly deserve it
7127070 americans have gone soft we have become completely and totally dependent on our government we dont know how to take care of ourselves were whining puling stupid weak willed little children wearing big kid clothes

7127076 the two sides discussed possibility of diverting the land to the amarnath shrine board annually for three months construction of pre fabricated structures for the yatra and reconstitution of the shrine board
7127077 this also depends on our and their viewpoints were hopeful of talks progressing towards that end
7127078 my government was reduced to minority following withdrawal of jmm support after deliberations with upa leaders including sonia gandhi and lalu prasad i realized it was also the need of politics in a democratic setup
7127079 we do not want a situation when a player turns selector soon after retirement
7127080 there is virtually no carryover of the existing indica into the indica vista except the good attributes the project cost is around rs 1 700 crore in the various facilities at tata motors and ranjangaon the investment includes the amount for the new indigo also we have taken 3 5 4 years to develop this vehicle and will commence exports only after six months
7127081 there is no question of the project going elsewhere about 85 per cent of the construction is complete and ancillary work is beginning
7127082 then we will tell them how to go about it
7127083 we have asked the ppp to inform us on whether or not the judges will be restored on monday
7127084 the national assembly can pass a resolution monday morning and judges can be reinstated in the evening the same day through an executive order
7127085 unesperienza bellissima in un posto cos strano come la cina
7127086 non lo so era difficile giocare ogni due giorni a quelle temperature e con alcuni problemi logistici che ci sono per noi calciatori abbiamo pagato un po la condizione fisica
7127087 beh era la favorita io pensavo che oltre argentina e brasile anche le africane sarebbero arrivate lontano ed stato cos loro fanno della forza e dellatletismo la loro peculiarit e fanno meno fatica
7127088 non lo so non si pu dire prima bisogner vedere cosa faranno in italia sicuramente sono due giocatori impressionanti
7127089 secondo me s poi dipender da lippi montolivo un campione e avr tutto lanno per dimostrare di meritare la nazionale maggiore
7127090 a chi non piacerebbe per penso che ci siano molti altri davanti a me
7127091 penso di s manca poco alla fine del mercato dovrei rimanere qui
7127092 e vero s non so perch se per volont o problemi di prezzo ma offerte vere e importanti non ci sono state solo voci non ho saputo niente
7127093 io so solo che punto a fare del mio meglio e se dovessero arrivare delle offerte importanti le valuter altrimenti io sto bene qui a brescia
7127094 noi puntiamo a vincere per il campionato cadetto difficile e ci vogliono tante componenti come la fortuna per salire
7127095 non lo so da troppo poco che sono qui sembra che si sia ambientato bene comunque
7127096 sicuramente le tre retrocesse poi bari e mantova che si sono rafforzate molto
7127097 credo molto in alto vista la capacit dei dirigenti e la seriet del progetto sar curioso vedere come si giocher la champions league penso possano lottare contro tutti
7127098 ci sar spazio per tutti viste che si lotta su 3 competizioni
7127099 secondo me dovrebbe essere il titolare ma se domenech ha fatto una scelta del genere vuol dire che era pieno di portieri poi capisco lesasperazione di frey che sperava di giocare
7127100 partite come quelle di oggi sono sempre difficili si rischia di cercare di fare subito il gol e poi si subisce lavversario e ci si espone al contropiede loro si difendevano in dieci e trovare la via della rete non facile quando trovi avversari ben chiusi ecco perch sono molto soddisfatto della prova dei miei ragazzi
7127101 nel primo tempo il bari ha giocato meglio mi ha fatto una notevole impressione e stata una squadra pratica e anche bella a vedersi nel secondo tempo la mia squadra mi piaciuta di pi siamo entrati in campo gagliardi determinati convinti di poter vincere sono contento per il carattere dimostrato nei momenti di difficolt sappiamo saper soffrire e per il secondo tempo che abbiamo fatto vedere ora ci attende lultima settimana di calciomercato non vedo lora che termini questo periodo perch inevitabilmente nella testa dei giocatori il pensiero c spero di recuperare gli infortunati cordova un giocatore che ho avuto a messina e mi piacerebbe riaverlo ma ci sono da valutare alcune cose so che lui ha rifiutato recentemente il grosseto e precedentemente il brescia lascoli non detto comunque che prender cordova perch stiamo valutando diversi giocatori
7127102 ho fatto un bel gol sono contento perch lho cercato con forza deluso dal bari hanno fatto un ottimo primo tempo credo che sar una squadra protagonista di questo torneo personalmente credo di restare in bianconero ho un contratto fino al 2010 se la societ mi far sapere eventualmente che ha ricevuto una offerta importante e vorrebbe cedermi allora se ne potrebbe parlare ho la testa sicuramente solo per lascoli in questo preciso momento
7127103 we consider this as extremely important non violent action taken by tibetans under the leadership of his holiness the dalai lama in a very critical period for tibet particularly the post olympic period
7127104 taken us into war into debt a decline in the economy a mortgage crisis an energy crisis
7127105 there isnt an area of public policy this administration has not failed in
7127106 you have to know the territory so you can work it
7127107 not being around a long time aint a bad thing
7127108 our founders were disrupters martin luther king was a disrupter
7127109 the leverage is no longer going to be with the super rich its going to be with the working class families of this country
7127110 wherever i go in the whole world the thing that makes me the saddest is watching people receive communion in the hand
7127111 what do you think is the worst problem in the world today
7127112 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7127113 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7127114 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7127115 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7127116 support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7127117 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7127118 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7127119 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7127120 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7127121 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security

7127130 theres always a lot of folks particularly those from rural areas playing cornhole at the fair in their spare time this will give even more of an opportunity to take their talents shall we say into organized competition
7127131 who would have thought of such a thing years ago its a sign that the fair is trying to keep up with the times that were living in
7127132 it wasnt one of those quick ones it was a nice ceremony his girlfriend is from out there
7127133 you might not believe this but i dont have one
7127134 even if i dont show it i am so competitive
7127135 i just love competing if i can beat somebody im going to go for it
7127136 im so much more comfortable with the things im doing
7127137 the best advice anybody has given me is to take it one game at a time be relaxed be focused dont be too tense out there there were times last year where i was down and didnt know what to expect im more confident in my ability this year
7127138 its all about the team right now we want to go out and try to win every game
7127139 to be honest were not going to forget it thats always kind of in the backs of our minds
7127140 maybe it will drive us because we dont want to feel like that again two years its tough to swallow when you have two losses like that
7127141 but hes a great athlete hes a special player and were very fortunate to have him here
7127142 im not too worried about who is criticizing me or why theyre criticizing me its not a big deal
7127143 im just trying to be the best quarterback i can be and lead the team
7127144 i try to stay away from that stuff i thought we did pretty well last year we won the big ten and went to the national championship game im not too worried about what anybody is saying

7127157 hace varios a os el ioma puso en manos de farmalink sa y su centro de autorizaciones de medicamentos oncol gicos y tratamientos especiales camoyte el llamado plan meppes que insume el 55 del gasto total por medicamentos ambulatorios y esta es la parte que no quiere poner en discusi n
7127158 son dijo en di logo con hoy m s de 320 millones anuales que seguir n siendo administrados por la industria farmac utica
7127159 ioma tiene una historia de 50 a os en la provincia y siempre con las entidades farmac uticas eso hasta el 8 de julio de este a o cuando nos comunicaron la rescisi n unilateral del convenio hoy este es el nico convenio provincial que la industria farmac utica no gerencia
7127160 surgen por parte de actores interesados que ven perder sus privilegios argumentos difamatorios y maliciosos que faltan a la verdad buscando atemorizar a los afiliados y confundir a la opini n publica
7127161 todas y cada una de las compras de medicamentos que hace ioma est n registradas bajo facturas cumpliendo con las normativas de la provincia de buenos aires como as tambi n cada uno de los expendedores de medicamentos que trabajan con ioma han sido aprobados por el ministerio de salud de provincia y cumplen con las normas establecidas siendo auditados por profesionales del instituto
7127162 ante las injurias y falsedades sobre el ioma y sus autoridades se est estudiando iniciar las acciones legales correspondientes
7127163 la postergaci n de este convenio impide obtener a ioma un ahorro mensual de 17 en un volumen cercano a 40 000 000 siendo este el verdadero objetivo de la campa a que estamos denunciando
7127164 de los 15 millones declarados por el gobierno nacional casi un tercio fue dinero aportado por empresas de salud farmacias y laboratorios estas firmas otorgan cifras a cambio de recibir prebendas y paraguas pol ticos para ampliar sus negociados m s all de los l mites legales
7127165 el nuevo convenio del ioma favorecer a los laboratorios que de por s manejan millones y millones e ir a en detrimento de los afiliados a la obra social si se concreta ser a una acuerdo criminal detr s del que no es dif cil prever que hay un negocio en ciernes
7127166 el acuerdo se har a a favor del gerenciamiento de los laboratorios m s fuertes la consecuencia directa ser a el monopolio de los medicamentos la desaparici n de los gen ricos y la suba indiscriminada de precios

7127172 en el 2004 se ganaron elecciones municipales legislativas y la de gobernador por pocos votos y nosotros podemos ser la comunidad que decida el triunfo electoral en elecciones cerradas nuestra comunidad est llamada a ser la que incline la balanza a favor de tal o cual candidatura no s lo a nivel de senado c mara y alcald as sino hasta de la propia gobernaci n
7127173 pero tenemos que elegir funcionarios uno a uno es decir por candidatura eso es un voto m s inteligente y controla el arrastre porque muchos de los legisladores que tenemos ahora han sido arrastrados por los partidos y no necesariamente salieron electos los mejores
7127174 no existen datos espec ficos de cu n grande es la comunidad dominicana pero entiendo que deben ser alrededor de 300 000 los dominicanos residentes en puerto rico de los que votan tampoco tenemos un n mero exacto porque la comisi n estatal de elecciones no discrimina por nacionalidad pero los que est n capacitados para votar son alrededor de 100 000

7127178 epidemiologic evidence suggests that complications of diabetes begin early in the progression from normal glucose tolerance to frank diabetes

7127180 the most ive ever won in my career is 15 and its nice to get there
7127181 but im not going to get complacent im not finished trying to accomplish what were trying to do here its great its a nice feeling to have but at the same time theres a long way to go and a lot of starts left
7127182 i think thats been a good approach so far one game at a time
7127183 hes dedicated hes got good stuff hes on a little bit of a mission
7127184 the mission is to win baseball games and help this team win and get himself a nice contract next year which he deserves

7127186 its not a two man show or three man show its a bunch of guys in the lineup who are capable of getting it done

7127190 you never know whats going to be effective you have to do what you can one of the things that we can do is stand out here and let them know that a celebration of the naqba is not going to go unchallenged
7127191 people dont realize that the biggest money in the entire world budget for foreign aid goes to israel
7127192 and most of it goes to arms its being done in our name the exploitation of the palestinians is the same as the exploitation of the people in the community i live in in detroit
7127193 it makes me proud of them these are the people who have conscience
7127194 no but for a good story idea ill polish whatever you got

7127203 half way i could only dream of meeting god half way
7127204 my vehicle sometimes wants to do its own thing and veers off do you have a vehicle that i could use
7127205 my dream was to have four gold medals around my neck by the time we finished our last game here in beijing
7127206 thats what usa basketball is all about passing the torch
7127207 your legacy of course starts with gold medals lisa has four no one can ever take that away from her
7127208 shes a major reason why basketball in the u s not just olympic wise but wnba wise is what it is today
7127209 i knew i had to come out and play very physical jump start our team so i tried to come out and be aggressive and let our team know i was there ready to fight the fight for us
7127210 i was really thinking more about candace and sylvia those are the babies and just the fact i felt good about what i was able to do to contribute as a leader in helping them
7127211 sylvia did the running hook that i just showed her five days ago candace got her chance to get out there and cross people over and get to the basket and thats what its about passing the torch
7127212 weve only been together for one month but ive never seen a team so unselfish in a short period of time
7127213 thats what really scared me about coming back to play with a younger group i was i hope theyre not about themselves and thinking about points and all that and i could not have been more wrong about what these young ladies were about
7127214 it was all about team for every minute every second and thats what made us successful
7127215 we appreciate everything theyve done to get us this far but i can definitely see us taking it to the next level
7127216 next year is going to be a make or break year in terms of survival
7127217 any help like these government loans would be a huge boost
7127218 our plans which require significant investments are at risk because of limited access to capital
7127219 this program will open capital that is necessary to make sure our transformational plans continue at full speed and give us the best chance to succeed
7127220 the priority is to get the appropriation that has already been approved
7127221 conversations as to why or how we should expand that amount are ongoing
7127222 our auto companies are rising to the challenge building the next generation of american cars but are doing so in times when credit conditions cripple the funding for the facilities and technologies to take the steps to the future
7127223 we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7127224 this is a horrible idea another transfer of funds to failed ventures
7127225 if this were a good idea the market would price the debt accordingly and give them the money
7127226 weve seen these kinds of bailouts for the financial companies why not the automakers
7127227 i like the way he handles a broad range of subjects in an engaging and friendly manner definitely one of the good guys
7127228 right wing blogging from a uk student a fresh perspective on a plethora of events with a healthy interest in shelf stacking to boot
7127229 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
7127230 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
7127231 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth
7127232 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7127233 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7127234 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7127235 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7127236 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7127237 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7127238 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7127239 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7127240 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7127241 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7127242 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7127243 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7127244 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7127245 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7127246 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7127247 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7127248 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7127249 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7127250 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7127251 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7127252 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7127253 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7127254 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7127255 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7127256 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7127257 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7127258 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7127259 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7127260 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7127261 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7127262 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7127263 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7127264 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7127265 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7127266 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7127267 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7127268 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7127269 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7127270 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7127271 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7127272 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7127273 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7127274 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7127275 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7127276 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7127277 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7127278 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7127279 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7127280 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7127281 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7127282 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7127283 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7127284 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7127285 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7127286 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7127287 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7127288 signs are emerging that history is repeating itself in the big easy still healing from katrina people have forgotten a lesson from four decades ago and believe once again that the federal government is constructing a levee system they can prosper behind in a yearlong review of levee work here the associated press has tracked a pattern of public misperception political jockeying and legal fighting along with economic and engineering miscalculations since katrina that threaten to make new orleans the scene of another devastating flood
7127289 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7127290 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7127291 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7127292 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7127293 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7127319 now that the situation has changed in iraq they are going to a new front and thats afghanistan
7127320 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7127321 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7127322 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7127323 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7127324 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7127325 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7127326 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7127327 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7127328 who are open to doing something on the production side
7127329 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7127330 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7127331 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7127332 he has respect for mccain but hell be the first to angered by the sort of cheap shots theyre throwing at obama now
7127333 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7127334 call in joe biden and john kerry and zbigniew brzezinski and carl levin and like minded republicans
7127335 they actually have a long and good relationship theyre friends
7127336 mccain was much in demand for overseas escort duty he was fun to be around his wit appealing his natural exuberance infectious in an athens taverna he danced on a table with senator joseph bidens wife jill a red bandanna clenched in his teeth
7127337 you know i mean thank god for john mccain in saying whoa what are you guys talking about
7127338 no daylight between john mccain and george bush they are joined at the hip
7127339 a man i greatly admire a man i consider a personal and close friend
7127340 more than a great soldier its going to require a wise leader
7127341 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7127342 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7127343 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7127344 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7127345 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7127346 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7127347 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7127348 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7127349 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7127350 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7127351 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7127352 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7127353 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7127354 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7127355 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7127356 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7127357 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7127358 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7127359 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7127360 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7127361 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7127362 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk

7127407 i believe that joe biden is an excellent choice he is a man of experience and high integrity he will be a valuable running mate to senator obama

7127423 el rafael era obviamente de tecnolog a avanzada no era como todas las naves de pax que de soya hab a visto anteriormente un derivado de modelos de la hegemon a parec a demasiado delgada para el vac o y demasiado complicada para la atm sfera pero creaba la impresi n general de ser una m quina mort fera y aerodin mica el casco un compuesto de aleaciones flexibles y zonas de energ a pura permit a r pidos cambios de forma y funci n que habr an sido imposibles unos a os antes mientras la lanzadera se acercaba al rafael en un lento y largo arco bal stico el exterior de la nave pas del cromo plateado a un negro opaco e invisible al mismo tiempo el liso casco central devor botalones de instrumentos y habit culos dejando s lo ampollas con armamentos y sondas de campo de contenci n o bien la nave estaba realizando chequeos para trasladarse fuera del sistema o bien los oficiales sab an que la lanzadera tra a al nuevo comandante estaban alardeando un poco
7127424 antes que el crucero desapareciera en la negrura de soya not que las esferas de los motores de fusi n se arracimaban como perlas alrededor del eje central en vez de concentrarse en un solo c mulo como en su vieja nave antorcha el baltasar tambi n not que el motor gede n hexagonal era mucho m s peque o en esta nave que en el prototipo rafael antes que la nave se volviera invisible atin a ver las luces de los habit culos trasl cidos y la clara c pula de la cubierta de mando por las lecturas que hab a hecho en pacem y las inyecciones de instrucciones arn que le hab an dado en la jefatura de la flota de soya sab a que esas zonas claras pod an generar epidermis blindadas m s gruesas pero l disfrutaba del paisaje y preferir a esa ventana hacia el espacio

7127429 im not running for president to be somebody but to do something im running to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things im running for president to protect our country from harm and defeat its enemies im running for president to make the government do its job not your job im not running to leave our biggest problems to an unluckier generation of leaders but to fix them now and fix them well

7127432 well be the one to tell how much it is
7127433 we are looking forward to upgrading the 3g battery packs to last for five hours and we are expecting to see the results by next year
7127434 i think hes really the smart choice because he brings a balance to the ticket in terms of experience that i think will attract a lot of voters i met biden during the caucus and i wasnt that excited to meet biden i didnt really know him but i came out of the meeting so engaged i was really surprised at what a masterful campaigner he is its a really balanced ticket a perfect ticket now because you have a visionary paired with a masterful policy maker he adds depth and he will help us attract undecided voters people say he undermined the message of change but the thing about joe biden is hes very direct he has a reputation for being honest and i just think people will find the two of them together to be unstoppable
7127435 biden is an excellent choice as he was probably the most qualified of the 17 candidates starting out he brings a depth that will balance a ticket and account for perceived shortcomings of obama
7127436 more capable of making a mistake in the fall campaign than obama is
7127437 picking a consummate insider seems to be going completely against the theme of change
7127438 overall i think its probably one of the best choices obama could have made
7127439 it obviously shows that sen obama believes that he needs to strengthen his foreign policy credentials and i think biden can do that if theres a contrast there thats interesting or ironic obama has positioned himself rather effectively so far as the change agent candidate the candidate who will bring change to washington and he picks somebody whos served in the united states senate longer than sen mccain in some regard it takes that messaging away from him a little bit i think hillary clinton would have been an effective pick for sen obama to unite the party ultimately this is still a mccain vs obama campaign it almost always comes down to the people at the top of the ticket
7127440 i think its a solid pick i think its very complimentary to what obama brings to table to have someone with foreign and domestic policy experience biden really rounds out the ticket i think having that experience and that long view is really critical the fact that he has been a part of all the major foreign policy issues the u s has been involved with in the last 25 years the fact that he understands issues in eastern europe and the caucasus having been involved with the kosovo issue and former yugoslavia involved in iraq and critical of the war bolsters the foreign policy credibility the ticket has hes a very engaging person who listens very well hes compatible to what barack obamas all about it bodes for a strong effective relationship once elected overall hes a straight talker and when we hear politicians talk about straight talk its refreshing to have someone that can be so frank thats what we need
7127441 im so excited i think that its going to bring a lot of people back on board biden has the best foreign policy experience you can get hes going to bring a lot of women who were disappointed in hillary not getting the nomination back in the game i think its going to make a huge difference in nevada ive had people calling me telling me they were going to vote for obama but now theyre actually going to campaign for him this takes all of mccains advantages away if anyone can stand up to mccain its joe biden i think it says a lot about obama it shows that obama is willing to surround himself with the best and its not about his ego because joe biden will tell him how it is and what he thinks he wont hold back
7127442 i think in many ways this was a choice driven by vladimir putin the russian prime minister the invasion of georgia and the challenge to nato and the united states by the russians highlighted the need to offset sen obamas lack of foreign policy experience so you can add that biden brings 35 years of deep expertise on international issues but the choice was a compromise given that biden is the ultimate washington insider that obama has been campaigning against
7127443 i lived in delaware from 1955 to 1964 when i moved to reno i worked for jack kennedy in that state i met joe biden and worked with joe biden i think that he will be an excellent running mate and they will work well together and it will be for the advantage of the united states of america
7127444 wont just make a good vice president he will make a great vice president
7127445 he is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7127446 this man is a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7127447 the times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
7127448 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7127449 he punches me first and his friend who has nothing to do with it punches me
7127450 one of the stupidest things i ever did in my life
7127451 dear brother we are sorry to hear it and to counteract the evil we will open the window and give the children fresh air
7127452 thank god i shall never go back to that any more
7127453 i know what solomon has said but he found it out by his own personal experience and i should like to do the same
7127454 today is a special day we hope its the beginning we have opened the path and we hope there will be more travellers
7127455 in order to avoid a well publicised provocation in the middle of the sea
7127456 because we know who is on the boats and what they contain we will allow them to land
7127457 the arrival of the two ships after this adventure represents a big breakthrough in the wall of the israeli siege imposed on gaza
7127458 the journey was long and hard we had a lot of rough weather out of cyprus a lot of people got sick but it was worth it
7127459 the beginning of an end to the siege only if other organisations and friendly countries allow people to sail towards gaza
7127460 this hurts like hell youre going to rip the whole muscle in two yknow see if you could go take a crap somewhere
7127461 we will be seeking more specific information about why he was picked up and held and about his experience during his incarceration
7127462 we have done a thorough investigation and were confident the restaurant is not the source
7127463 our goal is to provide a healthcare system that offers and balances both availability and value

7127472 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7127473 we are doing this because we believe there is a lot of untapped information here in afghanistan
7127474 we are using the rewards for justice programme to facilitate the finding the whereabouts of these people but also the leadership of these kind of organisations
7127475 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7127476 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly
7127477 we were still very low very close to the ground
7127478 and then the wind shifted and i felt how the smoke was burning me
7127479 well jerry we just have a super group of guys on the
7127480 i thought we was gonna run out of gas there at the end but i got a nice push from my teammate jerry jeff jeeter mcpheeter racin in the peter jacksons king kong the official game of the movie number 14
7127481 under none of the scenarios was it contemplated that the government would taking this subsidy into account make a net profit from taking northern rock into the public sector
7127482 ministers considered that this share of the returns was disproportionate to the share of risk borne by the taxpayer or in other words the private provider would receive an excessive return relative to the risk taken
7127483 the value of the additional equity will be reflected in the sale price for northern rock on return to the private sector
7127484 i ring my contacts and theyre all in abu dhabi
7127485 these are the guys the sovereign wealth funds want to work with guys so far off the radar they make the hedge funds look transparent
7127486 people say we are in a downturn like the early 1990s
7127487 i think its going to be worse than that were in for something like the 1970s or even the 1930s
7127488 greenspan was part of a new political culture that started in the 1990s and violated the integrity of his predecessor paul volcker
7127489 feel good politicians like bill clinton and tony blair started telling people only what they wanted to hear
7127490 stoking up the economy on debt was a way for the west to sustain an unsustainable standard of living
7127491 in this sense the financial system wasnt the cause of the problems it was the messenger
7127492 if the chinese wont revalue it the us needs to talk about import tariffs
7127493 regulatory reform proper incentives for bankers these are valid issues
7127494 the root cause of financial market excesses on both the upside and downside of the cycle is collective human behaviour unbridled optimism on the upside and fear bordering on panic on the downside
7127495 to think that the us will not come back is short sighted we are building in the us while competition there is weak
7127496 i dont think it will be too bad the stock market is down about 20 maybe it needs to go down by 30 40 and there could be one more shock a large european company could fail but my instinct is for a market upturn by the end of the year
7127497 the final tally will depend in large measure on us house prices and the broader stabilisation of the credit markets
7127498 the mpc needs to respond to recessionary not inflationary expectations
7127499 people are worrying about a replay of the wage price spiral
7127500 but that happened 30 years ago and the economy has moved on
7127501 i would be astonished and horrified if the government accepted the tucs advice
7127502 a winter of discontent would ensure they get what they dont want
7127503 many people in the west are full of fear now
7127504 how you deal with the coming changes say half the general motors assembly line moving to china will determine where the downturn comes out
7127505 how much has the west spent on the iraq war
7127506 three trillion dollars bush may have thought he was getting a new source of oil for that money but has he
7127507 the us election is the most important thing happening this autumn a barack obama victory would signal a new beginning to the world
7127508 baugur believes they have a solution to woolworths problems on the table but they need to talk it through with the company they are keen to do something
7127509 the process is going well and when we get a candidate signed off we will announce it
7127510 with inflation running high the middle ground members of the mpc appear unlikely to vote to reduce rates unless market expectations for a cut are widespread
7127511 but downside risks to already downbeat views on activity continue to build and we continue to expect rates to begin to fall later this year
7127512 if we get to a point where weve simply saturated the audience so they expect world records to be broken in every race or every heat we may be desensitized
7127513 in certain sports fairness is skewed by science and swimming is one of them
7127514 we used to think that there must be a limit to world records but now we understand that its a philosophical question
7127515 in any sport you can look at the size and physique of the athletes now compared to a few years ago and you simply see body types have changed
7127516 prevent the significant loss of energy through the joints in the foot
7127517 the best doctors the best trainers and the best medical equipment
7127518 you can see the possibility that a potential buyer would not regard baa as disinterested as it will be competing with the new owners of the airports
7127519 its not just the competition commission there is a weight of public opinion behind this
7127520 a buyer with no experience of owning and operating airports is not going to qualify
7127521 there are well advanced plans for heathrow and stansted i dont think it is possible to execute either of them faster but it is possible to slow them down
7127522 while we think upside potential is attractive for current shareholders to turn a buyer would require a leap of faith not acceptable in this environment perception of financial stability will be key to any prolonged share price recovery and this is unlikely to be achieved in the short term
7127523 nothing really has changed here or default rates are still low and showing no signs of increasing and our funding percentages havent been altered at all

7127532 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france
7127533 they want to keep these checkpoints as we know but they have no legal basis for it
7127534 until now the us supported russias integration in the world community we have admitted russia to the group of eight and we have saluted and encouraged its wish to join the wto
7127535 our position is that they should pull out to the sixth of august positions
7127536 if israel chooses to forcibly stop and search our ships we will not forcibly resist
7127537 if we are arrested and brought to israel we will protest and prosecute our kidnapping in the appropriate forums it is our purpose to show the power that ordinary citizens have when they organise to stand against injustice

7127543 the us embassy in el salvador never countered this absurd threat or clarified the impossibility of such legislation being passed
7127544 ultimately such intervention helped turn a close race for the presidency into a decisive victory for the right wing nationalist republican alliance arena party
7127545 mr glazer arrived with the idea of attacking our delegation and rudely countering everything we put forward to the point of being verbally abusive to at least two of the delegates
7127546 whether or not the ambassador agrees with the concerns we laid out about us intervention he has a duty as a public official to hear us out in a respectful manner
7127547 if this is how we as us citizens are treated we can only imagine how the ambassador interacts with salvadorans we hope that in the future the state department will better orient its representatives about how to dialogue with those holding a differing opinion
7127548 in 2007 the iri headed by republican presidential candidate john mccain presented president saca with its freedom award showing its clear ideological preference in the polarized salvadoran political process
7127549 the presence of partisan groups like the iri and ndi may in fact be counterproductive to the goal of the salvadoran people which is to hold free and fair elections in 2009

7127580 we have to create awareness that homophobia is not acceptable
7127581 its a gimmick a token effort to do with a very serious problem
7127582 its essentially signs and stickers what we need is more police and if they dont have the resources council should provide money to employ security guards
7127583 more education in anything doesnt go astray but we need both awareness and more police
7127584 we need more police presence and safety measures not just putting a label on it

7127604 it was probably the best pitch i threw all day
7127605 it was the only ball that was down he did a good job of hitting it

7127623 this is a formidable ticket and a risky ticket and not a comfort zone choice for obama criticism will focus on bidens 1987 plagiarism bout his support of credit card companies he pushed the bankruptcy bill that dems now hate his comments about obama his racial obliviousness

7127640 i think john mccain would be a great candidate for vice president

7127642 theres too much partisanship in america and theres too much partisanship in the senate

7127732 a falta de acesso a esses exames pelos pobres e conveniados nos entristece porque passa a imagem de que somos privilegiados porque poucas pessoas podem fazer isso

7127738 i get comfort from carrying my rosary going to mass every sunday its my time alone
7127739 i ts obviously not a good thing that these quotes are out there im just saying they could be much much worse given that biden and obama were rivals for the presidency just a few months ago
7127740 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7127741 when i said this mccain opposed bushs tax policies didnt plan to keep u s troops in iraq for 100 years wanted the republican party platform to be less extreme on abortion rights supported affirmative action and rejected the religious right mccain has since reversed course on all of those issues i liked the old mccain a lot better than the new one
7127742 pay off your damn 250 000 credit card bill and then well talk about whos in debt to the credit card companies
7127743 that referred to the old mccain but here is how hes changed since then
7127744 this is not the john mccain i used to know
7127745 get to the back of the bus and wait your turn these things take time im going to effect this change thing with an old white male club member
7127746 there he goes again forgetting things he forgot to include the total comment
7127747 there is just so much for john to remember houses cars timetables that i guess he just needs his rest
7127748 joe biden is practically the acknowledged foreign policy expert in the united states senate hes stared down dictators all around the world you know hes got decades of experience in washington and yet you know uniquely hes not of washington he goes home to his family in delaware every single night hes rooted in the middle class hes the voice of cops and firefighters all around the world i mean he is the perfect person that you could find to try to make the fundamental change to get away from the failed policies of the bush administration and he is an independent thinker joe biden as you well know has never been at a loss for words hes an expert on many many subjects both foreign policy and domestic policy you know and hes going to be a tremendous asset in helping barack obama govern this country and get away from the failed policies of the past
7127749 the obama campaign wanted no drama with their picks and thats why when you actually look at the final five people on the short list all five of them had very little drama about them but all of them did have some drama really except biden with kathleen sebelius you would have had some clinton drama well geez you pick kathleen sebelius why didnt you pick the other woman that was out there that couldve been obvious with sam nunn his drama couldve been his stance on gay rights and it wouldve been even a one day story where a lot of gay rights groups wouldve been upset obama wouldve had to come out and say no no no heres my stance on these gay issues but that isnt a topic they would want to discuss in the first 48 hours after their pick with evan bayh the drama is who is evan bayh there wasnt you know it wasnt clear what he brought outside of potentially his state which is electorally potentially important but there wasnt a big issue there wasnt this one thing you felt like okay this is the resum gap that biden fills and with virginia governor tim kaine of course there wasnt personal drama thered have been this experience issue and it wouldve been like what karl rove said two weeks ago the least experienced ticket in the history of presidential politics so when you start to look at the obama campaigns short list the guy that created the least amount of drama for obama was joe biden

7127801 don bradmans test average 99 94 runs per dismissal is entrenched in australian folklore and the story of the dons final innings out for a duck when just four runs would have taken his average to 100 has been told countless times
7127802 just four runs spread over a career of almost 20 years and more than 197 hours at the crease it is worth asking just how sure can we be that the number is correct
7127803 as it happens my recent research has shown that it could be wrong a tantalising clue to four missing runs has been found
7127804 in the scorebook of the epic eight day fifth test of 1928 29 against england in melbourne won by australia by five wickets there is a
7127805 the relevant sections of bill fergusons original score are illustrated there are four runs attributed to ryder that are in the wrong place in both the batting section of the score and in the bowling section there is no doubt that a recording error has occurred so whom do these runs belong to

7127819 the additional money was to be raised through a further commitment by government of 6 billion including 2 2 billion from the national lottery of which 675 million was extra funding the revised costs were driven by several factors including the rising price of land remediation the increased allocation to contingency tax the imposition of vat and the rising costs of security to address this cost problem government and the mayor of london committed in november 2007 to the sale of park land post 2012 to offset any deficits that might arise from the event not covering its costs

7127856 is that he was not afraid of controversy or conflict he was a combative player and he was the same way when he fought for the players
7127857 but he also was a visionary that too is his legacy he was smart enough to recognize that if you make progress at someone elses expense that can come back and haunt you if you get a deal that is so sweet it leaves others wanting what have you really accomplished you have to leave something on the table
7127858 i would never leave until this new deal is done

7127916 the kingdom of heaven is upon you now think about what that means
7127917 for one short time for awhile you i were joined to eternity but now were split in two back to me and you like the rain rising from the sea
7127918 somethings wrong with me i feel sick all the time
7127919 if youre sick the cards wont tell which part of it is physical and which part is just down to all the stress you said you were having last time as far as theyre concerned its all one thing if youre sick you need to find out as much as you can about why before you come here asking
7127920 i mean im not going to ask about why i just want to know what i can do about all the stress whether its physical or not i need to figure out what to do about that come on its
7127921 you should know by now that you cant just sit back and let stress ride you it just confuses everything see a doctor and then well talk about where you go from there
7127922 you know if i see you today ill have to charge you extra
7127923 you ought to wait a week 50 if you wait 75 if you dont my advice would be to wait
7127924 you knew it would happen and you explained to me exactly how you would handle it when it did its too soon to be trying to look into the next stage give it a month to finish happening and well talk then about what you need to do next
7127925 im not a witch im a priestess of sorts and in any case christ himself was accused of sorcery
7127926 people dont understand what i do at all if they think im a witch of some sort anyway witchcraft was an invention of the medieaval church to stamp out gnosticism in southern france
7127927 the dagger queen is a woman who has suffered a loss
7127928 shes someone with a specific sort of experience in her past getting remarried doesnt change who youve become as a result of the things that have already happened
7127929 be sure that you articulate your question as clearly as you can try to mentally state the outcome that you want or fear and the result you are seeking if you have a particular expectation acknowledge it ask if events are currently pointing in that direction ask what you can do or change to bring it about pray that youll have the insight to see the response and the courage to face the truth its important to do all of this before we start if youre vague about what youre asking you wont understand the answer when you get it tell me when youre ready to begin but dont tell me your question unless i ask
7127930 youd better believe it is look at these cards do something else
7127931 thats the answer and it is very specific you need to find something to do youre stuck this is a big change from last time when it looked as if you had too much going on now for some reason youve ground to a halt no wonder youre sick look at these cards youre standing in your own way at every turn ive never seen such a set of metaphors for spiritual and mental constipation look here heres the ghosts again right here at the first turn at the basis of the entire problem whats that doing back in the picture and youve got that influence crossing and countering the influence of the staves angel no wonder you feel stressed you cant get started on anything new if youre dealing with all of this unacknowledged bullshit what in the world is going on here are you having a lot of panic attacks
7127932 okay well take the panic attacks as read look at the cards at the third and fourth turnings expectations and external factors youve got the seven grails countering the shining child so youre so afraid theres something wrong with your health that you probably cant bring yourself to do anything about it youre expecting the worst your external factors are the winged horse countered by the eight daggers the problems not in the environment there are plenty of indications that you could move forward and be productive if you wanted to but youre not i wonder why
7127933 at the sixth and seventh turnings the trend and the probable outcome youre still in a holding pattern here at the 6th youve got the lector countering the three staves so thats your creative drive being stifled by some sort of fear of censure or of authority here at the seventh youve got the magus and the five staves every single pair shows your energy being blocked and all of the blockages are coming from inside you not outside you and right here at the fifth i can see from the pairing of the dagger guardian and the staves guardian what the cause is anger and anxiety locked together theyre change cards both of them but nothings going to change if the guardians arent moving forward youve got to prise them apart and put them back on the path what are you so afraid of
7127934 i always am nowadays i feel like everythings just out of control
7127935 whats that about never mind dont answer i dont need to know the only thing i can really tell you right now is this youve got to find some sort of way to unblock all that energy
7127936 and i really dont think im going to have any more to add till youre out of your holding pattern nothing i say would be a bit of use anyway i dont have even an inkling of what happens next it looks like youre trying to make sure that
7127937 you say i need to do something i dont even understand what you mean
7127938 i dont know what and i dont know if it matters
7127939 listen if you feel youre not in control of your life youre right you cant control it but you can be in it digging in your oar and at least affecting the direction you cant control it but you can affect it if you do anything at all thats probably enough to get you moving forward again well the alternative is for you to hold still and let yourself be moved along and that would probably be okay too the problem is that youre trying not to move at all that isnt going to work damozel
7127940 cams cooking hed like to see you he said so before you got here
7127941 if you bring forth what is within you what is within you will save you if you do not bring forth what is within you what is within you will destroy you
7127942 yes thats actually exactly what i was trying to say back there
7127943 kelowna has a bunny problem and unfortunately they waited too long and the things multiplied until it became a real issue
7127944 it is going to be interesting to see if the elected council can learn from the city on the east side where they went wrong so we wont be facing the same path they chose to take
7127945 they brought back three bunnies onto cameron road which is our neighbourhood the children went back and the bunnies stayed
7127946 essentially theyd like that area to join city of kelowna and they want the city to do a study of the tax impact the city had previously reviewed such a submission and decided they didnt want to do a study at that point the city learned the province wont provide funding for a study so theyd be on their own
7127947 are you in favour of the city doing a study on the chance of joining kelowna
7127948 he felt the normal way of doing this sort of petition was to go door to door to get a larger number of signatures
7127949 it will take about three hours to do the repairs and during that time about 300 people will be without power
7127950 none of us really had an opportunity to build soap box racers as kids so we are doing it now
7127951 we are trying to make it as stable as possible so it wont tip over no matter how fast we go or what we may crash into thankfully the course is padded with hay bales
7127952 our whole theme is we want to make a penguin fly so if you can imagine a penguin on his stomach with his flippers out stretched and a cape around his neck trying desperately to fly thats what our box will look like
7127953 we still have to get the chassis figured out and get a good steering and brake system going before we build the frame then we will cover the frame with a mold exterior of a penguin hopefully once its all airbrushed itll look pretty good and will run well
7127954 registration runs from 9 a m to 10 30 a m our 3 km dog walk begins at 10 30 a m with our 1 km furry scurry following right on its tail at 11 a m
7127955 the merchant mall will give you an opportunity to shop with many products and services on display from local vendors as well as the spca store with many bcspca products for sale
7127956 weve re branded our company so we thought it would be neat to give the artist community an outlet to paint
7127957 a lot of these people especially the graffiti artists dont really have anywhere to paint in the city so we thought this would be a great outlet for them as you can see we have kids and all sorts of people taking a stab at it
7127958 not at all we respect that the city is trying to get rid of graffiti but its not going to stop someone from being an artist and wanting to be an artist so this is a legal and safe way to do whatever you want on the side of a truck
7127959 ive always wanted to get some nozzles and try it out but i havent done any in spray paint this is the first one
7127960 it will take about three hours to do the repairs and during that time about 300 people will be without power

7127971 every time i hear wendy speak i learn something new not just about cape wind but about politics in america she embodies the best of this countrys journalistic tradition reminding us all why a free press is so critical to a free society
7127972 i loved the way you framed the issue as being primarily about democracy rather then clean energy i think that is a critical point that has been left out of this debate
7127973 enough political intrigue to keep a john grisham fan happy
7127974 a ripe subject populated with the sort of people who would be among the first to count themselves as friends of the earth but the last to accept an environmentally friendly energy source if it meant the slightest cloud on their ocean views
7127975 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7127976 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now

7127984 working with one of slovenias most advanced bi and data warehousing consultancies crmt zm started this project with more than six months of extensive testing
7127985 im so glad matt won im glad that a non chinese person won it breaks the mind barrier to know the chinese are beatable
7127986 its like a four minute mile once one person did it lots of people then did it afterwards its now possible for a british person to win in london 2012 i need to go away learn some harder dives perfect them and then hopefully all goes to plan in london
7127987 there were three goals when we came out here was tom happy and proud of his performance job done did he learn as much as possible he could probably go away and write a book on the subject and did he have fun
7127988 hes a boy whos going to have a lot of trouble if he is not left alone
7127989 actually im quite looking forward to going back to school and just seeing my friends
7127990 it was tough i wasnt ready it was too much for me to handle and i just lost it
7127991 the crowd got to me and i didnt have time to get a strategy i was glad the decision was reversed but im still upset that i didnt have time to prepare properly i should have been in the final
7127992 we can prepare for the competition but not for that sort of stress
7127993 the day was a downer for me and its changed my opinion of my sport
7127994 repr sente les meilleures traditions pour la vice pr sidence en s lectionnant un leader fort exp riment et un homme enti rement d vou au service du pays

7127996 youre going to find something wrong with somebody because in our nature in our human aspects its hard to believe that someone can be perfect
7127997 how amazing and physically talented that guy was to win the 100 like he did
7127998 now people have a problem with the way he celebrated and its mainly the people that cant run
7127999 we are very far ahead of where we were last year
7128000 i hope that shows up when we start playing the regular season
7128001 like coach always preaches to us its the past weve got to move on because if you keep thinking about it youre not going to do well in the future
7128002 you also understand what they have done in the past doesnt really stand for a whole lot right now
7128003 with what we did last year i dont think we can live and dwell off that because that was last year
7128004 for us to have a whole offseason and training camp under our belts to really understand the offense is scary
7128005 i am nervous because there is really no telling what we are going to do the bar is set high
7128006 but the thing that i think is so representative of what these guys have done is when the games on the line they make plays
7128007 they have the ability to make the plays when they count and brady has always done that he makes them all the time but particularly when the games on the line
7128008 they might say it is suspicious and maybe i might say to them come and see our programme come down and see our testing come down and see how we operate any time day or night we have nothing to hide
7128009 i first saw usain when he was 12 running 52 flat for 400 metres on the grass
7128010 he just loved to run he is never going to leave jamaica he is setting an example to young children that there is something different from crime and we dont worry about bolt and drugs no sir
7128011 i have always loved the 200 metres i wanted to go for this record i blew my mind and i blew the worlds mind

7128029 there are things we work on that need work and we correct them we try to improve on them the next day and then add things if we have them in then good and we move on to something else if we need more time on them then we try to tune those up before we move on to something else that is the way it always is just a normal camp
7128030 shawns under everyones wing im still under vrabels wing still under adalius wing
7128031 i like the camaraderie around here especially in the locker room and on the field they have a great group of guys in the locker room i think that is all you can ask for coach belichick understands football and understands his players he puts us together as one and we come together as a team
7128032 in ways we are very far ahead of where we were last year
7128033 we know what we can do its not about getting lined up in the formation and running the play now its about getting into a better play if the play we called in the huddle isnt the one we like the best when we line up on the field those guys can adjust because they know the signals and routes
7128034 separation wall which is nothing but a means for enlarging the settlements as even the israeli supreme court now admits

7128048 i do think it is highly unlikely that i would be called upon to serve in that office were i to be pulled like cincinnatus from my plough then obviously you know it would be an absolute privilege to serve
7128049 there is no doubt he believes he could do it he is a superb tactician boris is aware that the conservatives have been out of the limelight for too many years on the global stage and this will mean people around the world seeing him as the no 1 tory in britain

7128056 theyre a good side very well organised we didnt pass it as well as we could have in the first half
7128057 they play one way and its very effective we put a team out to try and pass it better it didnt work first half but we improved in the second half
7128058 shays save was like scoring a goal it gave us some momentum the cross from geremi was superb and michael was fishing around for a goal and he did
7128059 our coaching staff is pleased to be reuniting with michael

7128061 in making this trade we certainly respect the toronto leadership for acknowledging michael had been placed in a very difficult situation via the kerry joseph deal athletically they hated to see him go but both adam rita and rich stubler expressed a desire to be fair to michael given the many contributions he made to their club in that regard its important to remember toronto went 11 1 with michael as their starter in 2007
7128062 so long as the people do not care to exercise their freedom those who wish to tyrannize will do so for tyrants are active and ardent and will devote themselves in the name of any number of gods religious and otherwise to put shackles upon sleeping men
7128063 it is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in this place which you have dishonored by your contempt of all virtue and defiled by your practice of every vice ye are a factious crew and enemies to all good government ye are a pack of mercenary wretches and would like esau sell your country for a mess of pottage and like judas betray your god for a few pieces of money
7128064 never never never believe any war will be smooth and easy or that anyone who embarks on the strange voyage can measure the tides and hurricanes he will encounter the statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events
7128065 we will be issuing court proceedings in september unless there is an acknowledgement by the police that there was a breach of human rights
7128066 that would be enough to stop us filing the papers which are being prepared but we have not had a substantive reply to a letter we sent to the force in may
7128067 this is not about money but the principle and i am confident that we will win on behalf of mr cunningham and mr abraham
7128068 con algunos prejuicios sobre que se hacen monjas las chicas menos atractivas
7128069 fight for good jobs that let people live their dreams a tax code that rewards work instead of wealth and health care that is affordable and accessible for every american family
7128070 forge a new energy policy that frees us from our dependence on foreign oil and 4 gasoline at the pump while creating new jobs and new industry
7128071 put an end to a failed foreign policy thats based on bluster and bad judgment so that we renew americas security and standing in the world
7128072 we know what were going to get from the other side
7128073 four more years of the same out of touch policies that created an economic disaster at home and a disastrous foreign policy abroad four more years of the same divisive politics that is all about tearing people down instead of lifting this country up
7128074 now with joe biden at my side i am confident that we can take this country in a new direction
7128075 we are ready to overcome the adversity of the last eight years
7128076 well restore that fair shot at your dreams that is at the core of who joe biden and i are as people and what america is as a nation
7128077 freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one
7128078 in all things of nature there is something of the marvelous
7128079 i was happy with bronze in the 1000 and its such a privilege these guys are that good
7128080 im extremely stoked im more happy with yesterday now i didnt want to get too excited before this race
7128081 through training in the past month we did a massive block and i knew that ken was capable of something quite special
7128082 i always felt through his career that kenny had this x factor mentally and he had the big show in him
7128083 it was whoever produced it on the day and he really nailed it he really did
7128084 yeah i was at a lunch in beijing given by the australian prime minister and there was marius
7128085 we gave each other a firm handshake and then had a cordial discussion rather conscious that there were a lot of people watching us
7128086 just that the bulk of where synergies would come from would be the superior positions rio tinto has in those areas where synergies can be created
7128087 if you take the roadmap of established processes and procedures it could take until the end of the year
7128088 ive said from the very beginning it will be a long process we have a strong set of businesses great capabilities strong macro
7128089 bhp had a bad time in the latter 1990s after a series of bad investments bad strategic directions and a lot of value destruction and youve got to give their previous chief executive chip goodyear credit for recovering from that but the early part of this decade was sort of a trough point so if you want to compare performance you pick that trough point
7128090 the company is energised by this we havent been out there trying to present ourselves publicly before weve got a new head office weve refined the brand weve been very open and employees like seeing themselves being talked about
7128091 one of the challenges when you are enjoying strong margins is focusing on cost reduction and improvement i dont want to see anyone working on their golf game just focusing on safety performance cost and delivering growth targets
7128092 toms got great technical skills real presence hes ambitious and hes someone you could trust with your chequebook
7128093 some 80 to 90 of all profits in this industry will be from the top 40 ore bodies
7128094 and the strategy is very simple get as many of them as you can discover them or buy them
7128095 we dont go out drinking with each other but we have a healthy level of professional respect
7128096 the bhp offer was taken seriously considered on the basis of value and rejected on that basis its just a focus on value you know youre only going to get the same old phonograph from me
7128097 ive got a group of 10 senior executives who report to me i spend two thirds of my time on internal business the rest is shareholders journalists and other stakeholders
7128098 three out of five nights last week i was sleeping on planes
7128099 i am on the road a lot so i love reading
7128100 what has been done until now has been pretty well done itseems to me under those very difficult circumstances
7128101 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and willrequire serious efforts to overcome it
7128102 the stimulus helped to support consumption in the middlepart of this year
7128103 one of the things well be experiencinglater this year is the withdrawal of that effect leading toeconomic weakness
7128104 that is a very graphic analogy with aids understanding wonderfully while being strictly speaking wrong in every possible way
7128105 you are correct but you must admit its an interesting question not to know the answer to
7128106 its been a blessing for me to be out on this court
7128107 when you put on this jersey you know the tradition thats expected
7128108 they dont hope you live up to it they expect you to live up to it and thats winning the gold medal
7128109 i cant explain what it feels like to have a lot of pressure on you as a team and theres so many players on our team who deserve this
7128110 we knew this was lisas last game tonight was a perfect example of how were 12 strong
7128111 kara has always been that ball of energy coming off the bench
7128112 this team preached how one through 12 were deep and were all here for a reason and its just we need to wait our turn for when we were going to be important for this team
7128113 and kara she came out and really set the tone for us and she was the reason why we were able to dominate this game
7128114 every single year when we get together it sort of gets better and better to have all 12 of us buy into a system so fast in just six weeks together and every single game it seemed like we got better and better im hoping i can make the next one to keep the streak going
7128115 hvorfor siger i underkop det er jo ikke nogen kop men en tallerken
7128116 your search french military victories did not match any documents did you mean french military defeats
7128117 in our society today we face a lot of health issues
7128118 estamos conseguindo por fazer um campeonato muito bom mas quando empatamos um jogo fora de casa ava e perdemos do vila nova alguns j queriam saber o que aconteceria ser perd ssemos o pr ximo
7128119 estamos saindo de uma rodada com o resultado fora de casa mantivemos a diferen a em rela o ao ava e abrimos vantagem para o quinto colocado que a nossa primeira satisfa o na competi o
7128120 eu estou compreensivelmente desapontado com a sess o de classifica o porque eu tinha outras esperan as para hoje s bado
7128121 o everton ainda nosso jogador e pode voltar ao elenco mas cedo para a gente ter alguma posi o concreta sobre isso pois ainda vamos conversar com o atleta para analisar novamente essa situa o
7128122 muito bom que tenha alcan ado tal vit ria pois isto lhe dar ainda mais for as para chegar aqui e trabalhar com maior confian a em suas qualidades e demonstrar suas virtudes em um benfica cada vez melhor
7128123 o talento demonstrado foi o mesmo que no passado o levou a traz lo para o clube
7128124 foi incrivelmente frustrante esse dia para n s n o fomos capazes de encontrar o equil brio do carro nos treinos da manh o que atrapalhou a nossa prepara o para a classifica o
7128125 eu n o acho que ele esteja focado o suficiente ele senti que n o seria boa a sua presen a nos vesti rios
7128126 n o h nada para esconder no outro dia n s falamos com ele como disse ramos e ele n o estava nas condi es certas para atuar essa a situa o todos sabem disso e n o h nada que possamos fazer
7128127 quando a gente estava bem dever amos ter matado o jogo no futebol voc tem sempre que respeitar tivemos oportunidades na frente mas ficamos tocando a bola de um lado para o outro o futebol n o permite isso e o jogo acabou endurecendo em determinados momentos n s criamos preju zos para n s mesmos
7128128 t nhamos que ter matado logo o advers rio pois 2 a 0 um resultado perigoso o crb continuou vivo depois que fez seu gol mas conseguimos conter
7128129 depois de ouvirmos as explica es de ambos decidimos n o tomar nenhuma a o
7128130 eu n o pude acreditar fui fechado por glock e na hora lembrei que aconteceu o mesmo comigo em budapeste
7128131 eu e a bel fomos muito felizes e espero sinceramente que isso motive outras meninas
7128132 a vela j tinha uma hist ria de tradi o nos esportes ol mpicos como a maior vencedora dentre todas as modalidades por causa das medalhas dos homens agora mostramos que as mulheres tamb m podem
7128133 mudou a sensa o de que imposs vel conseguimos quebrar esse tabu planejamos uma campanha investimos e conseguimos colocar em pr tica tudo aquilo que t nhamos pensado ainda fechamos com chave de ouro ganhando a regata da medalha
7128134 n o nada f cil ser atleta ol mpica n o para qualquer uma
7128135 a vela tem seu valor como esporte ol mpico e a medalha ajudou a justificar todas as nossas solicita es em termos dos recursos que s o necess rios para se fazer uma boa campanha ol mpica
7128136 eu faria outra campanha mas ainda n o conversamos s rio sobre isso
7128137 se as duas est o com 100 de vontade se teremos recursos para fazer outra campanha s ria temos de encarar a vela como algo profissional como trabalho
7128138 o botafogo vive uma grande fase mas n o nenhum bicho pap o muito menos imbat vel isso n o existe eles est o bem e a gente tamb m
7128139 contra o internacional e o palmeiras tamb m foi assim muitos disseram que a gente ia sofrer uma goleada que o vasco ia ser atropelado mas n o foi isso que aconteceu no futebol n o adianta falar nada antes de a bola come ar a rolar as coisas s o resolvidas dentro de campo em 90 minutos
7128140 apesar de todos os problemas n o tenho m goa de ningu m o torcedor reage quando vai embora um jogador que eles n o querem que saia mas eu agrade o ao botafogo por ser sido o primeiro grande clube a me dar uma chance

7128166 i do not regard our national debt as unduly alarming
7128167 weve overcome things far worse than what is going on right now
7128168 what concerns me more than anything is our savings rate
7128169 the problem is getting the public understanding and the political will to do something about it
7128170 i do not regard our national debt as unduly alarming
7128171 weve overcome things far worse than what is going on right now
7128172 what concerns me more than anything is our savings rate
7128173 the problem is getting the public understanding and the political will to do something about it
7128174 if the ets fails to pass in this parliament national is widely optimistic to suggest it could pass its own legislation within nine months of taking office
7128175 thus nationals jockeying over the bill for short term political advantage at home will come at a very high cost of long term disadvantage for those crucial two sectors ag and forestry internationally
7128176 run on the bank people who are withdrawing funds could receive too high a payment because properties are evaluated higher than they should be this would be unfair to those who remain with the fund
7128177 the individual investor would do well to avoid using any filter rule and i might add any broker who recommends it
7128178 unhappily the signals generated by the dow mechanism have no significance for predicting future price movements
7128179 it is clear that if there are exceptional financial managers they are very rare and there is no way of telling in advance who they will be
7128180 the individual investor would do well to avoid using any filter rule and i might add any broker who recommends it
7128181 unhappily the signals generated by the dow mechanism have no significance for predicting future price movements
7128182 furthermore an investor who proposes to ignore near term market fluctuations needs greater resources for safety
7128183 so that youre protected against any extraordinary mistake an individual fund might make you buy shares in the mutual funds directly from the funds themselves
7128184 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7128185 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
7128186 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time
7128187 the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother
7128188 these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
7128189 shes got the physique the music to us at 52 shes an inspiration to go on

7128191 shes got the physique the music to us at 52 shes an inspiration to go on

7128196 alright class may i have your attention we have a transferred student today and her name is yoshizawa hitomi please be nice to her
7128197 just call me yossie and the thing i hate the most is annoying people so dont bug me or ask any silly questions when its not needed
7128198 didnt i just say not to ask silly question and to answer your question its because i hate skirts
7128199 ok class settle down yossie please take a seat next to ishikawa rika shes sitting next to the window first row fourth seat
7128200 we heard that youre a talented detective and can break any case without a sweat in tokyo theres this ishikawa gang that has been smuggling in illegal cocaine and weapons and they made money through any illegal means
7128201 its easy to say that but we dont have any evidence everytime we sent spies they always end up missing or being killed so we want you to take this case
7128202 well if i say that this case is related to your sisters death
7128203 your sister died in a car accident however a witness saw ishikawa crews in that car so they might be involved with your sisters death
7128204 even though ishikawa kazuko is a dangerous man but he has a daughter named rika and he loves her a lot she goes to an all school girl named gakuhou high school we want you to get close to her and if you have a chance then investigate her father
7128205 ill accept this case but i dont want to wear a skirt
7128206 dont worry about that we can ask a permission for you to wear pants by the way change your name to hitomi to hide your idenity
7128207 so thats rika behind a scary father theres a cute daughter how ironic
7128208 hmph you were lucky but this time i guess not
7128209 sensei why dont you become a karate master instead of a teacher
7128210 how dare you on your first day to fall asleep in class and even talked back to me i guess you have some guts yoshizawa no one in this school is dare enough to confront me except you
7128211 phew lucky its lunch time even though my karate is beyond a black belt but i wouldnt want to face her wrath dang her glare really scared the shit out of me
7128212 who is this girl ive never seen her before maybe shes a transferred student but shes really handsome and she has pants too
7128213 out of the way cant you see rika sama is here idiot
7128214 erika we have to teach these idiots a lesson not to get in way
7128215 even though you have a pretty face but deep down inside is rotten who do you think you are making everyone to get out of your way
7128216 who am i is none of your business even my father wouldnt dare to lecture me that
7128217 then ill teach you in place of your father i dont give a damn about your father spoiled you but if you bully people then ill stick my nose in it
7128218 really next time you should stand up against them bullies are coward once you fight against them
7128219 its ok im used to it she has a strong father behind no one dares to slap her like that
7128220 thats why you didnt know about rikas strong background avoid her next time when you see her im going back to my classroom thank you for saving me and im sorry for putting you in danger she might not leave you alone
7128221 dont worry about that and remember to treat your injuries
7128222 wow when did everyone leave so fast just then i saw a crowd and now theres no single soul here well except my soul
7128223 locally grown readers choice summer potato salad with purslane and chorizo
7128224 locally grown readers choices shrimp with three herb pesto over toasted israeli couscous
7128225 this is going to be a major change no matter how it comes out
7128226 the fact of an african american winning a major partys nomination is unprecedented its a difficult position to be in but so far hes been treading very carefully and i think successfully
7128227 i dont think i know he wants to be elected because hes a good president who happens to be black not because hes black and would like to be president
7128228 after a primary like this theres always more time needed to unify the party
7128229 but obamas going to win the nomination and hes going to make a hell of a speech
7128230 when i hear obama talking about change and a new direction it brings back to me some parallels
7128231 it was part of this whole momentum of moving forward of moving beyond
7128232 i think he has a very tough campaign ahead of him because a lot of ideas about race are very subliminal
7128233 what will they do when they get in the voting booth i dont think anybody really knows yet
7128234 theirs is going to be about history and ours is going to be about the future
7128235 obamas biggest problem is to recapture the excitement about the time he was in minneapolis in february when he was coming on strong
7128236 i think hes better off to just hammer on issues people really do care about it like jobs and the economy
7128237 in the end voters and black voters are more focused on making sure that someone who has their best interests in mind will win rather than voting for the first black president

7128259 ayumi paused she didnt know how to complete the sentence actually she didnt even know what she wanted to drive at with this conversation
7128260 rika chan did you and yocchan did you two have sex
7128261 how come ayaka and mai said you smelled like her room

7128288 i am responsible for it i alone am responsible for it and it led to this most recent incident at the beverly hilton i was at the beverly hilton i was there for a very simple reason because i was trying to keep this mistake that i had made from becoming public

7128294 now that im on the other side im seeing the other side the sacrifices that police make what im trying to do is bring the two sides together we need to work with the police not against them they feel resented they dont get respect theyre scared
7128295 maybe mine will fly to nanas house because we want her to get better too
7128296 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the ceasefire agreement
7128297 insisted it was important that russian troops present at the poti senaki area should withdraw as soon as possible
7128298 why do they want to take control of poti maybe they want to grab poti from us while we are still alive we will not allow them to stay here
7128299 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7128300 we will be seeking more specific information about why he was picked up and held and about his experience during his incarceration
7128301 where i am going you cannot follow now but you will follow later
7128302 lord why cant i follow you now i will lay down my life for you
7128303 will you really lay down your life for me i tell you the truth before the rooster crows you will disown me three times
7128304 i am ruined for i am a man of unclean lips and i live among a people of unclean lips and my eyes have seen the king the lord almighty
7128305 see this has touched your lips your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for
7128306 whom shall i send and who will go for us
7128307 maybe i will be fit for england but manchester united come first
7128308 i have felt it the tendinitis for the past 16 months but hopefully i will be back playing in a week or two
7128309 physically i demand a lot of myself i wish it wasnt the case but i just have to cope with it
7128310 obviously i am trying to get better i do a bit more every day
7128311 last season i was fit towards the end that is the reason the boss brought me here
7128312 obviously there is a big season ahead for manchester united and england and i want to be fit and available
7128313 ive said before we suffered on the counter attack when other teams play a 9 1 formation if you score a goal it changes completely

7128315 il y a du grabuge en perspective parce que le capitalisme et les capitalistes fran ais sont en train de craquer ce quil leur faudrait cest une bonne vieille r volution

7128320 et pour ces lections a dit le postier de neuilly il ne sera pas question de se faire satelliser par les socialistes fran ais ou europ ens nous nous battrons avec courage sans mollesse sans concessions la conviction est dans notre camp
7128321 a ceux qui disent que nous faisons le jeu de la droite je veux parler de cette gauche institutionnelle moi je r ponds que cette gauche ne fait m me plus son travail normal dopposition
7128322 cette gauche l se trouve toujours mille excuses pour ne pas faire son boulot elle ferait mieux de surveiller la droite plut t que de cr er des commissions pour surveiller la lcr

7128328 im not saying what dave williams is accused of doing is a normal operation but it does happen
7128329 must be sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victims employment and create an abusive working environment
7128330 in granting the employers motion for summary judgment the district court determined that gavin failed to make a prima facie case that her working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign
7128331 genuine issues of material fact as to both the hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims
7128332 nas l oluyor ki bu kadar yoldan sonra dinlenmeden devam etmek istiyorsunuz
7128333 el sistema es el mismo todo es discrecional tanto sea en trigo tanto sea en carne tanto sea en leche
7128334 si todo es una mentira c mo quiere que haya alg n tipo de confianza
7128335 m s que una provocaci n parece una alcahueter a una b squeda de m ritos
7128336 no tenemos nada demasiado importante contra guillermo moreno como persona y como funcionario ac el problema es la ratificaci n de la pol tica es mucho m s importante haber escuchado a la presidenta cristina fern ndez que har a todo de nuevo que remuevan o no a un funcionario
7128337 ni siquiera nos hizo mover el amper metro que sacaran a alberto fern ndez o al ministro de econom a mart n lousteau o al secretario de agricultura javier de urquiza
7128338 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7128339 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7128340 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7128341 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7128342 support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7128343 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7128344 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7128345 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7128346 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7128347 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security
7128348 as far as wingnuts go dana is pretty goddamn well grounded
7128349 aw dont be dissin dana for a wingnut hes not half bad
7128350 sh t i like dana more than i like jesurgislac and dana is near pathological in his desire to throw people in jail hes a messed up monkey but i still feel his humanity despite some of the missing parts
7128351 a week without common sense political thought was making me feel lower than a snakes belly in a wagon rut
7128352 dana troglodyte misogynist obsessive a complete loser every time i pick on him no matter how nasty a person he is i feel bad because he is after all a loser
7128353 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased
7128354 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue

7128360 nasa is very disappointed in this failure but has directed its focus on protecting public safety and conducting a comprehensive investigation to identify the root cause
7128361 nasa is assembling a multidiscipline team along with the rockets maker alliant techsystems of salt lake city to begin the investigation promptly
7128362 the hypersonic boundary layer data that they were trying to acquire
7128363 we flew a trajectory that anybody else stays away from the dynamic pressures were sixfold of what space vehicles normally see
7128364 but we were quite interested in the data that were going to be obtained for future developments
7128365 we dont know exactly what data if any were actually acquired that will be of use for us
7128366 on the basis of the results of analyzing that data we will make a determination as to if this needs to be tried again or not
7128367 canadians will like the fact that both of them are opposed to the war in iraq
7128368 theyll like the fact that theyre both knowledgeable about world affairs theyll like that obama and biden will take a multinational approach and not an our way or the highway approach to international issues
7128369 the idea that we are not willing to take the prime minister of canada and the president of mexico to the mat to make this agreement work is just a lack of presidential leadership
7128370 certainly obama and biden will take a more aggressive approach to increasing fuel efficiency for automobiles thatll be tough on the auto industry but they can do it and generally they favour a more aggressive approach on environmental regulation
7128371 so right at the top of the ticket you have someone who brings significant expertise in areas that concern canadians
7128372 it makes your knee feel very unstable its something that ive been trying to deal with hoping it would get better by now
7128373 ill try to do it as fast as possible so we can make this less of a distraction
7128374 my thing is just to keep preparing and get ready for opening week
7128375 every day it just didnt feel right or it would feel worse
7128376 one day it would feel like it got a little better and id go back out there and its still sore thats one of the things ive dealt with
7128377 i am not diana the film is not about diana
7128378 the two were related by ancestry and united by destiny
7128379 there is absolutely no reason to have done this trailer which is a bad joke
7128380 the marketing people probably thought the only way they could get the young popcorn eating brigade to see this film was if they made some comparison with diana but they did not need to and should not have done it
7128381 we didnt want to make any parallels between the two women whatsoever
7128382 it didnt govern the shooting of the film or the performances
7128383 trailers should be what the film is about but in this case the trailer is not connected to the film
7128384 i dont actually think that georgiana died in a carriage crash
7128385 fueron interceptados por un grupo de personas que obligaron a bajarse y efectuaron disparos de escopeta tres de los cuales impactaron el parabrisa y el parachoques
7128386 dispararon al bus obligando a bajar a la gente y el bus qued con toda la parte frontal da ada y el parabrisas quebrado
7128387 seg n informaciones extraoficiales que tenemos al parecer al interior de la comunidad existen visiones distintas de como manifestar las demandas mapuches
7128388 ive seen a lot of development in one year with the changeup especially
7128389 i thought tonight was the best hes pitched all year
7128390 he was locating his fastball and keeping changeups down while mixing in the curveball
7128391 i think hes capable of striking out 200 or more every year
7128392 the closest ive gotten was in college when i had 199 its a big number its cool
7128393 the curveball was solid and he threw a lot of good changeups but they did not miss a single mistake in the fourth inning
7128394 bengie molina hit it well and the home run was the death blow
7128395 trabalh mos ao m ximo para desgastar o palmeiras tavira tentei uma duas tr s quatro vezes mas o david est muito forte e n o teve qualquer momento de fraqueza

7128397 i dont think there was an american around that didnt see it on tv or have some kind of impact from what had happened
7128398 i was there that day and of course its a day where everybody remembers where they were we lost five guys in my fire house
7128399 its a great combination of the three events tied by tragedy
7128400 who would ever think that people would be touching it its like the arc of the covenant its unbelievable
7128401 its still this important to people and i think thats just great it shows the true american spirit

7128405 biden es conocido como un charlat n por su tendencia a formular declaraciones que lo meten en camisa de once varas
7128406 la elecci n de biden subraya ciertas debilidades que la campa a de obama busca corregir en momentos en que los sondeos muestras que su competici n con el senador republicano john mccain se torna m s disputada
7128407 algunas canas que pueden hacer parecer algo joven a obama
7128408 para una campa a que se enorgullece de su disciplina en materia de comunicaci n la opci n de biden incorpora al equipo un elemento fuerte de incertidumbre
7128409 excelente orador pero criticado como verborr gico y que a menudo se ve perjudicado por sus propias declaraciones
7128410 biden pas el viernes en su casa con su familia y amigos el habitualmente locuaz senador mantuvo un perfil bajo
7128411 estamos comprometidos para mejorar la manera en que respondemos a las preocupaciones y a las cr ticas sobre el fondo

7128415 obviamente a pergunta mais importante esta pessoa est pronta para ser presidente
7128416 a segunda quest o mais importante pelo menos de minha perspectiva esta pessoa pode me ajudar a governar
7128417 esta pessoa ser um colaborador eficaz para a cria o de oportunidades econ micas aqui no pa s e para nos guiar em algumas situa es internacionais perigosas
7128418 o terceiro crit rio que usei foi a independ ncia eu quero algu m que desafiar minha forma de pensar e n o apenas que concordar com tudo quando se trata de optar por esta ou aquela pol tica
7128419 it feels great to be back in the tournament where i did really well last year
7128420 i was really close to the title and i had some exhausting matches but this is where i think i felt really confident after that i started believing more that i can win a grand slam title which i did this year
7128421 as a grand slam winner you get some kind of relief and you get motivation to claim even more titles
7128422 i think this surface and the balls and all the conditions here in new york are suitable to my style of the game and to my personality and everything
7128423 so if i feel well physically i think i hope i can get far
7128424 the last couple of weeks for me were really exhausting
7128425 i had to travel all over the world because i went from cincinnati i went back home and then went to beijing and then came here everything in 10 days you can imagine how i feel
7128426 i feel excited about the tournament but physically i still need to work on some things hopefully so that by tuesday wednesday i can be fit
7128427 i dont think im a clear favourite when im playing next to these two guys
7128428 i never have been because theyre of course the first two players in the world next to me there are a lot of players like
7128429 but i just want to play the best tennis i can and results will show up

7128437 entiendo que hay acuerdos de colaboraci n entre las autoridades federales estatales y municipales pero es un mazacote en mi opini n no veo un marco legal para permitir que un polic a ministerial investigue el narcomenudeo a menos que participe un agente federal lo que aparentemente estar a sucediendo

7128440 hacemos un trabajo muy esforzado para llegar al mayor nivel de convicci n respecto de este fen meno en guanajuato con evidencias como este patr n en guanajuato se practica la tortura
7128441 utilizar esta herramienta nos vuelve a una realidad que no podemos dejar de ver una polic a incapaz de enfrentar t cnica y cient ficamente su responsabilidad tortura nunca m s puede ser muy medi tico hay quienes dicen que si es para garantizar la seguridad est bien claro mientras no se cometa tortura con nuestros amigos o familiares pero si la autorizamos para unos la autorizamos para todos y no habr qui n nos salve cuando estemos en esa situaci n

7128445 i do it on my free time because i think i owe my community some respect
7128446 it makes me feel good knowing i could help out
7128447 every church and organization should be doing this because there are so many boys and girls that dont receive anything
7128448 to know that these men and women are being taken care of gods using little people to do a great thing and this is fun
7128449 i walk out and i thought well no one saw that except my mom who tuned in to c span
7128450 my phone rings my cell phone its at night and its joe biden like three minutes after i finished the speech and hes saying that was a great speech good work hes just someone who is a very positive guy
7128451 minnesota will love joe biden when they get to know him i can just see him up on the iron range right now he has blue collar roots hes a very warm person
7128452 barack obama wanted to pick someone as hes always said that wasnt a yes man he wanted to pick someone who would challenge him to be a better president and joe biden will do that
7128453 it had just broke we had no idea what bridge it was and i was going to leave to go see what it was and he said you better go home now
7128454 hes just always sort of looking out for people and thinking about other people and you can see that in how hes gotten along with people so well in the senate
7128455 sen obama has once again shown his outstanding judgment in selecting sen joe biden as his vice presidential nominee
7128456 they share the same vision for america and together they will turn the economy around ease the burden on families and finally end the war in iraq

7128488 i always have ice on my shoulder as a preventative thing
7128489 but it happened to be that night where everyones like oh he has ice on his shoulder if they look at me every night i have ice on my shoulder
7128490 it was just one of those scares just like anything if someone pulls their hamstring and all of a sudden you feel a little something you want to be cautious
7128491 it was one of those things like any time you had a previous injury
7128492 it just caught me wrong and i was like oh jeez a twinge you look at it and you say thank god it wasnt worse it was one of those things where it just kind of scared me

7128501 the refusal to believe in anything you cant see yourself is absurd
7128502 if the project an eu olympic team seems ambitious the concept is rather easy to understand at every international sports competition we realise that if the european countries medals were counted together the european union would have a much stronger weight in the traditional medals list and would be able to really compete with the usa china or russia
7128503 its also a way to combat nationalism that is always very fast in spreading on these sportive occasions which is often a pity since the spirit of sports and fair competition should be promoting tolerance mutual respect and intercultural understanding
7128504 the young european federalists really do need to grow up
7128505 britains amazing athletes have shown us how britain can be one of the best in sport
7128506 the german french italian and dutch teams have all done well too it is frankly bonkers to claim that all our countries athletes would do better if they were put into one team and made to compete under an eu flag
7128507 why on earth is the eu commission lavishing taxpayers money on these euro federalists to come up with nutty ideas like this

7128531 i shall be concerned to develop a conception of mathematical intuition that is in a general way kantian
7128532 it is hard to see what could make a cognitive relation to objects intuition of count as intuition if not some analogy with perception
7128533 it is hard to maintain that the case is the same for mathematical objects are there any experiences we can appeal to in the mathematical cases that are anywhere near as indisputed as my present experience of seeing the computer screen

7128541 graham cracker crust is a bit too homey and definitely too sweet for me
7128542 its authentic and it provides a bit of crunch that contrasts with the texture of the custard filling
7128543 the graham cracker crust has a flavor of its own

7128549 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly

7128552 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
7128553 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7128554 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
7128555 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
7128556 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7128557 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7128558 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position

7128571 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it

7128594 how do you figure you cant prove that anything is 65 million years old none of the dating methods work you cant use the geological column because to make that work you have to use circular reasoning again a failure
7128595 we can only 100 date something and thats through history and we can only go back 4000 or so years with that
7128596 so to pull up 65 million year old dino bones and still have soft tissue in them is ludicrous

7128967 the precepts are guidelines leading to the goal of liberation set up by the buddha to use guidelines to obstruct the goal of the practice runs counter to the spirit of the buddhas intent we should not let guidelines block the buddhas purpose
7128968 other religions see buddhism as misogynistic and backwards 300 million buddhist women world wide are waiting for the monks to bring buddhism into the 21st century
7128969 the buddha allowed women access to arhatship to sagehood we who deny women ordination are obstructing the spiritual progress of half the human population this is an offense and should not be honored to do so diminishes the stature of the buddhist religion in the eyes of the world

7128985 heres the driveway if the pontiff is a bit rich for your budget over here is the eremite thats our economy model much smaller and a bit austere granted but there are a lot of empty confessionals out there if you fast and wear sandals the eremite will increase your piety and as they say father your mileage may differ ha ha ha little joke
7128986 our lady of grace does have a basketball team as i recall you might consider our prayer bus model with powerful motor monks they come standard or as the deluxe package you can choose the option of vegetarian monks which reduces toxic emissions and with every model youll find the catalytic conversion ratio increases after eucharist one psalter takes you to la and back weve experimented with a variety of fuels old father peter was famous for his taize chanting that bus would sail along father reginald was an anchorite thats another story
7128987 no the other faiths havent had as much success the lutherans reformed our design but their first model kept backfiring i heard that the universalist unitarians built a car without doors there was an altar in the back seat and you held a ritual and then decided that there was no point in going anywhere the evangelicals put a car into production but it didnt sell many units because there was only one way to go
7128988 step over here to my office father and lets make a deal
7128989 the lord mayors car is still not in sight can you keep the mantra going another ten minutes
7128990 no way monks dont race dragon boats we dont race we meditate we even retreat what could be slower
7128991 we wont race we bless we dot the eyes relax its a ceremony
7128992 but i dont know how to dot dragon eyes suppose we do it wrong suppose the boat sinks what if dragons hold grudges did you think of that
7128993 wheeet dont seek bodhi afar spatz wisdom pop compassion crackle your own mind
7128994 for your birthday chris may its songs never replace the music in your heart
7128995 what is the best practice for me what should i do to move forward in my spiritual practice
7128996 what is the best practice for me what should i do to move forward in my spiritual practice
7128997 i wish i was rich and if i were i would give all the street children food clothes medicine shelter and love and affection
7128998 the conference brought together mahayana theravada and vajrayana practitioners and scholars both sangha and laity
7128999 focus on the politics of it and you have about a quarter of clinton loyalists still not joining the caravan for gods sake not to even make a show of taking her seriously is flatly stupid
7129000 they thought her supporters were mad before they are really mad now
7129001 i think there are a lot of hillary voters who are going to say hey wait a minute man you said you were going to put her on the short list
7129002 you cant just put your fingertips on the pad you really have to push it we explained all this directly after the race to cavic and his coach
7129003 to see all the people from the neighbourhood getting together and being able to organize this it has been amazing
7129004 right around the table i had people from germany venezuela peru mali senegal
7129005 i was born in haiti so the world is right around this table this is the reality of quebec this is the reality of the world right now
7129006 or whether or not the government needs a new mandate
7129007 bitter cup that will be proferred to us again and again
7129008 he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7129009 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7129010 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7129011 no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have
7129012 support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7129013 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7129014 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7129015 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7129016 thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7129017 of course senator biden is comfortable on the attack he spent the entire primary highlighting barack obamas inexperience and failed judgment on national security
7129018 the damage from fay is a reminder that a tropical storm does not have to reach a hurricane level to be dangerous and cause significant damage
7129019 even if there was a law such as having a big red flashing light attached to paedophiles homes i guarantee that would not protect every child
7129020 we know that during the afternoon ahmed and a group of friends were on the top floor of the block of flats they saw the group of six youths approach the estate on bikes at that point they decided to leave ahmed had become separated from his friends who went to the third floor
7129021 ahmed remained at the top and it seems that one or more of the group made their way up to ahmed and he has been so scared he has made his way out of the balcony to shin down the outside of the flat
7129022 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7129023 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic yeah
7129024 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7129025 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off
7129026 who do you want answering the call at 3 am
7129027 there are already several new improved versions of the kindle in the works
7129028 improved interface operating controls this has been an issue with some buyers
7129029 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7129030 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7129031 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7129032 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7129033 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7129034 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7129035 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7129036 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7129037 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7129038 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7129039 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7129040 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7129041 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7129042 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7129043 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7129044 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7129045 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7129046 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7129047 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7129048 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7129049 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7129050 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7129051 obviously it got out of control but to be honest i thought i was in a safe house
7129052 i thought i was part of a community that handled its problems internally and that recognized the dangers of exposing ourselves no pun intended to the rest of the country
7129053 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7129054 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7129055 it just happened so fast i didnt have time to react i wasnt even able to hit my brakes or anything what stopped the forward motion of the car is that i ran into a big bear
7129056 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7129057 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7129058 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe

7129061 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7129062 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7129063 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7129064 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7129065 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7129066 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7129067 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7129068 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7129069 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7129070 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7129071 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7129072 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7129073 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

7129077 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano

7129085 hes goes home on the train eats dinner with his family hes the epitome of a regular guy
7129086 for decades has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7129087 by selecting joe biden for vice president barack obama has shown voters that not even governor tim kaine can hide the fact that he is out of touch with the core values held by the hard working families of virginia virginians deserve a president and a vice president who understand that we need a comprehensive solution to the energy crisis lower taxes for virginias families and who have a record on strong national security what virginia doesnt want is an inexperienced presidential ticket that will raise taxes on families and industries that are most important to virginias economy john mccain believes in lower taxes energy solutions and a stronger national security voters in virginia will support john mccain for president because they always know where he stands
7129088 barack obama has sent virginia voters the message by choosing senator joe biden as his running mate that he just wasnt seeing the momentum in virginia that he had hoped barack obama spent two full days campaigning in virginia and his message is not resonating there is no question in the minds of voters that he will raise taxes on virginia families ignore the energy crisis and continue to support retreat and surrender in iraq voters in virginia will support john mccain because he is a proven leader and ready to be commander in chief on day one he believes in lower taxes for virginia families and has an all of the above plan to solve our energy crisis i am proud to help john mccain to victory in virginia in november
7129089 at long last the speculation about who senator barack obama would choose as his running mate is over i congratulate senator biden on being selected to run with senator obama in november however it is obvious that senator biden will do nothing to help senator obamas chances of winning in virginia i remain convinced that virginia will vote for john mccain he is the only candidate who has the background knowledge and experience to lead our country at a critical time in our history and he is the only candidate who has put forth positive solutions on important issues such as national security economic security and energy security i look forward to campaigning with senator mccain to victory here in virginia this november
7129090 i presume he was sucked down into it and he was overcome by the rush of waters
7129091 i doubt well see any flooding out here the wind is starting to sting a little but thats about it
7129092 this wont be much at all if a storm doesnt have a category in front of it doesnt worry us much
7129093 the flooding is definitely something that we are monitoring and tracking and he was down there to see what kind of handle he could get on that
7129094 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7129095 had starred in a hollywood movie without permission from iranian authorities
7129096 iranian movie stars must obtain permission from the culture ministry before appearing in foreign movies
7129097 golshifteh found out about the ban at the airport where she was to travel to hollywood to examine a new offer
7129098 precisely because of the films scenario the relationship between the two main actors the scenes the narration everything is against what the regime stands for
7129099 i want to leave this country this violent country this country where there is no freedom for women where it gives no chances to people like ali to perform to play no other chance but became drug addict like ali
7129100 as the news of golshiftehs travel ban spread iranians using their mobiles telephones expressed their dismay shock disappointment and anger against the authorities particularly both the fanatic president and his culture and islamic minister a former hard line journalist
7129101 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7129102 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7129103 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7129104 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7129105 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7129106 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7129107 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7129108 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7129109 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7129110 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7129111 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo

7129113 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7129114 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

7129126 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7129127 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7129128 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7129129 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7129130 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7129131 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7129132 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7129133 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7129134 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7129135 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7129136 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7129137 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7129138 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7129139 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7129140 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7129141 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7129142 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7129143 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7129144 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7129145 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7129146 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7129147 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7129148 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7129149 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7129150 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7129151 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7129152 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7129153 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7129154 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7129155 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7129156 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7129157 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7129158 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7129159 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7129160 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7129161 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7129162 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7129163 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7129164 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7129165 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7129166 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7129167 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7129177 the last holy week as it does every year saw different scenes around the nation
7129178 covertly set they up hidden cams and baits inside dark and murky caverns on the island which are now called

7129180 global trends are moving towards advertising online rather than traditional media
7129181 the next step in that evolution is to advertise on mobile handsets providing rich targeted content to the customer
7129182 what makes this platform so unique is the fact that customers can choose to download the software and view the advertising
7129183 as the eyeballs paybacks accumulate they can either have automatic loading of airtime as they reach a certain total or they can choose to be sent a pin on request free airtime can also then be transferred to a sibling child or anyone else they choose
7129184 we also believe that our customers should be rewarded for telling their friends about us our invite a friend program will allow our users to receive additional eyeballs paybacks for those friends they have referred to us
7129185 eyeballs mobile allows advertisers to determine exactly which customers they would like to target with their advertisements and our metrics allow us to report on the exact profile of the people who have viewed the advertisements
7129186 this will minimise wastage and assist in customising advertising messages for specific target audiences
7129187 as a user you get the choice to download the software view the advertisements and collect rewards or not
7129188 and while we believe the combination of rich content and rewards will be reason enough for our customers to use this platform there will be random cash prizes up for grabs during the launch month
7129189 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7129190 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7129191 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7129192 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7129193 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7129194 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7129195 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7129196 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7129197 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7129198 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7129199 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7129200 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7129201 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7129202 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7129203 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7129204 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7129205 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7129206 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7129207 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7129208 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

7129214 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7129215 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7129216 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7129217 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7129218 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7129219 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7129220 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7129221 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7129222 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7129223 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7129224 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7129225 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7129226 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7129227 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7129228 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7129229 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7129230 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7129231 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7129232 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7129233 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7129234 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7129235 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7129236 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7129237 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
7129238 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7129239 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7129240 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7129283 if we step in now will we not weaken the powers of parliament of course if parliament doesnt do what it should the court should step in but is the timing right here
7129284 this court is duty bound to respect parliament what bothers me is that the real effect of what glenister asks the court to do would be for us to say we just dont trust parliament to get it right
7129285 glenister can bring a challenge in nine months time but in the interim our ability to fight organized crime will diminish how much additional crime are we willing to tolerate while parliament considers the legislation

7129303 well what difference would it make by your logic is there some moral difference in going topless vs walking around totally in the nude there is really no difference logically
7129304 i dont know why prostitution is illegal in this nation if going topless in a city like nyc is legal
7129305 where does it say in the bible that it is not ok with god for people to go topless after all adam and eve wore no clothing before they sinned
7129306 we are expected to make decisions based on gods holiness as we follow him in purity

7129316 facial transplantation could be successful in the short term but the procedure is not without complications this case suggests facial transplantation might be an option for restoring a severely disfigured face and could enable patients to readily integrate themselves back into society
7129317 our case confirms that face transplantation is surgically feasible and effective for the correction of specific disfigurement due in this case to a genetic disorder long term follow up is needed to assess the risks linked to the immunogenicity of allogenic composite tissues particularly as regards life expectancy following this initial success other patients are currently being assessed

7129355 cualquier cosa que haya sucedido entre aishwarya y yo ha terminado soy realmente aficionado a los bachchans abhishek es un compa ero y yo realmente lo quiero yo no har que nadie hable mal acerca de su esposa
7129356 antes desde entonces de su ruptura con aishwarya salman hab a estado obsesionado con ella ante todos sus amigos mutuos salman buscar a deliberadamente a personas que fueron cercanas a aishwarya y les hac a preguntas indefinidamente acerca de ella y les narraba cuentos tristes acerca de cu n mal ella lo trat all vino un tiempo cuando amigos que los conoc a a ambos empezaron a evitarlo
7129357 salman ha conseguido reponerse del tema aishwarya y es bastante protector hacia ella el no permite que nadie hable en contra de ella
7129358 l con orgullo dice a la gente como jayaji sol a decir aishwarya se ve mejor en la pantalla con salman
7129359 el lo dice orgullosamente a personas c mo jayaji dec a aishwarya mira el mejor en la pantalla con salman aunque salman es muy aficionado a los bachchans y ahora considera a aishwarya como parte esencial de esa familia l no ser emparejado jam s con ella profesionalmente

7129362 to me it is very intimidating to do it this way
7129363 it could easily be construed they are trying to get no answers at all it certainly doesnt make me very comfortable the truth is being ascertained
7129364 well ask them about the checks that were conducted and whether or not they asked for them approved of them things of that nature
7129365 to me it would be a lot less invasive and create a lot less anxiety if they received a written response first
7129366 this just raises more questions about the processes and procedures
7129367 they want to identify their loved ones soon so they can go home people are anxious to begin the grieving process
7129368 we would have gotten the same information had it been a janitor speaking to us
7129369 we understand the frustration and we share it because we lost nine crew members in this flight but there are things which only the investigating team can determine

7129378 yo vengo de esa epoca cuando era chico la manera de jugar a ser grande no era con computadoras sino con velas e incienso tomando cerveza liviana y escuchando musica de hendrix era la concepcion mas inocente en un mundo en que los musicos pensaban en la musica y no en los ranking las fm o los discos de platino honestamente creo que un retroceso en ese sentido no vendria nada mal a un par de artistas y el publico podria volver a disfrutar de buena musica en vez de comprar pedazos de plastico

7129548 figuring out how to make the game experience more fun than any one of a hundred facebook applications is going to be a challenge
7129549 many of the games we make in 2020 wont look like games and maybe wont even be called games
7129550 the bull case for facebook is that their actions have cut out low quality applications and that developer activity will rise again as they start producing better content
7129551 it is not that horror films do not find an audience in india it is just that there are very few film makers in bollywood who would attempt anything as offbeat as supernatural thrillers or similar versions of occult themes
7129552 horror films amount to an occupancy rate of only 25 30 in multiplexes bhoot however managed to procure a 50 occupancy rate owing to its star cast
7129553 young audiences are always eager to watch experimental films and since they are cued in to television radio and the internet it was natural for us to exploit these avenues
7129554 it is only an attempt to market a product in an innovative manner
7129555 indian audiences look for a feel good factor in films very few people would want to shell out rs 250 to rs 300 to watch a horror film and get depressed hence they avoid such films horror films need to be interspersed with either a comedy track or good music to break even
7129556 most horror films lack a corporate backing and are made on a shoestring budget of around rs 1 crore an amount which is lesser than what most films spend on merely shooting a song thus marketing these films on a large scale also becomes difficult sometimes
7129557 most thrillers and horror films recover very little from theatrical revenues and hardly any money from satellite rights as they can be aired on tv only post prime time mentions acharya

7129568 it would be wrong to say were planning a test there that would be going too far but its fair to say were looking at it but before we make any decision we need to ascertain whether it is viable first it has to stack up there has to be a genuine reason for being there

7129577 theres no doubt were finishing the season very poorly this is three years in a row this has happened in the last month and were finishing about the same 10 or 11 wins we cant get past that
7129578 were going to have to move some players on simple as that
7129579 i said at the start of the season this is a watershed year for the club we cant finish this year waiting for potential to happen and waiting for players even our own juniors who we thought might go another level who havent its time to bite the bullet and go look for some players to improve the club
7129580 weve had three years to improve on 05 and to win a comp and not make the semis i think changes have to be made
7129581 i dont know what sort of changes but we cant keep going on doing the same things coming up with the same results
7129582 it was probably the response that we needed it was all about righting the ship a little bit
7129583 were just still a little loose in our defence that we need to correct
7129584 this grouping of stores fits with our historical pattern of building a concentration of stores in new markets to leverage efficiencies in logistics marketing and management supervision
7129585 the company does not expect these stores to achieve profitability for several years but believes the opportunity presented by the whitehall jewellers acquisition was one which would enable michael hill international to enter this market on favourable terms
7129586 ive still got time to get as many medals as him
7129587 this is a stepping stone for me ill give it everything ive got over the next four years and hopefully medal next time this has been a huge learning curve for me
7129588 could get up to six olympics if i tried dad was 40 when he was at his fifth olympics so if i wanted to go to 40 though i probably wont because i might be playing bowls instead
7129589 i had an average start i didnt quite have the gusto but kicked at halfway and caught up but my arms went to jelly in the last 100m
7129590 im definitely keen to keep the ball rolling weve got a lot of young kids coming through back home and weve got a lot of support from sparc we have a programme that will give them a better path to follow so im looking forward to that
7129591 they embody the spirit of everything that is wild and free about the furthest reaches of the planet

7129594 we basically managed to go to all the islands that have albatross in new zealand and new zealand is the albatross capital of the world with more than half the worlds species nesting here
7129595 its pretty demanding but its extremely rewarding at the same time just because there is nowhere else i would rather be
7129596 its something that you happily put up with and even that in itself the wildness the harshness itself is part of that fantastic wild spirit

7129600 i dont have any problems any injuries im trying to get back in shape so im trying to train very hard and doing my best to get as fit as possible for the tournament
7129601 finally i dont have my physical problem anymore its finished its now a matter of getting all these leg muscles back and feeling like i used to feel before when i was fit and ready to play
7129602 im still working very hard and some of the things dont happen overnight i need time to train you cannot get your endurance and your strength back in a few days
7129603 so i will try to keep working hard and we will see how everything goes
7129604 ive had a tough year with injuries so many injuries and i was also sick in the middle of the year
7129605 ive been struggling because when you have these kinds of problems its tough to train 100 per cent i finally decide to train and i have some other problem where i have to rest one week or two weeks so i lose matches
7129606 tennis nowadays believe it or not is the most popular sport in serbia

7129610 i think the doctors pretty much know how to estimate the damage there off the bat when its as bad as it apparently is
7129611 i guess everything there is subject to the scanning and all that but it certainly isnt good
7129612 it would depend on how bad it is but if it requires surgery its a six month injury
7129613 not many people get to go out on their own terms in this sport and that would be very sad for him if he missed a big farewell
7129614 im sure the club would still give him a magnificent farewell but its not the way he would like to have gone out hed like to go out with his boots on im sure

7129618 the booing was perfectly understandable because we are the world champions and we cannot afford to lose two in a row its unacceptable to play like that
7129619 it was all about execution because the chances were there but we cannot make mistakes like we did today its unacceptable for any international player it was not good enough and unfortunately those mistakes killed us
7129620 its not nice being booed but the crowd is unhappy rightfully so they have every right to be unhappy
7129621 they want to back a winning side but we never go out there to lose on purpose and its a new playing style im trying to get out there rome wasnt built in a day and i ask the people to be patient to give us more time
7129622 youve got to be happy with that the performance was by no means error free but it was never going to be with south africa such a desperate team but the intensity was there the boys got up and did what had to be done the hard way they gutsed it out it was not straightforward and im very happy with the composure
7129623 the boys got up and met the physicality of the springboks they did huge work and it was a good effort
7129624 weve done a couple of shoulders berrick barnes and dan vickerman and thats likely to impact on next week theyre unlikely to be available and well definitely contemplate bringing someone over

7129633 robinho doesnt want to stay thats why the club must find him a way out

7129637 china drew 2 2 with australia last night and pipped their opponents to qualify for the womens field hockey semi finals
7129638 i feel like im in a great place in my career for being in just my third year being on this team is an honor and im just soaking it all
7129639 this is 12 people as opposed to 26 27 after injuries and replacements
7129640 this is one of the best honors you can have
7129641 when people ask whos the best people like different things he could be lumped in with steve nash jason kidd chris paul all these guys i dont know how you distinguish whos the best but hes definitely in the argument
7129642 but you got two of the best when youre talking about chris and deron they dont have to score they can dictate the game by finding their teammates thats a true point guard
7129643 we play well together mesh well offensively defensively we bring a lot of energy pressure the ball a lot im having a blast playing with chris
7129644 i think they respect one another so much and theyre confident in their own stuff that they just allow each other to be good against germany on the break one time deron hits chris and another time chris hits deron when theyre in the game we have young legs great pressure and its a different look its been a key part of our team
7129645 there was a time in the spain game where he just got the ball and said i want to score and he went down the lane and you could see it in him
7129646 theres no way youre going to stop him when he gets that mentality because hes so big and strong and athletic
7129647 he was pretty much handed the ball and allowed to play free i was playing two guard one guard sometimes i wouldnt play sometimes id play 30 minutes
7129648 we had different coaches and one coach really doesnt like rookies
7129649 sometimes it seems like it was a long time ago sometimes it seems like it was yesterday
7129650 i think it has gone by fast my three years in the league when i say im going into my fourth year it seems like it flew by
7129651 im just a lot more confident right now as a player probably as a person too
7129652 i tended to shy away from the media and stuff when i was in college i didnt like all the attention
7129653 as a player i was confident in college but im a way better scorer than i was
7129654 im willing to try more than i would in college
7129655 im just a different player its kind of hard to explain but i didnt really have to be a scorer on my team in college for us to have success im more consistent now where i have more good games in a row ive figured out how to bring it every night
7129656 me and d will feel honored to be in this situation
7129657 we understand that were definitely connected for the rest of our careers but this is representing our country and not too many guys get this opportunity so were trying to take full advantage of it
7129658 we will be seeking more specific information about why he was picked up and held and about his experience during his incarceration
7129659 im just trying to get an opinion on what i need to do how bad the injury is and if i can do anything to play im going to do the best i can to get back on the field and get ready for carolina
7129660 if a guy has a setback and it keeps him out of it for a week or two i dont know that anyone will remember that any player missed a week of practice or was dealing with an issue

7129669 surge of us troops to iraq that mr bush ordered in early 2007
7129670 real central front in the war on terrorism is not iraq
7129671 if we should have had a surge anywhere it is afghanistan senator biden said in a recent opinion article in the
7129672 afghanistans fate is directly tied to pakistans future and americas security
7129673 the recent pakistani elections gave the moderate majority its voice back senator biden wrote
7129674 to demonstrate to its people that we care about their needs not just our own we must triple assistance for schools roads and clinics sustain it for a decade and demand accountability for the military aid we provide
7129675 i believe the united states should agree to directly engage iran first in the context of the p 5 plus 1 and ultimately country to country just as we did with north korea senator biden said in an early july press statement
7129676 the net effect of demanding preconditions that iran rejects is this we get no results and iran gets closer to the bomb he said

7129681 i have long sought to help russia realise its extraordinary potential as a force for progress in the international community and have supported legislative efforts intended to forge a more constructive relationship with the kremlin
7129682 will have consequences on its ties to washington he said
7129683 russias failure to keep its word and withdraw troops from georgia risks the countrys standing as part of the international community
7129684 i think the downward spiral of house prices could be a very serious problem to the economy there is no evidence that is going to stop
7129685 it is not clear where the lift will come from
7129686 what is daunting now is that weve got a lot to go we now have a weak consumer and after some amount of time well have a weak business sector and a major global slowdown in growth all of this will reverberate back into the economy
7129687 and the big wild card is how long does it take to deleverage consolidate squeeze down costs and then have some liveliness in the business of financial service
7129688 that process time wise along with financial problem could easily take a year
7129689 i think the most likely scenario is by early next year things start to work themselves out
7129690 i dont think were likely to get a very robust recovery but i dont think a more disastrous scenario is the most likely case either
7129691 i think six months from now we will start to see the light at the end of the tunnel of the housing crisis
7129692 at that point some of the uncertainty about how much home prices will fall will start to dissipate
7129693 that will open the door for the fed hiking rates

7129722 really if we live in a just world this will be the end of joe bidens political career
7129723 the are more and less charitable readings of what biden said but theres no way to read it which doesnt reflect very poorly on biden
7129724 i think at this point you have to say that biden suffers from what one might with real generosity call chronic racial grandpaism that is to say the penchant for making comments that are not only racially offensive but also extremely silly
7129725 its like the fourth indiana jones picture there are forces in play to make it happen and forces in play to make it not happen i think we will try to write a screenplay

7129957 hey if youre getting chicken nuggets honey mustard is good for dunkin it in
7129958 theres no doubt were finishing the season very poorly this is three years in a row this has happened in the last month and were finishing about the same 10 or 11 wins we cant get past that
7129959 were going to have to move some players on simple as that
7129960 i said at the start of the season this is a watershed year for the club we cant finish this year waiting for potential to happen and waiting for players even our own juniors who we thought might go another level who havent its time to bite the bullet and go look for some players to improve the club
7129961 weve had three years to improve on 05 and to win a comp and not make the semis i think changes have to be made
7129962 i dont know what sort of changes but we cant keep going on doing the same things coming up with the same results
7129963 it was probably the response that we needed it was all about righting the ship a little bit
7129964 were just still a little loose in our defence that we need to correct
7129965 the booing was perfectly understandable because we are the world champions and we cannot afford to lose two in a row its unacceptable to play like that
7129966 it was all about execution because the chances were there but we cannot make mistakes like we did today its unacceptable for any international player it was not good enough and unfortunately those mistakes killed us
7129967 its not nice being booed but the crowd is unhappy rightfully so they have every right to be unhappy
7129968 they want to back a winning side but we never go out there to lose on purpose and its a new playing style im trying to get out there rome wasnt built in a day and i ask the people to be patient to give us more time
7129969 youve got to be happy with that the performance was by no means error free but it was never going to be with south africa such a desperate team but the intensity was there the boys got up and did what had to be done the hard way they gutsed it out it was not straightforward and im very happy with the composure
7129970 the boys got up and met the physicality of the springboks they did huge work and it was a good effort
7129971 weve done a couple of shoulders berrick barnes and dan vickerman and thats likely to impact on next week theyre unlikely to be available and well definitely contemplate bringing someone over
