150068 unhappy california business won the support of mayor antonio r villaraigosa of los angeles who wrote a letter
150069 the federal system to check the working papers of new hires
150070 i find comfort in the fact that the longer im in politics the less nourishing popularity becomes that a striving for rank and fame seems to betray a poverty of ambition and that i am answerable mainly to the steady gaze of my own conscience
150071 i dont think mccain can afford to do any more major reshuffling without running the risk of key republicans concluding that hes hopeless and abandoning him en masse

150089 hey were contributing all this money but not getting much back in benefits so the hell with this system
150090 hey this is to help old folks whove worked all their lives
150091 he stayed for a good almost half hour afterwards shaking hands listening to our concerns talking to us
150092 pointed out that he supported bill clinton with both ginsberg sic and breyer
150093 we have seen this before there is dirt and lies that are circulated in e mails and they pump them out long enough until finally you a mainstream reporter asks me about it

150099 youd imagine that someone like the senator who is constantly traveling and constantly on how can he return these personal e mails
150100 done a brilliant job of insulating itself for the down cycle

150105 supported by fed chairman alan greenspan and treasury secretary larry summers
150106 but we must enact comprehensive immigration reform we must make it a top agenda item if we dont do it before and we probably wont a little straight talk as of january 2009
150107 mr mccain has made some gains in reassuring conservatives nervous about his views on issues like immigration polls suggest
150108 there were not all of these pundits and bloggers and everything who were all over it
150109 you bloggers do a great job digging up stories for us in the msm keep it up
150110 on a message to balance the crazy left wing things a president obama is sure to try
150111 what it says is that im not very well known in that part of the country
150112 sen clinton i think is much better known coming from a nearby state of arkansas so its not surprising that she would have an advantage in some of those states in the middle
150113 last time i checked illinois was more nearby kentucky than arkansas heck they even touch
150114 i snt there something a tad condescending in his reference to

150120 i know neither actor but i assume they were acting
150121 unless we enact comprehensive immigration reform i dont think you can take it piecemeal
150122 because as soon you and i start to talk about the highly skilled workers our agricultural interest people are going to say look we need ag workers too
150123 we get in this kind of a circular firing squad on immigration reform in the congress of the united states
150124 and the lesson i learned from it is weve got to have comprehensive immigration reform
150125 a flake and a poser and an attention seeking diva
150126 just to say how special it is in the whole universe we might be among the few beings that have the chance of seeing something like that
150127 the fact that we have a moon and that the moon passes in front of our sun and that the apparent size of our moon is approximately equal to the apparent size of the sun all these factors combine to create the solar eclipse phenomenon
150128 as has been their hallmark this congress bush mccain republicans have once again run away from an important debate failing to back up their words with action

150144 i didnt think id want to get in coaching when my career ended
150145 but i started coaching high school football last year im on staff there and being a part of that the passion came back fast
150146 i thought hed be perfect as an intern from the standpoint of taking the returners and talking about his experience
150147 so much of what they do is their natural instinct so as a coach when youre coaching all 11 guys sometimes its really hard to get detailed with the returners you dont want to inhibit their creativity but with jeff there are things he can work with them on about concepts and technique
150148 you have to get your eyes around and locate the ball right away on that drill

150158 if you dont have it dont spend it even if you do have it dont spend it because you might need it later
150159 its surprising that energy output has not responded to higher prices
150160 its something we need to wake up to here just because we have it doesnt mean were going to be able to sell it
150161 the main challenges that face barrick and i think i may as well speak for the industry at large are the cost factors
150162 we still believe that the canadian economy will avoid an outright recession but it could be on the edge
150163 unless congress steps up with another and more effective stimulus package which it absolutely should future gdp reports will be even worse
150164 the impact of the foreign sector on the economy in the last three quarters has been extraordinary

150186 purtroppo ha affermato il presidente dellorganismo consiliare giuseppe sagliocco fi ho dovuto constatare come per la maggior parte delle altre strutture sanitarie fino ad oggi valutate una significativa e preoccupante carenza di documentazione atta a supportare lattivit della commissione un dato questo che ci vedr costretti ad una nuova convocazione per i primi di settembre
150187 le audizioni di oggi ha spiegato sagliocco a margine della seduta confermano intanto come sia per il cardarelli che per listituto pascale scontiamo pesantissimi ritardi sul fronte dellattuazione dei programmi di edilizia sanitaria ritardi e inadempienze anche della regione che si traducono poi oltre che in mancate occasioni in un vero e proprio spreco di risorse atteso lenorme volume di contenzioso sorto con ditte appaltatrici e tecnici progettisti
150188 quanto agli obbiettivi fissati dal piano di rientro e dal piano sanitario visto che anche il pascale sebbene irrcs sia tenuto comunque fare la sua parte ha poi affermato sagliocco possibile rilevare pi di una criticit tanto i ordine alla necessit di sfrondare le ancora esistenti diseconomie in termini di ricorso a consulenze o istituti affini che in ordine alla mancata soppressione o accorpamento di strutture doppione
150189 c poi un elemento di novit per certi versi inaspettato ha aggiunto sagliocco che attiene al versante della ricerca clinica e scientifica che entrambe le realt sanitarie sebbene in condizioni diverse praticano il dato emergente assolutamente preoccupante e presenta profonde analogie con quello del malgoverno della sanit lassoluta mancanza di una programmazione complessiva a monte che genera una condizione di assoluta autoreferenzialit ed una mole di progetti quasi sempre scollegati tra loro se non a volte fotocopia con quel che ne consegue in termini di spreco di risorse

150321 in normal day life you dont get given multiple choice questions to sit
150322 which is the space where we hold on to information if there are too many options it is hard to keep track of them and by the last option they have forgotten the first
150323 but shifting the focus up and down and from left to right required when answering a multiple choice question can lead them to read inaccurately especially if there are lots of possible answers
150324 it is like the piano it is frequently the worst musical instrument for dyslexics to learn
150325 for the vast majority of people it is a reasonable compensation because you cant take the whole range of adjustments into consideration and have to go with a rule of thumb
150326 its not about changing the whole system but putting in reasonable adjustments to create an even playing field
150327 so long as multiple choice questions are well structured and short they should be fairly accessible

150331 this is one of the most unimaginable things to actually happen to a child
150332 this woman may have given birth to the little boy but she is no mother to have done things like this
150333 this child was brave enough to tell the truth and thankfully the jury believed that truth
150334 you knew didnt you there could be no pregnancy since you had a tubal ligation and a hysterectomy years before
150335 she has had a hard life but has a supporting family and can fulfill all the requirements of probation if you recommend it
150336 we can be here for hours and hours to talk about all the bad things she has done but if you recommend probation she can walk out of this courtroom and go down the elevator with you

150342 i certainly have pushed for digital distribution on the title globally im responsible for all dd deals but capcom japan so far has not allowed it

150355 as a health care organization committed to the health and safety of our patients we have a responsibility to take a leadership role on this major health issue

150361 congress should not adjourn until weve done something to bring down the high cost of gasoline
150362 i dont see how the leadership can adjourn when the folks back home are looking to us to help them with their gas prices and grocery prices they are struggling to meet their familys needs and congress should be helping them
150363 i am also an original cosponsor of the american energy act an all of the above energy strategy developed by members of the house republican conference
150364 republicans are asking for a simple up or down vote on this bill before congress adjourns
150365 none of these votes led to more domestic production but my legislation would take this decision out of the hands of congress and place it back where it belongs with the residents of the state of alaska
150366 this is much too long to leave americans hostage to the gas pumps
150367 exploting our suffering at the gas pump as an excuse to represent big oil
150368 every informed person knows there isnt enough oil in anwar to dramatically impact the price of gas
150369 the study also predicts a 2 to 6 percent decline in market share for all imported liquid petroleum products
150370 this means the price per barrel of oil would fall between only 41 cents and 1
150371 this is testimony to the headwinds facing the manufacturing sector
150372 this lower sales business activity does not bode well for activity in the manufacturing sector over the near term pointing to a further reduction in demand consistent with weaker purchasing manager expectations of business conditions in six months
150373 while the recent oil price decline coupled with some appreciation of the currency will bring some relief going forward rising transport and energy costs continue to threaten a recovery in the sector

150377 she is not just a reporting conduit she has much more power than the npa would have understand her powers to be

150379 the ifpyb agrees that in some instances name changes are necessary but we are angered by sascos call to change the name of the mangosuthu university of technology
150380 everyone was brown except one of my mariah carey amp leona lewis
150381 the one thing that worries me about him is hes too nice
150382 because he is very nice i wondered if hed be tough enough to be the head coach when everyones jumping down your throat we have found out he has an inner toughness that makes him able to handle it
150383 ive seen as much expectations with a player like herschel walker during his freshman year but not with a team
150384 people started talking national championship after the sugar bowl last year
150385 thats too long to be chewing on that bone so to speak i told the players that this preseason hype could be a blessing or a curse its a curse if you think it gives you a sense of entitlement to where you think you dont have to prepare it could be a blessing if you look at it as one of the greatest opportunities of your life
150386 after watching a good movie everyone is waiting for the second one to come out
150387 when i looked for what was the problem i looked in the mirror the players were pretty much doing what i was doing sitting waiting for something to happen so i thought maybe i needed to change
150388 even if we got to fake it were going to have more energy
150389 after the first score against florida i want you guys to celebrate so hard that the referees throw the flag
150390 i wont do anything like that again it could have easily turned into a big stupid brawl
150391 im not so stubborn that im not open to change
150392 people would say oh my gosh hes changed and id say no he hasnt at home hes pretty goofy pretty fun its just about him finding his role now
150393 she can pour two cups know that its a first down and 9 and where the ball is and pass out cups at the same time
150394 i tried to be quiet at first but i had to yell encouragement i couldnt help it
150395 it helped us realize how privileged we are and sometimes dont appreciate the blessings we do have
150396 it seems like it goes in cycles and in bunches and i think its historically gone from one school to the other as being the school with the most problems as nice as he is they know they cant get away with everything hes made some tough discipline decisions and that speaks volumes
150397 i told him if he changed his mind make sure you call me first thing in the morning he didnt call me at 6 or 7 oclock in the morning he called me at 2 or 3 in the morning and he said yes
150398 he has the best chance of anybody in this day and time of staying at one place because of his production and type of person he is but you need both

150400 we are looking at fixed mobile technologies as well as purely mobile technologies and if an opportunity presents itself well look at it
150401 its a confidential issue and i dont want to prejudice any potential negotiations
150402 these negotiations are long and protracted they involve existing shareholders and in some cases governments and regulators
150403 senator mccain has always said that withdrawal has to be based on conditions on the ground and the judgment of military commanders
150404 theres not as much disagreement there as i think people may perceive
150405 the resources they consider necessary to carry out their mission
150406 no amount of additional u s forces can affect the outcome
150407 john mccains essential focus has been on the tactical issue of sending more troops
150408 hes made his entire approach to foreign policy rest on that support of bushs decision to send more troops in
150409 senator obama doesnt understand he doesnt understand whats at stake here
150410 he chose to take the political path that would have helped him get the nomination of his party
150411 if we place 30 000 more troops in there then we would see an improvement in the security situation and a reduction in the violence
150412 i think it is indisputable that weve seen violence reduced
150413 and thats a credit to our brave men and women in uniform

150426 jamars decision to violate the terms of our personal agreement for his potential return to our basketball program has left me with no other recourse but to rescind that opportunity
150427 at this time jamar and his family need to focus their attention on the issues that have brought jamar to this point
150428 for the good of our program and players we need to move forward and prepare for the 2008 09 season while jamar will always be a part of the illinois basketball family i have made the decision that he can no longer be a part of our team our entire team and coaching staff are obviously very disappointed he will not be with us we will continue to do everything we can to help him continue his academic career and achieve his goal of graduation

150432 pro and con should congress authorize construction of nuclear power plants
150433 for the past 15 years or so the holy grail of nems has been to push them to a small enough size with high enough sensitivity so that they might resolve the mass of a single molecule or even single atom
150434 this has been a challenge even at cryogenic temperatures where reduced thermal noise improves the sensitivity we have achieved sub single atom resolution at room temperature
150435 unlike mass spectrometry our device does not require the ionization of neutral atoms or molecules that can destroy samples such as proteins also unlike mass spectrometers our carbon nanotube mass sensor becomes more sensitive at higher mass ranges which makes it more suitable for measuring large biomolecules like dna finally our device is small enough so that in time it could be incorporated onto a chip
150436 this decision should send a clear signal to the bush administration that it must cooperate fully with congress and that former administration officials harriet miers and karl rove must testify before congress
150437 i have not yet talked with anyone at the white house and dont expect that this matter will be finally resolved in the very near future
150438 harriet miers is not immune from compelled congressional process she is legally required to testify pursuant to a duly issued congressional subpoena
150439 that simple yet critical fact bears repeating the asserted absolute immunity claim here is entirely unsupported by existing case law
150440 if the administration appeals the ruling our congressional prerogatives will once again be put at risk
150441 we look forward to the white house complying with this ruling and to scheduling future hearings with ms miers and other witnesses who have relied on such claims
150442 we hope that the defendants will accept this decision and expect that we will receive relevant documents and call ms miers to testify in september
150443 i look forward to working with the white house and the justice department to coordinate the long overdue appearances
150444 im sure it will be appealed and it will go on into next year and it will become a moot issue
150445 overdoing the doom one of his sources reported the start of a federal program of extended benefits

150448 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
150449 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
150450 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
150451 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
150452 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
150453 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
150454 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
150455 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
150456 i respect and admire sen obama we just have stark differences
150457 campaigns are tough but im proud of the campaign we have run
150458 im proud of the issues we have tried to address with the american people all i can say is we are proud of that commercial
150459 we can most assuredly tell you that voters around the country do not think theres anything substantive about this latest ad do not think its something that john mccain should be proud of
150460 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
150461 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
150462 i have consciously taken the principled decision to uphold the constitution of india at the risk of being unjustifiably dubbed as anti party
150463 fulfil my obligations and responsibilities as the speaker during my tenure
150464 we are delighted to be negotiating with canary wharf for a new building which we intend to be a premier facility in the heart of a premier financial district
150465 we all know there is not enough money to do all this stuff
150466 don cazayoux should go to work in the construction industry since he would obviously make a much better road block than congressperson for the people of louisiana
150467 don cazayouxs obstruction of critical energy legislation is no longer surprising but it is appalling
150468 a painting by or attributed to caravaggio judass kiss has been stolen from a museum in odessa by a thief or thieves who broke in through a window
150469 the university is committed to diversity as evidenced by the development of the onewvu program our coaches and staff also are committed to an atmosphere of community for our student athletes i look forward to speaking with pat more about his thoughts
150470 weenie greenie espn radios mike greenberg gives us all a lesson in arrogance
150471 we were seated just a few feet from her she used the expression f word and horses rear a number of times served to him underhand and didnt even try to play the match a shame for her partner who probably would have liked the win in his column
150472 if it was up to the athletes it would have happened a long time ago
150473 it agreement satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements
150474 only a very small percentage of the notebook chips that have shipped are potentially affected and the problem depends on a combination of environmental conditions configuration and usage model
150475 we do not presently know how these interventions perform outside a trial
150476 despite the current situation we are facing with the diabetes epidemic there are not enough long term data available to come to any confident conclusions
150477 or by members of their community using health education materials that had been adapted to that communitys cultural needs
150478 however it should be borne in mind that we still do not know the necessary dose of health education needed or the level of reinforcement of messages to ensure continued benefits
150479 longer term studies with more patient centered outcomes are needed
150480 people with diabetes are among those who would benefit the most from these prevention strategies
150481 i commend cnn and soledad obrien for tackling this very important topic but to expose an audience to this theory is very troubling and disappointing
150482 even though public health researchers have discredited the theory it continues to be promoted by people who are not knowledgeable about the field the average healthcare consumer watching cnn could take this as the gospel and run with it to their own detriment
150483 to suggest that health disparities are caused by a gene that exists in african americans and does not exist in others is ridiculous there are no genes found in only one race group
150484 hypertension and all other major causes of death are caused by a complex set of factors they are not single gene diseases if race disparities were primarily caused by a gene that gene would have to cause hypertension and cancer and diabetes and glaucoma and crohns disease and asthma and hiv aids and every other condition that is more prevalent in blacks and we know no one gene does that
150485 i respect professor fryer but quoting an economist as an expert on health disparities is like interviewing me for a story about why gas prices have spiked
150486 not only are researchers at hopkins working on this problem but people are working on this issue right there in atlanta where cnn is headquartered the problem of health disparities is complex by trying to reduce it to a simplistic explanation we risk having health care providers policymakers and patients feel there is nothing they can do to address the issue
150487 passage of this historic legislation is a crucial turning point in the battle to control aids around the world
150488 over the past several months ahf worked diligently to persuade legislators to restore pepfars priority on treatment we take our hats off to everyone who helped ensure that this lifesaving global aids bill became a reality
150489 the test is a measure of long term glucose control but doctors dont typically use it to screen for or diagnose the disease
150490 theres reason to believe it could help identify many of the estimated six million people in the u s who have diabetes but dont know it
150491 if a patient is scheduled for a physical he or she may tune up by changing their regimen for a few days and throw off their test results causing doctors to miss the patients usual pattern of high blood sugar
150492 could greatly enhance how well were able to identify people with diabetes
150493 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance
150494 it essentially puts a turbo charge on ppar delta which explains why exercise is so important
150495 these results demonstrate that ampk ppar delta pathway can be targeted by orally active drugs to enhance training adaptation or even to increase endurance without exercise
150496 aids is a topic of global importance and we believe that this collection of articles written by some of the leading figures in hiv and aids research will be of great interest to the many researchers and clinicians gathering in mexico city
150497 a better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of b cell abnormalities can potentially lead to new strategies for improving antibody responses
150498 given that bacterial vaginosis and hiv infection are both transmitted sexually it is difficult to determine whether associations found are causal or if there is some other reason why women with bv are more likely that others to become infected with hiv
150499 if additional follow up studies show that there was a relationship between bv and the risk of incident hiv infection though then increasing the treatment of bv could be considered for the future prevention of hiv infection
150500 that may be because women in high risk groups have a greater risk of acquiring hiv from causes other than bv this could be helpful information in identifying which populations would be helped most through targeted bacterial vaginosis control measures
150501 while there is no cure or existing treatment to prevent alzheimers disease there are currently available fda approved treatments such as combination therapy with memantine and a cholinesterase inhibitor which can alleviate symptoms by providing cognitive functional and behavioral benefits
150502 these findings reinforce the safety tolerability and efficacy of memantine in a newly developed once a day formulation
150503 with this novel formulation the efficacy and tolerability of namenda is delivered in a more convenient once daily dose
150504 at a time when bacteria are becoming increasingly resistant to many of our best antibiotics it is an extremely bad idea to risk undermining gentamicins effectiveness for treating human disease by using it to treat a disease in apples
150505 the threat of antibiotic resistance is growing and the number of effective antibiotics is dwindling
150506 our priority must be to save these effective antibiotics for whom they are needed most for humans not for agriculture
150507 as a surgeon robotic surgery enables me to remove the cancerous prostate from patients and help them return to a normal healthy life
150508 instead of two to three days of hospitalization and two months of recuperation typical with open prostate surgery robotic surgery patients often go home the next day and resume normal activities within two weeks
150509 i have seen the number of robotic prostatectomies increase among our patient population over the past couple of years and the benefits are quite clear
150510 these surgeries result in fewer immediate complications and quicker recovery than in an open procedure especially in the hands of a skilled surgeon who performs a high volume of cases routinely
150511 substance abuse varies significantly depending upon the purpose for which these are used for example 28 6 of those drinking alcohol do so to help them get to know a potential sexual partner while 26 2 of those using cocaine take it to make sexual intercourse last longer
150512 those who consume alcohol cannabis cocaine or ecstasy under the age of 16 are likely to have had sexual relations before this age too
150513 the current patterns of drug use among the study participants reflect their number of sexual partners with regular cocaine users in comparison with those who have never taken it being five times more likely to have had five or more sexual partners within the last 12 months or to have paid for sex
150514 prevention experts must be aware of how young people view the relationship between drug use and sexuality there are very few preventive programmes in our country that take this link into consideration
150515 now that we are aware of this link and the associated health risks new programmes and preventive strategies will be needed in addition to further research in the area of drug use and its social psychological and physical links to sexuality based on the real and important experiences of young people themselves
150516 knowing the primary tumor site with greater certainty enables more appropriate cancer treatment the growing trend in cancer care is the use of therapies that target specific tissues and their genomic components rather than relying on a one size fits all treatment approach
150517 we believe the pathwork tissue of origin test will help provide more certainty in tumor diagnosis which will enable more patients to realize the benefits of this new era in genomics based diagnostics
150518 they are time consuming and frustrating for both physicians and patients accurately identifying a tumors origin and thus knowing what kind of cancer the patient has is necessary for beginning standard of care cancer specific treatment per the national comprehensive cancer network clinical practice guidelines knowing the tumors origin can also enable patients to get into and benefit from appropriate clinical trials
150519 traditional tools used to identify tumors of uncertain origin include imaging studies such as ct scans and mris as well as a thorough pathological evaluation with immunohistochemistry and other techniques
150520 however for difficult cases the use of these complex iterative techniques can often take weeks and in some cases they still do not definitively identify the tissue of origin a gene expression test like the pathwork tissue of origin test provides unique information and based on this data it is reasonable to expect that it will improve the diagnosis of uncertain primary tumors
150521 the ultimate goal is to find new ways to help people like the armed forces and first responders stay alert and on top of things when they have to be awake for extended periods of time
150522 we have drugs now that can keep people awake but theyre addictive and lose their effectiveness with repeated use this research should help us find methods for maintaining mental acuity that have more specific effects are less addictive and retain their potency
150523 this tests the flies mental capacity in two ways first theyve got to remember that the lighted vial is the one that has quinine in it and then theyve got to suppress their natural instinct to fly toward the light
150524 using this gene and other related genes we may be able to find better ways to boost performance for someone like a relief worker whos had to stay awake for six straight days trying to save people trapped by an earthquake
150525 i want to emphasize though that this type of treatment would just be for people who absolutely have to stay awake
150526 its not about trying to cram too many hours in your day
150527 they blamed it on everything else under the sun they worked in loud factories they listened to loud music one got hit by a tractor
150528 some people with the mutation have hearing loss in their 40s of the kind we normally see in people a decade or more older
150529 often identifying a gene in individuals who have early onset of a disorder will help explain why the disorder occurs in the general population
150530 in many types of hereditary hearing loss its likely that environmental factors that people can control such as smoking and exposure to noise also can influence how severe the hearing loss is and how early in life it begins
150531 you can have children tested early so they dont have speech or school problems
150532 because of rising demand for body contouring procedures it is increasingly important for plastic surgeons to be cognizant of potential predictors of poor outcomes and or complications that can arise as a result
150533 obesity is a significant risk factor when considering operative procedures particularly due to secondary conditions such as hypertension diabetes sleep apnea cardiovascular disease and poor healing that generally accompany it
150534 these findings lay the groundwork for establishing evidence based medicine guidelines to better assist us in evaluating patients for potential risk when considering these increasingly popular procedures and in weighing those risks against the potential benefits in our varied patients
150535 it is our responsibility as plastic surgeons to do everything possible to ensure the best and safest results for our patients
150536 this finding by kevin eggan and his colleagues marks an important step in fulfilling the promise of regenerative medicine
150537 it is yet more confirmation that the substantial risks that were taken in forming the harvard stem cell institute will ultimately pay off for both science and patients
150538 no one has ever managed to isolate these neurons from a patient and grow them in a dish
150539 now we can make limitless supplies of the cells that die in this awful disease this will allow us to study these neurons and als in a lab dish and figure out whats happening in the disease process
150540 over the last two years weve done everything we could within the law in massachusetts to recruit women to donate ova however we were never able to recruit enough donors because we were legally prevented from providing the same sort of compensation that these women would receive for donating their ova for in vitro fertilization
150541 but its not yet come to fruition so when shinya yamanakas first creation of ips cells came along that opened up a new route for us and we decided to capitalize on that
150542 its essential to note that we couldnt possibly be where we are now without first doing extensive work with human embryonic stem cells hesc further it will be essential to continue to do work with embryonic stem cells as they remain the stem cell gold standard
150543 is to produce neurons from ips cells developed from a normal healthy person and try to determine whats different about the neurons we have made from the als patients
150544 these findings reinforce the fact that women should not drink alcohol during pregnancy
150545 prenatal exposure to alcohol especially excessive amounts at one time can adversely affect the fetus and may increase the risk of infant clefts
150546 the greater the blood alcohol concentration the longer the fetus is exposed a single binge during a critical period of an infants development can be harmful
150547 fortunately heavy maternal drinking is uncommon in many populations but the fact that it is happening at all tells us we need to do a better job of letting mothers know about the effects that alcohol can have on their babys development

150573 alex has been with us since 2005 and has proved his fitness on a consistent basis after overcoming early injury problems
150574 he worked extremely hard over the winter with our strength and conditioning coach and came back as fit as ever for the start of the 2008 campaign
150575 there is no doubt he has a great deal still to offer in the professional game so we agreed that it would be in his best interests to explore alternative opportunities
150576 on that basis we have agreed that we are prepared to loan alex to another county over the course of the rest of the season should an opportunity arise and we wish him well in his future career wherever he ends up
150577 i have thoroughly enjoyed my four years at essex and am delighted to have been able to prove my fitness during my time at the club
150578 i understand my opportunities will be limited with essex from now on but i feel i still have plenty to offer and am keen to get the chance to prove that with another county
150579 the club have been willing for me to play elsewhere this season which is a great gesture on their part and gives me the opportunity of proving myself to any potential employers im still hungry for success
150580 its been frustrating at times not getting a run in the side but i know that ive looked after myself and still have plenty to offer its just a case of getting the opportunity now

150619 im due to go to london and take a look over everything but no deal has been done yet with arsenal

150622 thats when reality hit i just sat there in the middle of the track with the snow coming down just numb thinking im sick of this im sick of the injuries
150623 im thinking i havent run without pain for six years now im getting married soon im about to become a father im not making any money i just dont want to do this any more
150624 the only thing i remember is people jumping out at me and offering me prawns on a fork or a can of fosters afterwards i felt like a complete loser someone just making up the numbers

150634 but dunbar is one of the top five baseball schools in kentucky so it was a very attractive job

150636 his experience under dom fucci at tates creek and turning around bryan stations program means he understands the requirements of coaching in fayette county and dealing with everything
150637 not a lot needs to be done dunbars field is beautiful but we may tweak a few things to fit my style
150638 i think having the first two antitangle medicines is a real landmark
150639 is that tangles form earlier than plaque so it could be that a cocktail of antitangle and anti amyloid drugs will be the most effective therapy

150654 its not like i have any vendetta against the rangers this is where i started toward what ive become as a pitcher
150655 i was successful because i threw first pitch strikes these guys are aggressive early in the count its essentially the same knuckleball i had when i left here ive gained a lot of experience between that time and this time before it was kind of throw and hope i couldnt control it
150656 we took one step in what we knew would be a step by step process
150657 more opportunities lie ahead we moved arthur for a young starting pitcher with promise one who might help us next year

150662 we have significantly increased capacity and reduced fares on the route
150663 as a result aer arann promises easier access and greater choice for business and leisure passengers both in dublin and in the north west
150664 more than 26 000 passengers used the daily derry to dublin service during 2007 and it has proved a vital local connection to and from dublin
150665 this is an excellent vote of confidence in the airport and will boost our efforts to bring scheduled passenger services back to the county
150666 it would mean excessive noise levels will go over an additional 46 000 residents across newham greenwich and tower hamlets

150676 these facilities are for those offenders who are not considered violent or a flight risk
150677 facilities such as these may not have fences although they will have boundaries that are identified theres no razor wire no perimeter posts no towers with guards and generally not as much electronic surveillance
150678 they can go into food service be an orderly or do something like plumbing typically an inmate works a little more than seven hours a day and they can make from 12 to 40 cents an hour our primary goal at our federal facilities is the work aspect
150679 we have a special mission at this facility and that is for medical purposes
150680 but when they do they will have opportunities to use the recreation area or the areas to play basketball or go for walks there are exercise programs and the only televisions are in the central room of each unit which means its a community television
150681 we cant wait to get out on the field and work on the fundamentals and through drills
150682 we want to do the things that will make them better football players
150683 it feels great to see our hard work pay off and everybody come together as a team
150684 i have been out of the game for a couple of years but im glad to be back
150685 im working with kids who want to be here and its exciting
150686 it makes me feel a lot better being out here
150687 with new coaches you have to make sure the players understand expectations
150688 we want the guys to understand the system and learn the practice routine the players have been very accepting of what we try to teach them
150689 whits intense and harping on the little things hes making us a sound fundamental team
150690 im looking forward to the chance to work with the new coaches

150692 we have everything organized the lines and hashes are always there and rain wont affect us
150693 this is a nice facility it has brightened the kids spirits and there is an up tempo attitude here
150694 we want to build upon last year i also want them to understand it was last year and we have to be ready for this year
150695 we need to be focused mentally and ready to go every day and every play
150696 we want to beat newark logan and make the playoffs
150697 we need to provide leadership and keep everybody focused we know how hard we have to go and cant to let up we have to keep pushing ourselves
150698 there are some nerves but i want to get back into the groove
150699 it feels good to be playing again and being a part of the team
150700 its a great feeling to be running around and having some fun
150701 youre definitely here to have fun but also know its time to get down to business no more goofing around
150702 this is our last chance so its time to step up
150703 we have to be leaders and do whats best for our team this is an opportunity of a lifetime
150704 right when we started camp it hit me this would be my last go at sulsberger stadium it gave me goose bumps
150705 this is a lot more intense were running and drilling a lot more
150706 this is a lot harder with two practices in the same day
150707 the receivers are just showing me how to run routes better
150708 the other lineman are helping get my three point stance down perfect and working on my steps
150709 plastics packaging waste in particular is a very visible part of the waste stream and its also growing
150710 ironically as we become more successful at recycling generally whats left in the bin tends to be just the plastic so more and more people are looking in their bins and saying theres just bits of plastic here why cant i recycle them
150711 a lot of packaging is designed to lengthen the shelf life of the products that are being sold so if you take it out of the packaging theres a good chance that it will actually not last as long
150712 and unless youre very very disciplined and most of us frankly arent then youre quite likely to end up by throwing more food away

150723 because the tide came in the animal was having great difficulty in righting itself and water was starting to lap around the blow hole
150724 a decision was taken to put the animal to sleep on welfare grounds
150725 as they made their way to the animal it did manage to right itself and it is now free swimming but in fairly shallow water so right now the prognosis is not good
150726 when an animal restrands for a second time it is often very poorly by that stage
150727 if it hasnt fed it hasnt drank as it gets its water from its food so we are going to have a very frightened distressed animal on our hands
150728 i think if i wasnt actually involved its a show i would go and see
150729 looking back i think we are all quite proud of what we did and how we were able to send music in the direction it went
150730 when you have something as personal as music at the time it can look like fashion
150731 but now looking back you can see that we did have an effect on so many things
150732 i didnt really know martin fry of abc very well
150733 we knew of each other of course and i think hes a great songwriter but we operated at this strange arms length
150734 the funny thing is abcs drummer resigned from the band twice while he was at my house
150735 they will have to be relatively short sets as there are three bands
150736 now it seems people are much more prepared to go out and see people they know i think that there has been a genuine dearth of stars and thats what people want
150737 for me id always prefer to see a live performance if someone has got up there and done it id always applaud them
150738 im getting new tracks together and im assessing whats going on in music
150739 ive got six or seven songs with lyrics and vocal lines so well have to see where that leads im really doing everything including working with computers and im enjoying it much more than i expected although it is very time consuming it takes me hours
150740 if you want to look for it then youll find whatever type of music you want to
150741 music is now more at the centre of things than it has ever been and everyone is doing their own thing which is exciting
150742 we asked but bob politely declined he said hes doing his own thing now
150743 bobs gone in a different musical direction and were about taking it back to basics
150744 well be playing the songs we used to play when we first started off in 1975 all the early stuff that really defined the rats
150745 garry and i talked about it before but although we could have got a few pub gigs we didnt really have the contacts in the music business to make it work from a commercial sense
150746 the music comes naturally to me and garry but the new guys have had to do a bit of homework its not been a problem though theyre such good musicians theyve slipped into it
150747 im not ready for an allotment yet i dont know why not
150748 a lot of people at my age are looking to retire but i dont think thats what life is for ive got the energy stamina and fitness to do it so why not i tell you though it is physically demanding really energetic full on music
150749 we did a gig in devon the other day and the place was hopping it was absolutely electric it was so long since its happened like that i forgot the feeling
150750 were just going to get out there and see what reaction we get but the message is watch this space were back were in action and it could be boomtime again
150751 i think i found jesus on a cheeto as funny as that sounds
150752 i looked at that and i thought oh my that looks like jesus on the cross it was just like wow
150753 if people can find jesus somehow in each of us like shes found in this object that would be a wonderful thing

150759 on the one hand we admire stars for their talent beauty and wealth because we want something to aspire to and when we become attached to their lives it can feel like we are similar just by association
150760 but when celebrities make mistakes like everyone else we glean satisfaction from their downfall but its not malicious the pleasure people get from watching their idols fall down sends a signal that celebrities are just like us their mistakes humanize them and make them relatable
150761 imagine living your life under a microscope where every fumble or mistake is analyzed and misinterpreted
150762 add to that impossible standards of perfection and extreme wealth and youre almost asking a person to fail no one can withstand all that pressure

150945 we will be as sensible as possible and i hope the management act in the same way
150946 the most common reason i hear to vote yes yes does disturb me a little and that is it would give the trade unions staff side negotiators extra leverage in forcing the management to find more money

150964 of course wed like to get that illusive 0 0 rating that champ car came one suburban housewife away from achieving but that requires the perfect storm of a tight impossible to pass motorcycle road course in europe shown on espn 8 at 5 a m
150965 were working on that but for now i think weve got some races that will break new ground in american tv ratings
150966 usually youd want to go into negotiations showing ratings growth after all ratings are what drive the world in big league racing major sponsors dont drop 5 million on a team or league because of attendance they want ratings so going to more road and street races which americans have repeatedly shown they dont watch on tv is um innovative to say the least
150967 hes an experienced player who is tall and a big threat in both penalty areas just what we need
150968 some traders appeared to be acting on speculation that the data storage company could spin off its stake in vmware inc a company it bought in 2004 and took public in 2007

150972 testifying both to the jews and also to the greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ
150973 i solemnly sware to you in gods presence that this is the message of the gospel repent toward god and believe in the lord jesus christ
150974 i am not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to everyone who believeth to the jew first and also to the greek
150975 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came who is over all god blessed for ever amen
150976 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god
150977 well repentance is when i wake up and i decide to look at things differently and i see that much of my life was counter productive and it is not good to yell at my wife and kids or to drink or not practice safe sex and i see how the bible can help me get my life straightened up and make me successful and healthy and lead what is called a victorious life
150978 well i got caught and now others know when i am a shame before men
150979 i feel bad because of what it did to me
150980 i see god as my creator whom i have not honored in my life i see god as the one who gave me life and breath and i have not returned the love and praise which is due to him i see god as the law giver whose holy law i have spurned i see god as the judge in whose presence i must stand in the last day and to whom i must give an account and i have not honored him or given praise to him i have lifted up my hand against him
150981 i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day
150982 i testified of repentance toward god and faith in the lord jesus christ as the savior the lord of the cross the son of god
150983 i dont like the way smoke gets in my hair and my clothes and i worry about the health risk
150984 almost certainly within five years virtually all college campuses will be smoke free
150985 whatever exposure to poisons and particulates might occur from such contact is dwarfed by the exposures to whatever pollutants waft over the campus from any of the schools parking lots or nearby roads
150986 they tell us that such and such an accident happened somewhere that somebody was sued for this somewhere else and theyd like us to consider updating our rules you cant enumerate everything but i think theyd like us to
150987 we used to rely a lot more on common sense
150988 now you have to have it written down i think it takes away a lot of the fun for the kids
150989 its not british and american soldiers that are killing innocent people were trying to protect innocent people
150990 prepared to back and finance terror in the pursuit of destabilising countries whose people wish to live in peace
150991 there were american snipers on rooftops who were shooting people trying to get to their homes even at the hospital the americans arrested injured boys of 15 saying they were insurgents

150996 there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that they were in iraqi territorial waters equally the iranians may well claim that they were in their territorial waters the extent and definition of territorial waters in this part of the world is very complicated
150997 no maritime border has been agreed upon by the two countries
150998 the events in javakhk shattered illusions about a democratic and europeanized georgia illegal intrusion into the houses and arrests as well as illegal detainment of elderly relations of armenian activists create an impression that georgia has become a medieval principality with no law and civil rights and where the local princes have full control over the residents
150999 i will meet with my georgian counterpart in mid september and we will try to resolve the existing problems
151000 the community today is a safer place and our department is better larger and stronger than ever before
151001 thus my work here is done and the department is set on a course to continue to deliver the level and quality of police services so well deserved by the people of prince georges county
151002 history will reflect that under chief highs leadership the prince georges county police department has moved in the right direction of reform that crime has been reduced and more importantly that he completes this part of his legacy in law enforcement knowing that he has impacted the lives of thousands of citizens of prince georges county

151006 what were saying is we want to give them half of their raises thats all were saying
151007 if they dont accept that then im going to have to furlough
151008 what we have said to them is show us the numbers
151009 we get 20 30 reports of cougars in the state of maryland each year
151010 we have yet to be able to confirm any cougar sighting
151011 only three events watergate the iran hostage crisis and the economic downturn of 1992 have driven below 30 percent the number who think things are going well
151012 american drivers are counting on congress to lift the ban and so are american workers
151013 the low approval rating for democratic leaders in congress is not likely to put the partys control of congress in jeopardy
151014 there is no indication in any poll taken by any organization that voters want to see the gop regain control of congress and all generic ballot questions show a wide lead for democratic congressional candidates
151015 youre always more popular before youre actually in charge of things
151016 once youre responsible then youre going to make some people unhappy thats just the nature of politics and these things go in cycles
151017 to get our message across we must be more humble about our shortcomings but more compelling about our achievements

151019 report mccain received 881 450 from big oil since he announced support for offshore drilling
151020 my husband is absolutley opposed to any negative campaigning at all
151021 is it valid to go after barack obama on inexperience being a bit glib perhaps even a bit arrogant for doing the european tour absolutely but you just sound dopey when you put paris hilton in an ad
151022 to come up with a more affirmative narrative for his candidacy why is he running what does he stand for before going after barack obama
151023 mccain has lost the free media contest over the past couple of weeks hes desperate to make the news and controversial attacks are more newsworthy than boilerplate positive ads
151024 the ad is meant to acknowledge reality that he is huge that he is a celebrity
151025 it wasnt meant to be insulting one of the things we learned from hillary clinton running against obama is that railing against his celebrity whining about his celebrity doesnt work
151026 to inject britney spears and paris hilton into the debate is beneath what america deserves
151027 it was a way for them to get attention for yet another inaccurate misleading negative attack people are caught up with the gimmick
151028 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
151029 every time they put up a negative ad were going to respond with the force of truth
151030 most voters wont see the parallels between a presidential candidate and two party girls so a legitimate point about inexperience gets lost in the appearance of name calling
151031 ich wollte eigentlich direkt nach peking fliegen aber jetzt lasse ich die sache zun chst in europa von rzten untersuchen
151032 i was very pleased with didier at carlisle we saw quality in his football and he showed he has the ability to keep possession under pressure he is a thinking footballer in the way in which he can change his mind and his direction once one option is closed off to him
151033 he can deal with potentially troublesome situations by turning out of them he was a little more up to speed against carlisle than he has been it was more of what we were looking for from him
151034 didier is still adjusting to the pace of the game here but this was a really encouraging performance from him
151035 we are aware that he needs time to adjust to the premier league but he is already taking strides forward and im sure he will keep it going
151036 im due to go to london and take a look over everything but no deal has been done yet with arsenal

151038 we have brought in new players including strikers and there has been talk that i may struggle to make it into the first team
151039 well i want to say here and now that i am more than happy to stay at fulham and fight for my place i do not intend walking away from a battle
151040 i proved last season when things werent going well and i wasnt playing that i was willing to knuckle down work even harder in training and that paid off with me getting back into the managers plans for the final weeks of the campaign
151041 now my aim is to start the coming season just like i did 12 months ago scoring goals and then kick on and have a successful campaign
151042 this is something that needs a lot of time to heal it really hurts me to say i have to miss the olympics
151043 after wednesdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
151044 after taking a few different exams and mris the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
151045 there are so many mixed feelings because on wednesday night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
151046 i started to feel the ball better when i broke him early in the second
151047 im due to go to london and take a look over everything but no deal has been done yet with arsenal
151048 it is difficult for us to take a decision but arsenal is certainly something that gokhan needs to look at

151058 i spoke to brahim about coming here and he spoke very well about the club the facilities and the fans
151059 the deal for fulop fell through simply because we couldnt come to an agreement with his agent on personal terms

151061 they are all about getting match fitness but the more time we can give our core players the better
151062 i spoke to brahim about coming here and he spoke very well about the club the facilities and the fans
151063 the lawsuit is under the jurisdiction of the supreme court and has been brought in compliance with the litigation process requirement
151064 so it had issued an order to accept the case
151065 hes trained again today thursday and will train on friday and well have a look at him from there
151066 hes done well in the time weve seen him and to be fair theres probably interest from other sides i would imagine
151067 i like to think of myself as the girl that no one can get that no one can keep in their hand
151068 yes you can buy the miley cyrus cd because she swears off sex
151069 ive got strollers coming out of my ears like 24 of them does anyone want one

151071 it is important for ghanaians to cultivate a maintenance culture we need to change our attitude to government property government and corporate property must be treated as if it were ones private property for it belongs to all the people and is held in trust by the government for all ghanaians ministers and parliamentarians and those in positions of authority should set the example they should use government property lawfully appropriately and efficiently

151079 mr smith has turned over a lot of documents and were looking at the paperwork
151080 its his position he did nothing improper he got the application and filled it out

151169 they nobel prize winners repeatedly observe that eminent scientists get disproportionately great credit for their contributions to science
151170 while relatively unknown scientists tend to get disproportionately little credit for comparable contributions
151171 have contributed as much to the advancement of science as some of the recipients or more
151172 even before i won the prize i spent a lot of time giving talks to students
151173 as a laureate i have an ability to say something that will have more impact than it probably deserves
151174 its mostly a matter of talking to students getting them stimulated and giving them as much good advice as you can about careers in physics
151175 by their very nature those discoveries that most change the way we think about nature cannot be anticipated so i take a historical approach and review what made certain discoveries possible
151176 i personally have cooled helium to 0 0001 k and it stays happily as a liquid
151177 if you say oh my god we need some way of monitoring brain function non invasively and set out to do so without knowing anything about nmr it just would never have happened
151178 i show a picture of my apparatus and put the names of scientists whose contributions were essential in making the discovery i made such as purcell there are 14 names up there but i could easily have put up twice that number
151179 youve got to sometimes back off from what youre doing to make you a better researcher but language lessons or dance classes are not advisable
151180 the political current that denounces the injustices and inequalities of capitalist society and that seeks more egalitarian and democratic social and economic arrangements

151182 the presence of dark matter particles in the galactic halo is supported at a confidence level of 8 2 standard deviations
151183 there is evidence for a modulation in the data at 8 2 sigma stop compatible with what would be expected from some dark matter particles in some galactic halo models full stop anything beyond this is wanting to believe and it smears on the rest of us in the field of course there is no other observed process in nature that peaks in the summer and goes through a low in the winter so this must be dark matter right occam is turning in his grave rusty razor still in hand
151184 i dont believe logically our results can mean anything other than the dark matter signature
151185 weve been looking at this for over a decade and in that time no one has come up with an alternative explanation
151186 even if you ruled out 50 mundane sources who is to say that youve ruled them all out there could be 100 the trouble is that there are so many things that are annually modulated
151187 people have been asking for this data analysis for years
151188 the fact the dama researchers havent responded to this and other requests for specific data analyses stinks to high heaven
151189 maybe they have seen something that confirms this and are waiting for more data
151190 or maybe they havent seen anything and are hoping it will show up
151191 if you claim something like they have you will be under the microscope five years ago people started asking questions but the dama researchers clammed up that secrecy has not changed
151192 the other researchers should be more cautious and more honest in claiming the exclusions that they do
151193 that would be rather unexpected but not totally out of the question
151194 so unless somebody finds some prosaic explanation to the annual variation observed by dama this exotic possibility needs to be explored
151195 if we see something then people will go crazy trying to reproduce damas results but if we see nothing then people will probably lose interest in the claim

151232 aiding persons to sell and be in possession of tobacco manufactured in canada that was not packaged and was not stamped in conformity with the excise act
151233 rising prices fueled a black market with canadian made cigarettes shipped to the u s where taxes were lower then smuggled back across the border
151234 the tobacco companies knew their exports would be sold on the black market police said when the criminal charges were filed in 2003
151235 they were concerned if this went to court the penalty would be even greater
151236 the fines are small compared to the many billions of dollars lost by federal and provincial governments
151237 the hard work the preparation and yes the calculation has been totally worth it

151242 most everyone has been aware of the increasing costs of healthcare the general public is recently becoming more aware of the patient safety and quality risks they face in a hospital and these are all problems that can be addressed with lean
151243 it is no mistake to say that the people at the top of toyota the president ceo chairman and other executives all thoroughly understand production control how many ceos in the world can say this
151244 thinking lean is all about creating compelling value and flowing it as close to burden free as possible to the customer
151245 what distinguishes toyota from everyone else is its dedication to the lean principle of respect for people
151246 i need a visual control to tell me if the standard is met in order to avoid mistakes or failure

151249 my son was a prodigal at times but he came back
151250 he really committed his life to christ in the last two years of his life he couldnt have been in a better place spiritually
151251 my son wasnt perfect my son he was just a little rascal is what he was and he drove us to our knees many many times in his life
151252 but he had a tender heart he would always get caught whenever he did something wrong his little eyes would fill with tears and he was just so sorry
151253 a good clean bottom turn into a slow stall for the barrel
151254 as tragic and shocking as it is we all know that his son did not die in vain
151255 it will become a profound message and greg laurie will use that and send it to millions of people for the rest of his life
151256 the lord is with me our faith is true and in the darkest hour he will be with you too you dont have to be afraid
151257 you think youll live forever because youre so young my son was young but he was prepared
151258 just to say how special it is in the whole universe we might be among the few beings that have the chance of seeing something like that
151259 the fact that we have a moon and that the moon passes in front of our sun and that the apparent size of our moon is approximately equal to the apparent size of the sun all these factors combine to create the solar eclipse phenomenon

151264 marijuana remains a controlled substance and it is illegal under federal law to possess dispense or cultivate marijuana in any form
151265 i think two issues are going to overshadow what both sides want to do one is the lingering feeling from the beef demonstrations and then this more recent territorial dispute over the dokdo islands
151266 certainly the president doesnt have much time and its somewhat of a legacy issue for him
151267 hes going to focus particularly on verification and moving forward with north korea and getting advice on that
151268 north korea can surprise it can surprise in all kinds of ways but they rarely meet a deadline
151269 without this action which we hope the north will take the delisting will not occur on that time line
151270 i think that it certainly didnt enhance the atmosphere for the visit but on the other hand the president has demonstrated leadership
151271 and we have a very very good relationship with the south korean people
151272 these are not comprehensive or full scope safeguards unlike with npt member states
151273 but it satisfies indias needs while maintaining all the agencys legal requirements
151274 as with other safeguards agreements between the agency and member states the agreement is of indefinite duration there are no conditions for discontinuation other than those provided by the safeguards agreement itself
151275 you are going to see more airlines go bust if you look around there are a lot of airlines out there that have not been profitable in the past few years those guys will not survive
151276 as hedging unwinds within the industry airlines are going to have to reflect the higher oil price we will have to do something and its not just ba that will have to adjust prices the whole industry will have to we are not reflecting the spot price of oil today what is reflected in our fares is the oil price net of hedging
151277 we are honest and realistic about this in a way that a lot of airlines are not we have asked ourselves the question of what does the industry look like at 150 per barrel and what do we do to be one of the airlines that succeeds in that environment we dont just want to hang in there
151278 we are not talking about grounding aircraft but the average utilisation will come down slightly
151279 we had had some electrical issues the week before so it wasnt unusual
151280 so you can imagine the accumulation of things you love
151281 i bought one and then the next and the next
151282 i didnt have to rent space and sit there and wait for customers
151283 were both very positive people and were looking forward to it
151284 the floor person says to me youre emanating an odor but you can go eat at the buffet and well pay for it
151285 how could they possibly say that to me i said hey buddy if youre going to give me a free meal how about bobby flays or seablue dont send me to the trough like a pig theyre discriminating against me because im obese
151286 he told me to go up to my room and take a shower
151287 i was pristine when i came in it wasnt like i was working on a garbage truck and just walked in i wasnt a rose but i didnt smell like a skunk
151288 ive always been treated decently there but this was right out of left field
151289 they could have handled this in a much more businesslike manner
151290 contemporary art museums have evolved as public institutions no longer are they dusty repositories for two dimensional art rather they are vibrant interactive spaces that capture 21st century imagination
151291 it is wonderful that cayman is taking the development of its indigenous art so seriously as seen by the works of local artists on display
151292 we are extremely pleased with the amount of interest and personal dedication shown from such a diverse group of participants including those from information technology enterprise risk management internal audit premises project management office and fund services
151293 there were 25 participants in total and 14 of those took the exam to become certified
151294 this is an incredible accomplishment and we could not be more impressed with all the participants
151295 at butterfield our staff are the greatest assets we have and we continually invest in their education and training as we believe that well trained people provide us with the best possible return on that investment
151296 the dedication they are showing will improve each of their careers and benefit the bank for years to come
151297 there really arent many green spaces in town so if we got the opportunity of having one at this location it would definitely be environmentally valuable but also i think people would appreciate it
151298 no definite decisions have been made in respect to what will be done with the former tower building location a temporary parking lot could also go there the long term plans will be decided in what i hope will be in the very near future
151299 a green area is one of the proposals but at this point things are just being discussed the next step is for the government to decide what should happen to the spot
151300 in building this project government will be able to bring together under one roof a number of its core functions and services which will result in improved delivery of services to our clients and the cayman islands public
151301 if we did not construct this new building and the status quo remained it is anticipated that by 2013 government would be paying 10 million a year in accommodation costs for the agencies that will be moving into goap with a construction cost of 85 million it is clear to me that this project makes good financial sense
151302 although he relishes the opportunity to fully service an antique pocket watch no job is too big or small for mr grunenfelder
151303 whether it be the reconditioning of a classic chronograph or simply changing a watch battery every customer is left satisfied with the highest standards of craftsmanship and attention to detail
151304 the iosa registration is especially meaningful to cayman airways and its employees safety has always been and will continue to be our top priority
151305 compliance with iosa standards and recommended practices builds on our existing system of rigorous safety policies procedures and processes
151306 the continued support of cifsa through the increasing number in members shows that many local companies would like to be actively involved in promoting our jurisdiction
151307 bic is very pleased to support the efforts of the cayman islands financial services association
151308 we have been very impressed over the years with the proactive stance cifsa has taken to communicate the quality and integrity of the financial community and we are particularly impressed with their local education campaign
151309 associate members on the other hand are those who wish to support cifsa but are not a financial service provider or a financial services provider not based in cayman
151310 i am delighted that we were able to make this arrangement and preserve an excellent part of our heritage
151311 the preservation of miss lassies house is the most significant cultural achievement in caymans recent cultural history and i thank government for making it happen
151312 can hold office in or be an employee of a political party or hold a position in central or local government elective or otherwise
151313 foi is a law for the people and if they dont access it or own the process it will languish
151314 this position is high profile and the person appointed will need to have integrity and honesty objectivity impartiality and independence are also vital qualities
151315 from the start the hallmark of creating caymans freedom of information legislation has been public inclusion and government has made every effort to make residents part of the process
151316 i urge you to take yet another opportunity to open the doors of government by nominating a candidate for the post of information commissioner
151317 the information commissioner will be the guardian of your right to know and in making your nomination you must be mindful of the importance of this task
151318 while there might be some debate on whether or not freedom of information can be termed a basic human right i do believe that more than any other law the foi law belongs to the people
151319 freedom of information legislation is an important anti corruption tool that tests the legitimacy of elected governments and those who hold public office
151320 these benefits can only become a reality if the public makes foi requests if you want freedom of information to work you must find individual and collective voices to take on the responsibility of asking your government the tough questions
151321 i urge you to take the time to educated yourself on the provisions and significance of the foi law it is important that you know how to access the information so you can use the law to your or your communitys advantage whenever needed
151322 your active involvement is necessary because foi legislation is fundamentially different from other laws it is implemented by the people and not by government
151323 were excited to finally deliver a great radio product dedicated to the residents of the sister islands
151324 our focus is on content relevant to the people of the sister islands
151325 we are thrilled to have introduced the new station extending our broadcasting services across the country the new 96 5 fm station is the latest edition to the dms broadcasting family a family that never stops growing

151327 i am extremely grateful to dms for assisting me in funding my final year of studies and supporting me in my career development
151328 i am looking forward to returning to dms with the new skills i have obtained and bringing them to the workplace
151329 dms is deeply committed to supporting the training and development of caymanians it is very rewarding to witness this commitment come to fruition as mr davis returns to us having obtained the education and skills which will make him even more valuable to our company
151330 we are very proud of mr davis and would like to take his opportunity to congratulate him and welcome him home
151331 although stuart jennings was caymans only representative in this years hiho with the wonderful windsurfing conditions that exist in cayman it is only a matter of time before we see more youngsters following stuarts example
151332 perhaps for hihos 25th anniversary next year in 2009 and with the right sponsorship cayman might even send a team to compete
151333 it was the perfect set up for the 15 18 knot winds we had all week
151334 we enjoy seeing so many people from all over the world travel to the bvi to attend the event
151335 section 5 of the health practice law 2005 revision requires a certificate to be issued by the health practice commission in order to operate a health care facility
151336 to date the health practice commission and councils have no application from staffpointe or am pm house calls to operate a health care facility or practise in the cayman islands
151337 as the regulatory body we have conducted a search but we have not been successful in obtaining any meaningful information on the said company
151338 the company works with all of the local governing and professional regulatory agencies wherever it establishes a branch of the company these coordinated efforts also usually involve the tourism governmental entities since a large percentage of am pm patients are travelers
151339 gave the impression that they havent done their homework and think cayman is a backwater
151340 when am pm enters a new territory or destination in which to provide services it recruits local doctors and local business partners or owners the company is reaching out to doctors in the cayman islands to determine interest in bringing the am pm house calls concept to the cayman islands
151341 upon receiving a call the call is triaged to determine if it is appropriate for a house call doctor or if it is a hospital emergency in which case an ambulance is called on behalf of the caller
151342 operates as a fee for service and provides a full medical report for patients to seek reimbursement from their own insurance for the fees
151343 to ensure there will be compliance with the health practice law 2005 revision and the health practice registration regulations 2005 revision
151344 the silver lining to the dark cloud of the attack on the animals is that it has created a lot of national and international interest in the breeding programme now most of the adults have been sponsored and we are fielding queries every day
151345 it is a myth that currently there are no appointments available until next year many thousands of dates for the balance of calendar year 2008 from september onward will be released in due course
151346 the consular section is working at full capacity with the resources allotted by the us state department since october 1 2007 more than 86 000 nonimmigrant visa interviews have been conducted with an approval rate of over 60 percent
151347 the embassy adds thousands of new appointments each month via the visa appointment website
151348 embassy regularly opens appointments on the department of states worldwide online system which is an electronic calendar that shows available dates and times the number of appointments made available is closely linked to anticipated staffing and overall capacity both of which can vary depending on reassignments illnesses and unpredictable events like severe weather
151349 provide the exact physical address of the location where the complaint is taking place including the house number and street address the block and parcel number and the owners name if possible
151350 we deal with many different types of complaints on a daily basis and we try to resolve each complaint within 48 hours or less but if callers do not have the exact address our response time will be tremendously delayed
151351 basically we assist with anything in the environment that affects your health
151352 the department really appreciates the publics assistance with the elimination of such nuisances

151371 i think we are recognizable but we have not truly gained the respect nationally of a team thats going to be there every year
151372 year 2 is about consistency and performance year 1 youve got to get on the map youve got to get everybodys attention now its like what have you got
151373 where you dont know whats going to happen of course it would be a little bit of a letdown this is my last season as an athlete you want to play naturally but i would not let that hurt the team or show at all i would support him as much as i can so that we can win games
151374 we will do what we do better in year 2 than we did in year 1
151375 were a little bit faster a little bit more diverse
151376 theres a lot more flexibility in terms of personnel than we had last year
151377 we can do a lot of things move some people around which is pretty exciting to me from an offensive standpoint it still comes down to the ability to run the football
151378 i think we are recognizable but we have not truly gained the respect nationally of a team thats going to be there every year
151379 year 2 is about consistency and performance year 1 youve got to get on the map youve got to get everybodys attention now its like what have you got

151381 we will do what we do better in year 2 than we did in year 1
151382 were a little bit faster a little bit more diverse
151383 theres a lot more flexibility in terms of personnel than we had last year

151393 my purpose of being here is to promote the theme for the club this year make dreams real the symbol on our flag denotes a person holding a child and this is the primary focus of each member of the club to embrace the children of the sister island communities and guide them to a brighter future
151394 the focus of rotary this year is on four critical areas water health and hunger literacy and child mortality promoting clean and safe water for consumption is of great importance and the club will be dedicated to enhancing water projects to safeguarding all the inhabitants of the land including marine life
151395 rotary will provide haiti with one million meals between now and the middle of november
151396 the club will do everything to their ability to help curtail this problem as most of the diseases killing the children are preventable ones
151397 i know that the club of cayman brac is a small one but they have been doing a wonderful job
151398 this should not be an excuse for the club not growing and getting new members in
151399 with the short time i have spent with the governor his vision for the club is phenomenal even though we are a small club the members support the motto service above self and are working assiduously to complete all the projects that are on the table
151400 il est certain quil ne sagit pas pour les deux parties dun accord qui a t atteint sans douleur
151401 i have been on the island for three and a half years working for the ritz carlton in engineering when i first came on the island in 2004 i played for tigers football club and then i started refereeing now i have been refereeing for almost three years here in cayman
151402 i then played for churchill brother sports club which were runner up in 2002 then fransa football club

151404 my favourite sport is football and i like watching cricket
151405 when will local politicians learn that you cannot run an international financial sector like you run a corner store
151406 i wouldnt want to live there for my weight in gold
151407 when you go to sea its for a year and when you come back your children are afraid of you
151408 i could make a lot more money at sea but i wanted to stay home and the children were glad of that
151409 upon reaching home my intent is get a lot of food and have a feast with family members and friends
151410 i was inspired to do this album to prove that i could also sing reggae and soca as i am more known for singing rock n roll music
151411 i just wanted to prove that this could be done locally to inspire future brac singers to follow my footsteps to me its like breaking ground and paving the way
151412 my greatest appreciation to vernon and jeremy smith for their musical talent and allowing me to use their backyard studio
151413 brackers residing in grand cayman and would like a copy can call me at 925 9466
151414 this is truly a chance to support and encourage a local talent so that our island can be known for positive and unique musical artistry
151415 eco art involves using things that would normally be thrown away being transformed to bring an artistic flavour to life
151416 art is what you perceive it to be some people may have an attraction for certain art work but find others distasteful the beauty of art is using your imagination to create something unique and perhaps unusual in the sight of others
151417 this summer it was artist aston ebanks who many know in grand cayman as the creator of the giant maze in which he used whole shipping pallets an item most people discard to the dump after they have taken off their goods and he made the huge maze
151418 the kids learnt that art can be made from anything not necessarily paper or canvas with paint or pencil in this case it was items found on the beach like empty juice boxes that were transformed into bird feeders so in part it was a recycling project as well
151419 through the programme children are encouraged to read for information inspiration connections and perspectives and most importantly for enjoyment when children read what they enjoy and learn to love reading in the end they become better readers
151420 children read and share books with others while joining in fun activities and events there were lots of new books to read while participants also enjoyed art and craft storytelling special presentations on line games contests and prizes
151421 how to make the family stronger with emphasis placed on the financial spiritual social and emotional aspects of the family
151422 the emotional well being of each family member influences the stability of the whole family love in the family cannot grow without expression
151423 with a population of only 200 residents there are many old abandoned vehicles that are towed to the dump
151424 notwithstanding the island does not have many motor vehicle accidents hence it is surmised that the growing number of vehicles taken to the dump are vehicles that have been discarded by owners for whatever reasons soon we will have a mountain of metal if something is not done soon to export all of this metal off island for it to be recycled
151425 currently a tender is out for companies to submit their application for the process to continue
151426 the aim now is to get things sorted out as quickly as possible as everyone is cognizant of the negative effects of metal on the environment
151427 its such a relatively new field that its very hard for people to understand it that you can take a very small catheter and snake it into the brain
151428 im like a cardiologist except instead of going to the heart i go to the head
151429 back then there werent many things we were treating for a cure
151430 we were treating things to make it easier to treat with other methods
151431 our goal is to disconnect the aneurysm from the parent circulation

151436 i would make a very good miss teen cayman islands because i am ready to take on the challenge i am a good example of a teenager that really wants something else to do in the cayman islands besides just going out and about
151437 i think i should win miss teen cayman islands because i am a confident person and i am pretty well rounded so i think i would represent our country very well because i am beautiful intelligent and i am concerned about our country
151438 i would make a good miss teen because im confident intelligent and a young lady who is willing to respect love and show honesty at all times no matter where i go
151439 i feel i have the responsibility and the ideas that are needed
151440 i would be a good role model for all teens in the cayman islands because i have good moral values
151441 i have made appearances at numerous events including the young caymanian leadership awards which was held last year and have made speeches to the middle schools about the benefits of community involvement ive donated to both the paediatric ward and the programme generation now and i am very grateful to know i have fulfilled just about 99 percent of my duties
151442 tonight it is really just a celebration of taking people down memory lane and getting to know a bit more of the history as to how the miss teen contest came about and then introducing our seven new contestants for this years contest
151443 but i said slavery with young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 years old boys and bring them to the big clubs this is in my expression this is modern slavery

151458 following discussions the ioc has held with the organizers of the beijing 2008 olympic games on the difficulties experienced this week in accessing some web sites the ioc is pleased to see that the issues are quickly being resolved
151459 the ioc has always encouraged the beijing 2008 organizers to provide media with the fullest access possible to report on the games including access to the internet knowing this is important for them to do their job
151460 beijing organizers will honor the promise to the ioc to provide sufficient access
151461 at the moment the channel for reporters to use the internet is fully open
151462 this is a great opportunity for us to show chinese readers what first class journalism we can deliver but of course we will also want to check if the site is still available after the olympics have ended
151463 however arbitrary blocking and unblocking of certain sites does not fulfill the duty to comply with international standards of freedom of information and expression
151464 we continue to urge the authorities to ensure unfettered access to the internet in line with official olympic promises of complete media freedom and international human rights standards
151465 the company had an outstanding first year and held a party at the house of lords to celebrate a decade later i felt we could only match that by coming nearer to home and the serenity of st johns i actually cant believe the firm is 10 years old i still get a buzz when a client achieves a particular landmark such as their first recruit re sale or national conference
151466 i am delighted to be able to meet the children and find out what they do in this class
151467 it has such an important role to play in developing childrens confidence and their ability to learn i would like to see this kind of initiative in more schools
151468 i categorically and vehemently deny the allegations of court of appeals justice jose sabio that i was waiting in a car while he was allegedly meeting with francis de borja on july 1 2008 at the ateneo law school in rockwell
151469 mind you i do not have the habit of waiting in a car for anybody except for my wife
151470 we have retainers and lawyers to handle the legal matter further francis is not a lawyer nor is he connected with the company
151471 the lopez family is not in the business of bribing people in the pursuit of its businesses or to win cases in court
151472 we met several setbacks in the past and thats the way it is you know you cant win all of your cases and when you lose you set to abide by the law we comply right away
151473 i repeat i categorically deny any involvement in this matter
151474 he sabio should not worry about the fears that he expressed this morning in his press conference
151475 maybe one day we will bump into each other because we have many mutual friends and so yes one day we will find out the entire story one of these days but i dont see the urgency right now
151476 maybe he feels for what is happening to my family
151477 crush the rebels once and for all because they are trying to impede the growth of our country
151478 our decision does not mean we disregard the seriousness of the incident
151479 i feel terrible when i give a thought to how the victim feels we will work hard with member schools nationwide to prevent any recurrence of this kind of incident
151480 in a difficult financial environment the downward trend in cnp assurances premium income observed in the first quarter slowed in the second despite intense competition from easy access savings products i am also very satisfied with our highly positive performance in brazil based on the groups solid fundamentals we expect first half profit attributable to equity holders of the parent to be stable and are maintaining our full year target of double digit growth in attributable recurring profit

151491 if you dont fall for the joke you get to be in on it
151492 lulz is watching someone lose their mind at their computer 2 000 miles away while you chat with friends and laugh
151493 you look for someone who is full of it a real blowhard then you exploit their insecurities to get an insane amount of drama laughs and lulz rules would be simple 1 do whatever it takes to get lulz 2 make sure the lulz is widely distributed this will allow for more lulz to be made 3 the game is never over until all the lulz have been had

151500 leading on confused people why dont people fact check who this stuff is coming from why do they assume its true
151501 a normal person who does insane things on the internet
151502 do you know how many ive killed at his command
151503 hacks like this tell you to watch out by hitting you with a baseball bat
151504 demonstrating these kinds of exploits is usually the only way to get them fixed
151505 so the message is buy a helmet and the medium is a bat to the head
151506 no its like a pitcher telling a batter to put on his helmet by beaning him from the mound if you have this disease and youre on the internet you need to take precautions
151507 i look in the mirror i see my hair is black
151508 thats uh interesting i guess you understand that you have green hair about as well as you understand that youre a terrible reporter
151509 why didnt you get so defensive when i said you had green hair
151510 you seem to know exactly how much you can get away with and you troll right up to that line

151512 i want everyone off the internet bloggers are filth they need to be destroyed blogging gives the illusion of participation to a bunch of retards we need to put these people in the oven
151513 plankton levels are dropping bees are dying there are tortilla riots in mexico the highest wheat prices in 30 odd years
151514 the question we have to answer is how do we kill four of the worlds six billion people in the most just way possible
151515 we need someone to show us the way the messiah
151516 loki was a hacker the other gods feared him but they needed his tools
151517 be conservative in what you do be liberal in what you accept from others
151518 while drews conduct is immoral it is a very big stretch to call it illegal
151519 people know to be deeply skeptical of what they read on the front of a supermarket tabloid
151520 it should be even more so with anonymous comments they shouldnt start off with a credibility rating of say 0 it should be more like negative 30
151521 but i can look at you while youre burning in the fire and not be required to help
151522 allows me to find people who do stupid things and turn them around zach asked if i thought i could turn my parents around i almost broke down the idea of them learning from their mistakes and becoming people that i could actually be proud of it was overwhelming
151523 its not that i do this because i hate them i do this because im trying to save them
151524 ultimately the power lies in the community to dictate its own standards
151525 what makes a bad person or a good person how do you know if youre a bad person
151526 a good person is someone who follows the rules a bad person is someone who doesnt
151527 there is no morality only the right of the superior to rule over the inferior

151530 all that part of the western territory which either by actual possession or through the submission of the indian proprietors was subjected to the jurisdiction of the king of great britain till it was relinquished in the treaty of peace
151531 by actual possession or through the submission of the indian proprietors
151532 d elinquencies in payment would result from a diversity of causes the real deficiency of resources the mismanagement of their finances and in addition to the rest the reluctance with which men commonly part with money for purposes that have outlived the exigencies which produced them and interfere with the supply of immediate wants
151533 america if not connected at all or only by the feeble tie of a simple league offensive and defensive would by the operation of such opposite and jarring alliances be gradually entangled in all the pernicious labyrinths of european politics and wars and by the destructive contentions of the parts into which she was divided would be likely to become a prey to the artifices and machinations of powers equally the enemies of them all divide et impera must be the motto of every nation that either hates or fears us
151534 if their works betray imperfections we wonder at the fewness of them if they erred most in the structure of the union this was the work most difficult to be executed this is the work which has been new modelled by the act of your convention and it is that act on which you are now to deliberate and decide
151535 humans are different like snowflakes one is not better than the other
151536 hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you that the people of america knit together as they are by so many cords of affection can no longer live together as members of the same family can no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness can no longer be fellow citizens of one great respectable and flourishing empire hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the political world that it has never yet had a place in the theories of the wildest projectors that it rashly attempts what it is impossible to accomplish no my countrymen shut your ears against such unhallowed language
151537 which has no parallel in the annals of human society
151538 not to your doubts and fears but to your greatest hopes
151539 the solid conclusions drawn from the natural and necessary progress of human affairs
151540 war would be desultory and predatory plunder and devastation ever march in the train of irregulars the calamities of individuals would make the principal figure in the events which would characterize our military exploits
151541 the states would be necessitated to strengthen the executive arm of government in doing which their constitutions would acquire a progressive direction toward monarchy it is of the nature of war to increase the executive at the expense of the legislative authority
151542 insufficiency of the present confederation to the preservation of the union
151543 if the road over which you will still have to pass should in some places appear to you tedious or irksome you will recollect that you are in quest of information on a subject the most momentous which can engage the attention of a free people that the field through which you have to travel is in itself spacious
151544 we may indeed with propriety be said to have reached almost the last stage of national humiliation there is scarcely anything that can wound the pride or degrade the character of an independent nation which we do not experience is respectability in the eyes of foreign powers a safeguard against foreign encroachments the imbecility of our government even forbids them to treat with us is a violent and unnatural decrease in the value of land a symptom of national distress is private credit the friend and patron of industry that most useful kind which relates to borrowing and lending is reduced within the narrowest limits and this still more from an opinion of insecurity than from the scarcity of money
151545 why has government been instituted at all because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice without constraint has it been found that bodies of men act with more rectitude or greater disinterestedness than individuals the contrary of this has been inferred by all accurate observers of the conduct of mankind and the inference is founded upon obvious reasons regard to reputation has a less active influence when the infamy of a bad action is to be divided among a number than when it is to fall singly upon one a spirit of faction which is apt to mingle its poison in the deliberations of all bodies of men will often hurry the persons of whom they are composed into improprieties and excesses for which they would blush in private capacity
151546 that mankind would have been obliged at length to live constantly under the government of a single person had they not contrived a kind of constitution that has all the internal advantages of a republican together with the external force of a monarchical government
151547 this form of government is a convention by which several smaller states agree to become members of a larger one which they intend to form
151548 a republic of this kind able to withstand an external force may support itself without any internal corruptions the form of this society prevents all manner of inconveniences
151549 if a single member should attempt to usurp the supreme authority he could not be supposed to have an equal authority and credit in all the confederate states
151550 should a popular insurrection happen in one of the confederate states the others are able to quell it
151551 as this government is composed of small republics it enjoys the internal happiness of each and with respect to its external situation it is possessed by means of the association of all the advantages of large monarchies
151552 were i to give a model of an excellent confederate republic it would be that of lycia
151553 listen to you and learn from you even when we disagree
151554 hope is what led a band of revolutionaries to rise up against an empire
151555 when montesquieu recommends a small extent for republics the standards he had in view were of dimensions far short of the limits of almost every one of these states neither virginia massachusetts pennsylvania new york north carolina nor georgia can by any means be compared with the models from which he reasoned and to which the terms of his description apply if we therefore take his ideas on this point as the criterion of truth we shall be driven to the alternative either of taking refuge at once in the arms of monarchy or of splitting ourselves into an infinity of little jealous clashing tumultuous commonwealths the wretched nurseries of unceasing discord and the miserable objects of universal pity or contempt
151556 a firm union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the states as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection
151557 by a faction i understand a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or a minority of the whole who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion or of interest adversed to the rights of other citizens or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community
151558 there are again two methods of removing the causes of faction the one by destroying the liberty which is essential to its existence the other by giving to every citizen the same opinions the same passions and the same interests
151559 the latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man a zeal for different opinions concerning religion concerning government and many other points as well of speculation as of practice an attachment to different leaders ambitiously contending for pre eminence and power or to persons of other descriptions whose fortunes have been interesting to the human passions have in turn divided mankind into parties inflamed them with mutual animosity and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co operate for their common good so strong is this propensity of mankind to fall into mutual animosities that where no substantial occasion presents itself the most frivolous and fanciful distinctions have been sufficient to kindle their unfriendly passions and excite their most violent conflicts
151560 those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society those who are creditors and those who are debtors fall under a like discrimination a landed interest a manufacturing interest a mercantile interest a moneyed interest with many lesser interests grow up of necessity in civilized nations and divide them into different classes actuated by different sentiments and views
151561 there are two methods of curing the mischiefs of faction the one by removing its causes the other by controlling its effects the inference to which we are brought is that the causes of faction cannot be removed and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its effects the two great points of difference between a democracy and a republic are first the delegation of the government in the latter to a small number of citizens elected by the rest secondly the greater number of citizens and greater sphere of country over which the latter may be extended the effect of the first difference is on the one hand to refine and enlarge the public views by passing them through the medium of a chosen body of citizens whose wisdom may best discern the true interest of their country and whose patriotism and love of justice will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary or partial considerations under such a regulation it may well happen that the public voice pronounced by the representatives of the people will be more consonant to the public good than if pronounced by the people themselves convened for the purpose
151562 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and knowledge of the holy one is understanding
151563 all of which are accorded to man over and over in the bible no surprises then when men act badly
151564 what does their choice tell us about human beings these founders tend to take a pretty dim view of human nature can you blame them
151565 everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities for there is no authority except that which god has established the authorities that exist have been established by god
151566 for rulers hold no terror for those who do right but for those who do wrong
151567 guess what god spoke to me again last night hold on let me remember what god said the lord said joseph you are to take many virgin wives and emma smith can you hear me if you sleep with another man i will burn you in hell so help me emma thats what god said im just the messenger
151568 number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole who are united and actuate by some common impulse of passion or of interest adverse to the rights of other citizens or to the permanent or aggregate interests of the community
151569 as long as the reason of man continues fallible and he is at liberty to exercise it different opinions will be formed as long as the connection subsists between his reason and his self love his opinions and his passions will have a reciprocal influence on each other and the former will be objects to which the latter will attach themselves a zeal for different opinions concerning religion has divided mankind into parties inflamed them with mutual animosity and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each other than to co operate for their common good
151570 if the impulse and the opportunity be suffered to coincide we well know that neither moral nor religious motives can be relied on as an adequate control they are not found to be such on the injustice and violence of individuals and lose their efficacy in proportion to the number combined together that is in proportion as their efficacy becomes needful
151571 christianity and nothing else is the ultimate foundation of liberty conscience human rights and democracy the benchmarks of western civilization we continue to nourish ourselves from this source
151572 god would not order somebody stoned to death for a so called crime that they did not commit
151573 it is critical to keep in mind that the founders sought to escape centuries of history in which religious majorities had oppressed tortured and murdered individuals and minority groups in the name of god and the christian bible
151574 disagree with my claim that christian faith stays the hand of the would be oppressor
151575 let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion

151696 when seattle wanted to trade him cincinnati was the only team to which he wanted to go
151697 he received threats to kill his family kidnap his kids when his family didnt show up at games on time to start the game i could see his demeanor change he didnt care about the game you could see it in his face he wasnt the same until his family showed up at the game
151698 thats why he never wanted pictures taken of melissa his wife or the kids and can you blame him
151699 people have no idea what he went through in his career
151700 the first time he broke his hand in seattle it was bad man i thought he might miss two years they put a plate in his hand and he was back in six weeks then a screw came loose in the plate and he screwed it back in himself
151701 im proud of what he did and he doesnt owe anybody anything
151702 i know what he went through there is no doubt in my mind that without the injuries he would be right there with barry bonds right now in home runs no doubt
151703 because i know the direction of the team and i can see in the minors whats coming up
151704 i told him he had a great eight year run in cincinnati nothing to apologize for with the injuries it was amazing he reached 600 homers a great accomplishment i told him the only thing he didnt have was the ring and that he should go for it the white sox have a chance to get him that ring

151711 i was successful because i threw first pitch strikes these guys are aggressive early in the count its essentially the same knuckleball i had when i left here ive gained a lot of experience between that time and this time before it was kind of throw and hope i couldnt control it
151712 we believe were definitely going to have to hit more in the second half than we hit in the first half
151713 i had posters of that guy when i was growing up
151714 i think its going to be an awesome thing to have him here not just because of the way he plays the game but his leadership abilities
151715 he comes here to play every day no doubt about it
151716 but we are here to win and we see how it works
151717 when i talked to junior he was very honest and thats what we want from our players
151718 he said i have to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
151719 through it all the most ironic thing i think is we have had more confidence and more faith in him turning it around than he probably has well continue to do that
151720 im in a bad mood i dont want to be in a good mood no signing hymns
151721 i go to church and i love to hear hymns

151786 the us decision to abstain is clearly a vote against giving president al beshir a get out of jail free card
151787 this attempt to halt the iccs work is blatant political interference with an independent court

151806 wasas compliance with federal water safety standards at this point depends on cleaning peoples lead service lines and pipes the night before they sample for lead
151807 if youre gone for the weekend then the lead levels would typically be higher
151808 we want to get samples that represent the same premise that water has sat in the pipe for at least six to eight hours
151809 if you wanted to find a lead problem this is not what you would do
151810 if you wanted to hide a lead problem this is what you would do
151811 it removes all traces of lead that would come from the lead service line

151820 vemos estrellas en nuestra galaxia que tienen propiedades muy diferentes a las de nuestro sol y es posible que sean estrellas de la segunda generaci n

151840 distort scripture with their tongues and they knowingly tell a lie against god
151841 it is of course problematic today when tolerance and pluralism are so sorely needed for scriptural texts to denigrate other religions and their believers
151842 but this is a common phenomenon among scriptures negative assessments and even condemnation of prior religions and their adherents occur in all three scriptures of judaism christianity and islam
151843 this rejection became a very serious issue for the muslims because the jews were known and respected by the arabs as a wise and ancient community of monotheists with a long prophetic tradition
151844 their rejection of muhammad thus represented a major blow to his authority in medina not only as a prophet but as a leader in general
151845 tendency on both sides to see the situation in simplistic terms
151846 reinforces negative stereotypes that are not accurate reflections of reality
151847 unacceptable in an enlightened democratically governed society that supported equal rights and privileges for all religious communities
151848 yet nowhere do we find such an accusation used for subjugation and maltreatment
151849 jihad is not to be invoked for the purpose of forcing non muslims to convert to islam through force of arms

151856 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities

151862 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
151863 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
151864 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
151865 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
151866 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
151867 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
151868 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
151869 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
151870 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
151871 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
151872 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
151873 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
151874 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

152023 we started out in paris where jon brion inspired us to create first and think later
152024 we took the night train to berlin where everything came together in an avalanche of experimentation that took us all by surprise and where we made a pact with stuart price to ignore the rules of good taste
152025 weve hidden ourselves away in the depths of the english countryside recorded a new track in london at the last possible moment and now were in los angeles tying up the loose ends

152064 heute wissen wir auch warum laut einem interview in der wochenzeitschrift format habe es n mlich bereits vor der hauptversammlung gespr che gegeben die laut w rtlicher aussage von hans haider in eine fusion oder ein kaufangebot f r eine gewisse anzahl von aktien m nden
152065 diese aussagen lassen nur den schluss zu dass all jene zweifelhaften aktientransaktionen die in den tagen vor der hauptversammlung mit unterst tzung von board mitgliedern und des externen investment managers karl heinz grasser sowie beteiligter fianzdienstleister und investmentbanken stattfanden m glicherweise insidertransaktionen waren
152066 all diese umst nde wurden den streubesitzaktion ren verheimlicht es ist davon auszugehen dass die zust ndigen aufsichtsbeh rden diesen pl tzlichen strategiewechsel des mip boards und die damit zusammenh ngenden umst nde entsprechend pr fen und bewerten der vorwurf die unabh ngigen aktion re seien nur heuschrecken und wollten das unternehmen seiner eigenst ndigkeit berauben richtet sich nun endg ltig gegen jene die diesen vorwurf erhoben haben
152067 wir m ssen mit der strafm ndigkeit hinunter da die heutigen jugendlichen berwiegend viel fr her reifer werden in erster linie geht es dabei um pr vention und schutz und es geht darum den jugendlichen vor augen zu f hren dass eine strafbare handlung kein spa ist im einzelfall muss dabei aber auch auf die pers nliche reife des jugendlichen bedacht genommen werden
152068 im jugendstrafrecht enthaltene betreuungsma nahmen wie etwa diversion schuldspruch ohne strafe oder sozialarbeit sollten in diesen f llen anwendung finden das geht aber nur wenn vorher eine strafrechtliche verantwortlichkeit gegeben ist
152069 die aktuelle kriminalit tsstatistik belegt dass immer mehr jugendliche an vielen gewalttaten beteiligt sind daher muss auch das jugendstrafrecht entsprechend adaptiert werden ein h rteres vorgehen muss daher platz greifen und kriminelle jugendliche m ssen daher fr her zur verantwortung gezogen und angemessen bestraft werden
152070 sp justizministerin maria berger und die wechselnden vp innenminister haben bisher der explodierenden jugendkriminalit t tatenlos zugesehen und sich mehr um die schicksale der t ter als die der opfer gek mmert jetzt wie sp und vp leere wahlversprechen abzugeben ist einfach zuwenig

152088 big brown is the story and rightfully so and we hope our horses come to play and see what happens
152089 from what happened in his last start its kind of hard to feel as confident as i was for the derby and those other races
152090 but i feel as confident as i can be that hes going to run his race
152091 im still kind of concerned about whats going to happen sunday because i know the horse went into the belmont in very good condition and whatever happened in that race i have no idea
152092 but if it happens again then im going to know something is wrong with him hes just not going to run anymore stuff like that you know
152093 he could be better than the big brown leading up to the kentucky derby
152094 we are very excited to see him come into the race the right way we could not be happier with the way he is doing i think he is a horse that has captured the imagination of racing and to see him perform so poorly in the belmont was so disappointing to the horse
152095 he shining hes happy you know if he wasnt going into this race as good as he could go into a race we would wait on the next spot but hes on top of his game hes doing great he looks great so i have to say that everything is all good
152096 its on a mud flat at the moment and we are trying to get closer to it
152097 its flapping its tail and moving its head so its still with us its a case of waiting until the tide rises to hopefully get it back into the water

152099 its really a race against time once the whale is in the water we dont have much control over it and it will go where it wants to

152103 vmware esxi delivers dramatically quicker and easier installation of virtual appliances this enables our customers to deploy altor s virtual network analysis and security solutions even faster giving them instant visibility into their virtual network activity said amir ben efraim chief executive officer of altor networks with vmware esxi accelerating the pace of virtual appliance deployments in the datacenter the demand for virtual network firewalls also accelerates we are excited to be a vmware partner and support vmware esxi across our products simplifying the delivery and deployment of catbird s v agent virtual appliance via the open virtualization format ovf and vmware esxi is a terrific component of our goal of ensuring catbird customers have instant easy to use protection and compliance for their virtual environments
152104 the vmware virtual appliance marketplace is a great vehicle for our appliance and is a user friendly high value place to shop companies are rapidly deploying virtualization technology because of its clear financial benefits however the potential security threats are often overlooked said juliette sultan head of global marketing at check point software technologies our vpn 1 security solution fully supports vmware esxi implementations so customers can protect the data communication on their virtual networks with the same proven security used to protect their physical networks by utilizing the open virtualization format ovf for our virtual appliance mindtouch deki becomes even easier for customers to test drive and use
152105 the ability to easily import and deploy our virtual appliance with vmware esxi means fewer troubleshooting issues and a higher adoption rate two keys to advancing deki in the marketplace the spread of vmware esxi will no doubt contribute to the ongoing success of mindtouch deki
152106 vmware esxi represents an opportunity to vastly expand the overall virtualization ecosystem said punit minocha vice president of business development at trend micro business development
152107 vmware esxi confirms vmware s trajectory to keep layering on the breakthroughs said stephen dennis president of virtualappliances
152108 the drop in gasoline prices may be reflecting the more than 20 a barrel drop in crude oil prices since the first week of july when they hit a record of 147 a barrel
152109 it often takes a few weeks for retail prices to catch up to whats happening in the markets but that seems to be the case now
152110 no matter how hard we tried we couldnt shake it free of the scoop and deliver it to the tega
152111 our excitement is not so much that ice is made of h2o
152112 its what were going to learn about the impurities that are associated with this ice salts minerals and all of the things that are going to tell us about the history and the chance that this is a habitable zone on mars
152113 what will pick up the pace for akamai when web video quality increases so akamai can push streams and video files that are relatively larger
152114 but some analysts and competitors say theyre not seeing the same weakness in media and entertainment thats causing some to speculate that akamai is just being coy about competitive pressures that its facing
152115 ive talked to a lot of the cdns and not one of them said were seeing traffic volumes slow
152116 i listen to all of the cdns quarterly calls and have to admit that last night akamai delivered a very confusing message on one hand they said traffic was still growing but not as fast as before and that pricing for cdn remained stable but on the other hand blamed the economy and lack of broadband speeds for the reason content owners are not spending more money to deliver more content which created less growth that does not make sense
152117 you can t have good pricing and traffic growth yet claim a challenging overall economic environment you can only claim a challenging sales environment
152118 was able to grow like a rocket because it really had no viable competition for a long time and that has changed with limelight level 3 at amp t and a plethora of smaller cdns out there fighting for each deal so akamai s growth rate must moderate at least relative to what it would have been and we enter a new more interesting phase in the cdn space
152119 i didnt expect the pullback in guidance and in hindsight i can safely suggest that raising guidance last quarter without having locked in the bag was a dumb arse move had it not done that which got the company very little in terms of stock gains today we d be yawning at another boring quarter and the stock would likely be flat

152122 i like dell i think theyre crazy to think they can beat apple at the ipod game though
152123 im certainly intrigued by their upcoming mini notebooks and their willingness to use linux
152124 we have a dell desktop for the past 3 years and it has been great i have a laptop at work and i hate it so im 50 50
152125 dell is coming around slowly which you would expect they are almost there need another year but quality is coming back

152131 the sco lawsuit raises thorny intellectual property issues and analysts say poses the potential for more court battles as other companies assert rights to some of the communal code
152132 a team at redmond tasked with the assignment of studying the linux phenomena and trying to decipher a way to stop it
152133 you cant take back the fact that someone has tried to claim intellectual property on linux the genie is out of the bottle
152134 linux customers and vendors will be forced to consider their legal liability due to intellectual property issues
152135 the lawsuit represents more than just a licensing squabble between two companies or the efforts of a small unix linux company to dig into the deep pockets of ibm
152136 be forced to consider their legal liability due to intellectual property issues around linux and open source software
152137 some firms will put them linux deployments on hold until they get better clarity
152138 you wont see this thing settled for quite a while
152139 as the two products are integrated we have two or three fairly major products that will be released this fall we believe that solution set will give us a tremendous bridge for our current customer base to move forward on the new platforms
152140 educating people is fairly high on the list of marketing activities they should be engaged in
152141 but when someone makes a decision that theyre going to use linux the question we keep asking is is red hat going to get paid
152142 we continue to believe that the current stock price reflects an overly optimistic view of red hats ability to capitalize on the linux opportunity

152154 you are going to see more airlines go bust if you look around there are a lot of airlines out there that have not been profitable in the past few years those guys will not survive
152155 as hedging unwinds within the industry airlines are going to have to reflect the higher oil price we will have to do something and its not just ba that will have to adjust prices the whole industry will have to we are not reflecting the spot price of oil today what is reflected in our fares is the oil price net of hedging
152156 we are honest and realistic about this in a way that a lot of airlines are not we have asked ourselves the question of what does the industry look like at 150 per barrel and what do we do to be one of the airlines that succeeds in that environment we dont just want to hang in there

152177 long long ago my friend came here for business and introduced me to dakar to sell chinese products
152178 i hope i can make a big market in africa in the future and maybe i will have good luck
152179 these people represent a new form of colonialism with an asian face that is coming to africa
152180 the influx of chinese business people onto the streets of dakar is quite a phenomenon
152181 one street the boulevard general de gaulle named after the french wartime leader could be called boulevard mao tse tung because it is dominated by the chinese
152182 when they came to africa three centuries ago they used the barrel of the gun
152183 they came with boats they controlled ports and forts and physically dominated places the chinese did it in a soft way
152184 the advance force that has allowed opening up of new territories including senegal and they were followed up later on by the big companies and then the political leaders
152185 they are very useful in the grand strategy that china is deploying across the world
152186 well see maybe one two three four maybe more if the market is suitable for me maybe i can stay here for a long time
152187 there is no strategic continental approach that african countries have adopted
152188 no think tank no task force no inclusion of chinese language into universities no coordinated approach this should be the role of the african union
152189 its an unbalanced relationship in which china knows what it wants and has a clearly defined agenda
152190 the question indeed is what is africa doing in the face of these challenges
152191 nothing its as if african countries are rushing to china bowl in hand and china naturally is in a best position to take advantage whereas african countries are almost powerless and just expecting china to be the new messiah
152192 china is in a position to be in the heart of africa
152193 and the west they are losing out if africa plays its cards well i think africa has never been in a better position
152194 the process is a little more democratic today but its awfully awfully competitive
152195 i had a dream that i saw a future event in a piece of lace
152196 its kind of a laugh now because you run into so many things you never anticipated

152201 people who were reading this book were falling in love with it
152202 i thought weve just got to see this through to the end
152203 but its awfully awfully competitive and i wouldnt want anyone to spend their life savings or anything like that saying im going to get

152212 there is only one good knowledge and one evil ignorance
152213 death is not the worst that can happen to men
152214 it is inevitable that people hold divergent views on issues but politicizing the olympics will not address those issues
152215 instead those issues can be resolved on the basis of mutual respect by narrowing the differences and expanding common ground
152216 we will be pleased with the draw logistically holland isnt too far and it will give our fans the opportunity to see the game
152217 as you rightly say its a reunion with steve and we are looking forward to it
152218 when steve was first team coach for the national team and then manager they used to use our training ground at london colney so there are good relations there
152219 im assuming people will say arsenal are one of the strongest seeded teams and he might have been hoping for someone else but thats what the draw brought us and we get on with it
152220 it was a finalist in the aes competition the winner rijndael got 86 votes at the last aes conference while serpent got 59 votes twofish 31 votes rc6 23 votes and mars 13 votes so nists choice of rijndael as the aes was not surprising and we had to content ourselves with silver in the encryption olympics serpent and rijndael are somewhat similar the main difference is that rijndael is faster having fewer rounds but serpent is more secure

152227 if the city police used information passed on by the state police to launch their own investigation then former mayor omalley bears as much responsibility for them as former governor ehrlich has for the state police
152228 this situation has proven that the current system is vulnerable to abuse it isnt enough to say sorry blame it on the last guy and promise it will never happen again there needs to be a law period
152229 even though i did not know about the investigation i accept responsibility for all acts committed under my administration and i am as eager to get to the bottom of it as anyone else
152230 the problem with republican politics in the 21st century is not the ideology of conservatism but leadership that itself is not conservative once we figure out how to fix that republicans will reassume the mantle of ascendancy that we lost when congressional leadership went native a few years back

152257 jokes have varied over the years with some taking the question and answer format while others are witty proverbs or riddles
152258 what they all share however is a willingness to deal with taboos and a degree of rebellion modern puns essex girl jokes and toilet humor can all be traced back to the very earliest jokes identified in this research
152259 it was like something between a dog howling and a baby crying i guess you could say
152260 i dont think it will leave me for a while
152261 i knew he was coming back from the exhibition my brother was supposed to go meet him at the bus depot and he never showed up and then my younger brother and my other brother went to go to his parents place to see if they know anything and they saw a bunch of news people there and then they asked at his parents and thats how we found out
152262 the kids will miss you so much and so will william and i you were a great person always happy and loved and had an amazing personality
152263 tim you were the best guy ever you didnt deserve this at all
152264 what you saw and what you experienced would shake the most seasoned police officer and yet im told that each of you acted swiftly calmly and bravely
152265 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
152266 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
152267 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
152268 we have four baby kittays here that are in need of homes
152269 they arent ready to go home with people yet but they will soon
152270 there doesnt appear to be any indication that were going to have a second half recovery to any great extent
152271 the truth of the matter is the market is adjusting to the fact that now theres significant overcapacity for producing trucks and suvs
152272 theres just far too many trucks and suvs on the road for what americans want to drive
152273 they had the highest percentage of trucks and suvs in their portfolio and they got hit the worst when these vehicles came back from their lease terms
152274 some brands will suffer and see lower lease rates going forward but overall its not a big impact in the short term

152310 physicians today face tougher economic conditions than ever before as they are squeezed between rising costs and stagnant or declining reimbursement
152311 in searching for ways to strengthen their bottom line they need to carefully evaluate any tax savings model they might adopt as in this case if it sounds too good to be true it probably is
152312 physicians need to make sure they thoroughly understand the basis for their valuations and tax positions in these types of sale or consolidation transactions
152313 if anything seems unclear it is best to seek a second opinion
152314 market acceptance and growth in utilization of cardene have been strong in the past several years
152315 we expect the convenience and readiness of the intravenous bags to significantly complement and build upon the market success of the ampoules

152337 we have observed an interesting trend during the first quarter of 2008 namely an expansion in the number of approaches to solve the problem of deploying wireless sensor networks for applications lacking a ready convenient or affordable access to mains power
152338 overall it is clear that there is demand for solutions that manage the energy consumed by a wireless sensor network as the wireless sensor network market matures it is inevitable that demand for low power management will increase significantly
152339 our board of directors believes our cash dividend is an important part of our strategy to build long term shareholder value and this payment marks our 75th consecutive quarter of paying cash dividends

152341 theyve got test ranges in iran which are more than long enough to handle scud launches and even shahab 3 launches
152342 why would they be launching from the surface of the caspian sea they obviously have not explained that to us
152343 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
152344 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
152345 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
152346 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
152347 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
152348 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
152349 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
152350 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
152351 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
152352 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
152353 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
152354 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
152355 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
152356 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
152357 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
152358 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
152359 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
152360 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
152361 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
152362 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
152363 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
152364 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
152365 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
152366 as of today we have no defense against such an attack

152401 our original cohort provides a unique and important group that will help us understand how the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease increase with age and how a persons ethnic background affects this risk
152402 this will also help doctors understand what sort of treatments and preventative measures are best for people of different ethnicities
152403 although i had no health problems when i took part in the study eighteen years ago it is good to have this opportunity to have a thorough health check now
152404 sometimes when youre feeling a bit unwell you wonder if it is something serious so not only do i benefit by taking part but it is good to know that i am helping others by taking part in the research
152405 it was good to have the health check seventeen years ago
152406 the study team contacted me again recently and i have just been along to the clinic to have another health check i enjoyed the day and i was happy to help in something that benefits other people especially since i know a lot of people who have diabetes
152407 before we conducted the original study there were many conflicting reports and gaps in our understanding about how a persons ethnicity affected their health
152408 the study helped inform medical thinking a treatment guidelines and we hope that our follow up study will enhance greatly our understanding
152409 we are delighted to be part funding this study which will undoubtedly reveal some very interesting results nearly seventeen years since the original study
152410 the bhf has a very active programme of health promotion amongst ethnic minority communities and the results of this study will contribute to the evidence we use in order to focus our efforts where they are needed most by understanding what risks are currently faced by different ethnic groups we will be able to target those communities with specific and up to date messages about changing diets and lifestyles

152630 people are looking at the global economic outlook and it appears to be more controlled now
152631 there is no doubt in my mind that the global economy will deteriorate further into recession and oil demand will suffer accordingly
152632 high oil prices are taking their toll on western economies prices are now on a downward trend due to weaker u s economic data

152669 all of a sudden we all heard this scream this bloodcurdling scream
152670 the attacker was standing up right over the top of the guy with a large hunting knife a survival rambo knife holding the guy and continually stabbing him in the chest area
152671 when we came back on the bus he was cutting the guys head off and pretty much gutting him up
152672 he calmly walks up to the front of the bus with the head in his hand and the knife and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of us
152673 there was no rage in him it was just like he was a robot or something
152674 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
152675 at 1 28 a m the suspect attempted to jump out of the bus after breaking a window he was immediately subdued and arrested without incident and is currently in rcmp custody
152676 he didnt do anything to provoke the guy the guy just took a knife out and stabbed him started stabbing him like crazy and cut his head off
152677 some people were puking some people were crying other people were in shock everybody was running screaming off the bus
152678 we were watching zorro next thing i know i hear someone screaming
152679 he came back standing in the doorway with the head looked at him dropped the head and went back and started cutting buddy back up
152680 he come up and picks the head up and hes waving it in the window i just smoked a cigarette with this man earlier like the head hes shaking it back and forth in the window
152681 we were telling him stay put stay put stay there dont try to come out he tried to get the bus working and the bus driver disabled the bus somehow in the back im not sure how he did it and at that point i think the police showed up
152682 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
152683 winnipeg is only a few miles from the u s border
152684 decapitated on a greyhound bus this sounds like something out of a richard laymon novel
152685 i found it scary seeing as how i used to take greyhounds to canada i doubt i ever will again especially now
152686 way to exit the vehicle you panzies sic yesterday when someone opened up shop with a 12 guauge sic shotgun in the pennsylvania he got rushed by multiple people as he was still firing shots
152687 37 people didnt have anything to throw at him 37 people couldnt have over powered one guy with a knife
152688 isnt this the same mentality that allowed 2 or 3 idiots with box cutters to take out the twin towers
152689 they all watched and the bus driver had to ask a trucker to help him keep the guy in the bus
152690 no handguns allowed in canada we know but no woman had a purse to bonk him on the head
152691 no one bothered to throw a can of diet coke at the guys head who was on the bus the old ladies home and gardening society
152692 winnipeg is only a few miles from the u s border
152693 the idea was to get as close to the u s as he could if not get into the u s then engage in the attack in front of a busload of people this was another act of radical islamic terrorism on north american soil
152694 forget london paris or new york the arab gulf is where glamorous hijab is at
152695 and boy do those khaleeji girls know how to rock their shaylas
152696 some people both muslim and non muslim seem to find the notion of hijab fashion and my blog is about style for goodness sake not fashion a contradictory concept
152697 apparently modesty dictates that you look as blah as possible
152698 there is nothing wrong with having a personal sense of style islam does not dictate to us which colours to wear or which hijab wrap is the best
152699 i think its very good to be creative with the hijab
152700 when my non muslim friends and colleagues see me they get very excited they want me to teach them how to tie the different styles

152706 the court is of the opinion that the greek asylum procedure has so many shortcomings that
152707 it seems that greece does not process these asylum applications or does not do it properly
152708 the risk exists that greece is acting in contravention of the refugee convention and the european convention for the protection of human rights the rights attached to these conventions are of such importance that asylum seekers cannot be exposed to the risk
152709 the court ruled that a certain category of asylum seekers cannot be sent back to greece
152710 it is inhuman to leave these people to live here like this
152711 we are sure that organised crime is controlling the whole thing
152712 our geographical designation has been usurped by certain ladies who have no connection whatsoever with lesbos
152713 the claim is based in serious prejudice and hatred a ridiculous claim that most greeks find laughable
152714 however the underlying homophobia and reactionary sentiment is no laughing matter
152715 silence no more if you are not from lesbos you are not a lesbian
152716 while one can understand why the greek authorities might insist on permits for photography in port areas we can only condemn the violence used by the guard when arresting jobard
152717 the authorities have other means at their disposal for carrying out the necessary checks without using methods for which there is no place in the european union
152718 several greek news media have criticised jobard essentially giving only the official version of the incident while jobard may have broken a regulation his investigation into the problems of immigration and what life is like for immigrants deserves support
152719 wir konnten ein ergebnis erreichen dass sich sehen lassen kann
152720 alle beteiligten m ssen mit vernunft in die verhandlungen gehen
152721 aerial photography is a fantastic tool for introducing non technical staff to gis
152722 using blueskys desktop viewing software staff can easily navigate around the imagery and before they know it they are undertaking simple gis analysis in addition the imagery is the perfect compliment to existing map layers and information held with the gis assisting with both day to day business functions and special projects
152723 the bluesky aerial imagery is a valuable resource assisting with data capture survey and asset management applications
152724 the park is facing an exciting yet challenging time and the imagery will help record and manage the parks future development

152731 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
152732 its been very successful and mars had proven itself to be very interesting mechanically the spacecraft is operating great and theres plenty of power margin to carry us beyond the waning summer
152733 with that what id like to do is announce that were going to extend the mission to go till the end of the fiscal year september 30
152734 were looking to understand the history of the ice by trying to figure out if this ice has ever melted and through melting has created a liquid environment that modifies soil
152735 were just getting the data back through this we also hope to resolve questions is this a habitable zone on mars meaning that we have periodic liquid water materials that are the basic ingredients for lifeforms
152736 this is a mystery this is a typically acidic environment perhaps this had to do with a nearby crater

152746 presiden ingin mengetahui secara langsung konstruksi fakta dan konstruksi legal dari masalah tersebut
152747 presiden yudhoyono memang agenda utamanya adalah memberantas korupsi tetapi tetap menjunjung tinggi asas praduga tak bersalah jadi adalah adil ketika yang bersangkutan diberi kesempatan untuk membela diri
152748 kontrak politik itu juga telah ditandatangani kedua menteri tersebut tetapi kalau kita lihat kasus ini terjadi sebelum yang bersangkutan menjadi menteri
152749 kita serahkan ke proses hukum kita hormati praduga tidak bersalah tapi bahwa benar hal itu akan jadi pertimbangan namun tentunya harus melalui proses hukum
152750 kita serahkan ke proses hukum kita hormati asas praduga tidak bersalah karena nanti semua orang bisa sebut nama semaunya
152751 sedangkan apa yang sampaikan oleh hamka yandhu peristiwanya ketika mereka sebelum jadi menteri tetapi apapun ini kita kembalikan ke proses hukum

152773 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight
152774 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged
152775 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
152776 following in depth discussions and after hearing the demands of all sides we deem that the financial conditions allowing a major development in britain by edf have not currently been met
152777 the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular edf deal
152778 i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations
152779 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
152780 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits

152782 since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions we have reduced capacity in the winter schedule without compromising our network and at the same time we have the flexibility in the business to capitalise when conditions improve
152783 we have revised our capital expenditure plans and are focusing on cost control
152784 the markets attention will turn today friday to the release of the us employment report for july
152785 we believe that the report is likely to reinforce the deteriorating labour market trend
152786 we believe that a weaker than expected nfp non farm payrolls report may elicit a similar response to the weaker gdp data suggesting greater downside risks to euro dollar
152787 people are prepared for the worst but it is still going to be pretty ugly
152788 the downturn in the economy is really driving their direction right now they are gong to have to conserve cash wherever they can probably for the next year

152831 it was a time when churchill perceiving the dangers that lay ahead struggled to mobilise the political will and industrial energy of the british empire to meet those dangers he did so often in the face of strong opposition
152832 climate change is the gathering storm of our generation and the implications should we fail to act could be no less dire and perhaps even more so
152833 ive been here before but this is my first time to get to hang out and have fun im going to get in my guinness right after this and ill be staying up late i went for a jog in the park earlier and i was just thinking man it would be great to shoot a movie here its just beautiful im here for two days so im going to make the most of it
152834 i learnt that a good haircut takes some time because usually when i go to get my hair cut i keep yelling at the person hurry up but now i can go oh right do your thing up there
152835 adam and i have worked together 12 years and rob and i have also worked on a bunch of movies so its always a lot of fun
152836 i like ireland so far both hours that ive been here i only got off the plane at five oclock youve got an airport and a hotel and pubs so it looks good so far i think we are going to do another project together me and rob and adam ill make it be in ireland
152837 ive been here a couple of times before and id love to work here as a matter of fact theres a tv show i might be doing here in the future
152838 andrea has proved herself to be one of the most exciting filmmakers to have come out of the uk for years
152839 she received international acclaim for her first feature and her shorts work and we are delighted that we can help her to progress her career
152840 china has been experiencing similar problems during its industrial revolution that western nations saw during their period of rapid growth pollution environmental damage and resource depletion
152841 domestically we are being constrained in many ways we do not have that many natural resources anymore
152842 we have to rely on the international markets so there is a big security concern there
152843 in order to really drive towards a low carbon economy policy incentives are crucial but it is not always the case
152844 the wind sectors fast growth was mainly a result of domestic policies because the government offered incentives to developments so that private and public sector entrepreneurs would jump on it
152845 but the solar pv sector benefitted mainly from the international market such as demand from the
152846 even today the policy incentives are still not there yet it still has grown to the level it is now
152847 in terms of total emissions china is already the worlds biggest emitter
152848 thats publicly available information even the government is not denying it anymore
152849 but if you look at emissions on a per capita basis we are not the biggest emitters because we have 1 3bn people
152850 but just looking at numbers does not help tackle global climate change
152851 in china we are concerned about the speed of growth in emissions it is really scary
152852 if they are not able to do it with the technology available to them then is it reasonable to expect
152853 china does not commit itself to a number and then not deliver
152854 if they commit then they are very very serious about so they have to figure out what is possible
152855 a little bit not actively but its always been in the back of my mind particularly over the last couple of years
152856 i live in london but i havent even been working there much lately ive been in america quite a bit and i really missed ireland its important to me that i get to do irish projects because im very proud of being irish you come to realise that when youre away more so than when youre at home so i was looking to do something the right thing in ireland
152857 elaine is tremendous she is one of the best for a reason
152858 shes really pragmatic and a pleasure to work with for a romantic comedy i think one of the most important things is that the chemistry between the two heroes is there shes really funny and we had quite a tough schedule so its really important that you have someone who is going to just be up for it and ready to go with whatever they throw at you and she was brilliant
152859 it was an absolutely extraordinary experience because you are working with people at the total top of their game
152860 the production values were totally extraordinary they spared no expense on getting the authenticity of the period for a while they even had an etiquette person on set that showed us how to bow and greet a lady and all that kind of stuff the most difficult thing about it was the accent they didnt have what we would call a naturalistic american accent they had a mixture between a devon accent and a half american accent it has already aired in the states and i heard it went down a storm
152861 i believe in diving off the deep end not knowing too much and using your own instinct the ability to be able to listen to what other people are saying is very important too people respond to a truthful moment on screen when something comes alive and i think getting endless amounts of background information is less important
152862 i had an amazing run at the abbey it was just such a brilliant time to learn and i still look back at that as the foundation for whatever has happened since i think having been to drama school can breed a little bit of competitiveness within the industry which i just dont possess i think its really important that we all support each other and whats for you wont go by you
152863 im of the opinion that a bit of theatre is an absolutely brilliant thing for a young actor because theatre is very much the actors medium you learn how to time a laugh how to be confident and walk through a whole play whereas i suppose being on screen you have to give a lot of the power up a lot of the time with film it is made in the editing room so a certain amount of the film is created by the director from an actors point of view the theatre gives you a tremendous amount of confidence
152864 that was really the best experience ive had theatre wise its always been a dream of mine to do a play on broadway and to do it with those people and in a play by david ohare was really amazing the first day of rehearsal i was thinking oh my god because you find yourself in a room with these really really talented people little white lie they have a wonderful tradition on broadway where the critics dont all come on the same night we have a couple of preview weeks where they come in so when the opening night comes they invite the great and the good from new york all these amazing people we had lauren bacall and david bowie if i had known the people that were sitting in the audience beforehand i dont think i would have gone out on stage
152865 when you are a young actor they always say to you dont be too big on screen but then you end up doing this kind of quite bland naturalistic performance i think the most important thing on stage and on film is that you are truthful sometimes were very big and hugely expressive in real life and if thats truthful on screen then thats fine i believe that theres no great method and whatever works for you works for you
152866 the plan is not to have too much of a plan because i think that is the big thing with actors you can get down in between jobs but what ive learned is that the most unexpected things lead to even more unexpected things and you just have to try and be open to things and learn to live with knowing that youre not always going to know where the job is going to take you next i suppose that is the exciting thing about it
152867 i aim to change the world one act of random kindness at a time
152868 i aim to serve my country and all its people in all i do
152869 i aim to champion freedom of speech in britain and abroad
152870 we have announced price increases in europe effective from september of between 8 and 10 in order to offset the input cost price increases
152871 prices have been decreasing in europe for the past seven years while input costs have been rising due to higher oil prices we are positive we will get these price increases because a number of companies have also announced increases and the fact that there has been some bankruptcies and we are gaining market share
152872 we are going to respond to these challenges by continuing to focus on cost control harnessing our buying power through a global procurement drive and through maximising manufacturing efficiencies

152918 hiv develops resistance very rapidly and once that happens drugs dont work as well as they theoretically should or they stop working altogether
152919 physicians routinely have the patients virus tested for resistance in advance of treatment to help make the appropriate clinical decisions
152920 the focus has been on specific areas of the hiv genome where we expect these resistance conferring mutations to occur
152921 we focus on a particular sequence on an important gene from amino acid 1 to 300 and as such we miss roughly a third of this gene until recently most researchers believed that this hidden area was of little clinical significance
152922 the mechanism about how these mutations could be involved in resistance was not clear however in our paper we present data that explains in considerable detail how these mutations work
152923 british medicine is highly respected worldwide because of the training provided and the breadth of experience and clinical expertise of most consultants and gps

152925 given that bacterial vaginosis and hiv infection are both transmitted sexually it is difficult to determine whether associations found are causal or if there is some other reason why women with bv are more likely that others to become infected with hiv
152926 if additional follow up studies show that there was a relationship between bv and the risk of incident hiv infection though then increasing the treatment of bv could be considered for the future prevention of hiv infection
152927 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects
152928 genetic engineering in humans commonly known as gene doping when mentioned in connection with athletic performance is certainly feasible but very impractical
152929 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance
152930 that led us to consider whether ampk activation was the critical trigger that allowed ppar delta to work
152931 it essentially puts a turbo charge on ppar delta which explains why exercise is so important
152932 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise
152933 the transition from adolescence to adulthood has been shown to be a time for taking on many negative health behaviors including increases in smoking and alcohol use and decreases in physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption
152934 in this study we were investigating whether tv viewership and recognition of snack advertisements were associated with snack food consumption and the odds of being overweight or obese
152935 they blamed it on everything else under the sun they worked in loud factories they listened to loud music one got hit by a tractor
152936 some people with the mutation have hearing loss in their 40s of the kind we normally see in people a decade or more older
152937 often identifying a gene in individuals who have early onset of a disorder will help explain why the disorder occurs in the general population
152938 in many types of hereditary hearing loss its likely that environmental factors that people can control such as smoking and exposure to noise also can influence how severe the hearing loss is and how early in life it begins
152939 you can have children tested early so they dont have speech or school problems

152962 the ability to derive als motor neurons through a simple skin biopsy opens the doors to improved drug discovery for the first time researchers will be able to look at als cells under a microscope and see why they die if we can figure out how a persons motor neurons die we will figure out how to save motor neurons
152963 for the first time we have the opportunity to examine cellular and molecular defects in motor neurons and glial cells derived from patients with als and we can now begin drug screens on disease specific classes of human motor neurons
152964 through the work of the jenifer estess laboratory for stem cell research we now can glimpse the new age of als research an age of progress and promise

153065 un gobernador cuestionado con funcionarios con procesamientos l era secretario legal y t cnico y tiene que haber alg n grado de responsabilidad
153066 l no se fue estuvo hasta el ltimo d a y si hay reas cuestionadas de la gesti n c ccaro antes todo depend a de longhitano no es como ahora que descentralizaron y cada ministerio tiene sus abogados nadie nada me parece grave todo esto
153067 y esas letras estaban marcadas por el secretario legal y t cnico miguel longhitano entonces c mo es son truchadas pol ticas a m que me expliquen c mo puede ser que cuestionen el tema de las letras que est n orquestadas desde la secretar a legal y t cnica entonces que se saquen la careta y digan c mo son las cosas
153068 todo pasaba por la secretar a legal y t cnica por un visado por lo que fuese el tema de la polic a de los pagos en negro el tema del bolet n oficial tenemos muy mala memoria

153080 que no se convenci de que la mujer es la gobernadora no l hace un mes que estaba hablando del endeudamiento que hab a pedido de mil millones ahora est con el tema de aerol neas y se re ne con gorbacz para hacer una aerol nea federal por qu no se preocupa de los problemas de r o grande cuando en chacra xiii van a usar dos plantas potabilizadoras m viles y los efluentes van a ir al r o l es concejal es toda una contradicci n y est n buscando que se enfrenten ciudadanos con ciudadanos
153081 entonces las casas no se van a entregar en septiembre se van a dar el a o de la escarapela

153083 esto surge ante el vencimiento de la ley 746 de emergencia habitacional el 14 de agosto que permiti que mucha gente usurpara terrenos unos con necesidad y otros no a consecuencia de esto comenzaron a trabajar los bloque pol ticos par4a darle una propuesta diferencial a la ley 746 que en la pr ctica no sirvi para nada y lo reconoci mucha gente y que nos e avanz nada
153084 luego de un a o en que esta ley solo le sirvi al ari para ganar adhesiones esto no sirvi para otra cosa
153085 hoy veo con suma preocupaci n cuando desde los bloques mayoritarios se esta queriendo avanzar desde los bloques mayoritarios en un proyecto que entre su articulado va a tocar las coparticipaciones de los municipios de r o grande y ushuaia en un 20 de los que representa ingresos brutos que entran a las comunas
153086 llega a un monto de casi 24 millones de pesos al a o que son destinados para que la provincia pueda encarar servicios que no puede hacer con fondos propios veo con suma preocupaci n esto porque es una problem tica diferente a la de r o grande y la de ushuaia porque en r os grande el intendente est tratando de contener la demanda que hay en tierras permanentemente y lo anuncio en su discurso inaugural donde inform que su intenci n era comprar 400 terrenos por a o y se est gestionando a pesar de que no le devuelven la deuda que mantiene el gobierno con la provincia
153087 en este legislador hay mucha preocupaci n y ojala que la puedan ver los dem s legisladores de los bloque mayoritarios y oficialistas que est n detr s de esto y ojala que se den cuenta de que esto puede ser taparse la cabeza y destaparse los pies no vaya a ser que por buscar solucionar un problema se pare la acci n de los municipio en lo habitacional
153088 no vaya ser que por querer darle prioridad a mucha gente que no sigui los canales que se deben seguir para tener un terrenos las municipalidades dejen de darle servicios los dem s vecinos o la poblaci n
153089 esta iniciativa esta trabajada por los bloque y nosotros desde el bloque de la ucr no estamos de acuerdo en que toquen los fondos municipales sino que buscamos que se logre una ley que sea beneficiosa para todos ojala que se contenga a la mayor cantidad de sectores
153090 espero que no sea as pero indudablemente va creando precedentes negativos en contra de los municipios
153091 creo que hay muchos con la peque a y mezquindad pol tica que hoy no miran la crisis de la provincia y miran hacia el 2011 y el ejecutivo municipal y piensan que esta es una formad e socavar a los intendentes actuales y en realidad hay que dejar dela do estas cuestiones pol ticas mezquinas y pensar en el da o que se le puede hacer a la ciudad
153092 yo voy a defender a ultranza las autonom as municipales y voy a hacer todo lo posible para que no le metan la mano en el bolsillo a r o grande y ushuaia

153112 i know india is not happy at the fact that we are giving only half way support for this initiative
153113 but this is the case with most members of the iaea board
153114 at the end everyone will welcome india coming into the agencys arms as it were but most will be unhappy about the fact that it will now continue to remain outside the npt
153115 nonetheless we recognise the congress as a secular party as the biggest political party in the country its role has a relevance in determining the secular character of the state at this juncture it is this concern which led us to extend support to the congress led upa government

153193 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing

153210 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
153211 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
153212 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
153213 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
153214 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
153215 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
153216 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent

153219 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
153220 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
153221 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
153222 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
153223 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
153224 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot

153234 archaeology doesnt confirm or deny any of the bibles spiritual moral or religious claims its not an arbiter of faith it puts the events and stories of the new testament into a much richer and deeper context it cuts through 2 000 years of history and thousands of miles of geography and helps us to understand the words and deeds of jesus more as his contemporaries would have which is often quite different from what we take them to mean in 21st century america

153241 its a stretch to believe that the earth could be restored to life sustaining status because of the presence of a single live plant
153242 theyre down to one plant a seedling of some kind of vine
153243 theres no way a single individual plant could give rise to wheat grapes and re vegetate the earth not in human time anyway in evolutionary time of course thats what really happened
153244 the story line puts plants front and center it wasnt the roach they were looking for
153245 think what you see plants go through in vacant lots
153246 you made it somehow little guy you didnt give up
153247 a plant is not only front and center but its assumed that human beings passed the concept of a plant down through many generations

153262 the key mission for the united states looking forward is to maintain the cease fires and prevent people from going back to the warpath

153264 there is a reason to hope that its going to stay very low
153265 dealing with holdouts rather than trying to break the back of an ongoing insurgency
153266 now think of those unexploded bombs in surat recall their pictures didnt they look like diapers everyone here feels so
153267 if terrorists wanted to explode the bombs they would have done what they did in
153268 yaha sab shanti hai yeh public hai sab jaanti hai it is calm and peaceful here and the public knows everything
153269 in our opinion it was done by the opponents of gujarat chief minister narendra modi they want to make him unpopular so far modi has always been saying he has given security to the people of gujarat but these blasts have exposed him and everyone knows who benefits if modi is under attack
153270 we all know there are leaders in narendra modis party who want him out you see parliamentary elections will be held next year and if the bharatiya janata party wins in a big way in gujarat the credit will go to modi and he is the most popular leader in the bjp after l k advani his rivals dont want him to become very powerful post the 2009 elections
153271 that is why i asked you about huggies if any terrorist wanted to explode bombs he would have done it not done a shoddy job like this
153272 i dont think so local muslims know their city is the most peaceful city in gujarat why would they want to disturb the peace moreover what will they gain by such an act even if you consider they wanted to do it why will they place a bomb on a tree when i saw the images of those unexploded bombs i felt it looked like a cake
153273 the way these bombs were placed it is sure there is local involvement the terrorists have targeted the diamond market in particular out of 24 bombs 23 were kept in the citys diamond hub so there is definitely some big motive but i dont think muslims can be involved
153274 some people talk of revenge for the post godhra by muslims why will they target surat because there were no riots here since 1992
153275 the only possible involvement will be of muslims affected in the 1992 riots but i dont think they will take revenge after 16 years
153276 after the demolition of the babri masjid many muslims were killed in the riots and i feel muslims learnt from that incident that there is no point in fighting with each other as business suffers the most

153285 theres no doubt that false and damaging rumours were circulating about hbos on 19 march 2008 and these would have had some impact on hbos share price
153286 it is difficult however to say how much impact as the share price was also affected by the interaction of a number of other complex factors on the day
153287 we are examining what policies are in place and how firms ensure compliance with them whether and how rumours are verified whether traders are permitted to pass on or trade on rumours and how firms ensure staff do not or initiate or spread false rumours

153311 theres not a single word that means anything its not like these songs are deeply moving or inspirational or cultural in any way you could find useful
153312 i dont like pale imitations and shades of things and i am always wary when people go jazzy because jazz is the best cover up for a lack of talent the world has ever known it dont wash real with me
153313 and the cover up for her which is probably the guilt trip is that she requires vast amounts of drugs to hide the fact that she is fake
153314 women whose husbands work long hours are more likely to quit their jobs yet mens careers are not impacted when their wives put in long hours

153316 resurgence of the separate spheres arrangement the effect of spousal overwork on the employment of men and women in dual earner households
153317 the quality of the marking process is highly suspect and unfairly casts doubts on the professionalism and the integrity of school leaders their staff and the laudable efforts of the pupils in their care
153318 until schools are satisfied that all returned scripts have been submitted for full and thorough review with marks and levels accordingly adjusted naht members will continue to have absolutely no confidence or trust in the reliability of this years ks2 and ks3 test data
153319 ofqual will be closely monitoring the review process to ensure that it is carried through accurately and objectively so that pupils get the marks their work deserves
153320 there are some real question marks of the quality of marking
153321 my union would have preferred the holding back of the results until at least the national assessment agency did the job of looking at all the marks so there could be some real confidence in the system
153322 schools across the country have reported wildly erratic and inconsistent marking and there will be a significant number of appeals
153323 this horrifies me it is another example of how rich people exploit and pollute the planet because of their money

153364 we hope that foreign reporters while in china will respect our laws and rules report objectively and help communication and understanding between china and the peoples of the world
153365 the determining factor in securing the success of the olympic games is to work vigorously to promote the olympic spirit featuring friendship solidarity and peace
153366 the key is to ensure that athletes from all countries will have a level playing field to compete fairly
153367 we need to ensure that our friends from the five continents can further enhance their mutual understanding and deepen their friendship during the games
153368 only inevitable that people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues

153421 if youre running for president youre supposed to be an upstanding individual
153422 theyre thinking an obama who knows how to play the game is still better for me than a mccain
153423 there are a ton of people who clearly are looking for obama to denounce this in order to continue to view him as credible

153425 im not aware of hip hop music affecting any election so far and i dont think that this is going to be one either
153426 theres no doubt that hip hop culture moves our young people powerfully and some of it is not just a reflection of reality
153427 it also creates reality i think that if all our kids see is a glorification of materialism and bling and casual sex and kids are never seeing themselves reflected as hitting the books and being responsible and delaying gratification then they are getting an unrealistic picture of what the world is like
153428 lets get free strategies for organizing the hip hop voting bloc
153429 before a lot of the songs about barack were supporting his campaign
153430 this song is different in that it almost claims the victory thats scary for some people who dont want to see that happen

153441 this is not a complex case it should be one that moves quickly
153442 i am looking forward to this trial as a way of finally showing the truth that im innocent
153443 but ive never had a situation with a general election coming 98 days after an indictment
153444 the strategy is simple hes counting on the fact that the government doesnt have its ducks in a row
153445 you force their hand because its not a small thing to put together a trial of such magnitude in eight weeks
153446 president clinton and a veteran of politically charged investigations said stevens is doing his best to seize control of a bad situation mid campaign has boldly demonstrated he believes he is innocent
153447 the prosecutors will be under great pressure after all this to prove their case
153448 some defense cases improve with age this isnt likely to be one of them
153449 people of alaska have hired him to bring money back to this state

153460 im willing and ready to admit that im in pain every day its pretty terrible to be honest with you
153461 but i am here i am speaking with you im very fortunate and there are some that arent as fortunate as i and others that had no fortune that day
153462 its the type of thing we spend our careers trying to make sure does not occur
153463 that is not something you would want to leave to somebody else to have to pick up
153464 the bridge did collapse while i was the state bridge engineer so i feel i need to deal with it
153465 daily we spend time dealing with the aftermath of i 35w im not complaining
153466 im not going to tell you that weve never seen a political investigation here before
153467 but this one did have a good deal of political interest and outcry why this was a very highly visible event of incredible magnitude bridges dont fall in the united states its rare that they do very rare
153468 but we do not engage in politics we are not influenced by politics

153480 the market is selling off because of the weak economic numbers out of the u s
153481 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think will compensate for that
153482 prices will likely correct over the next six months to the 100 to 110 range
153483 there arent enough fundamental factors right now pushing prices higher
153484 theyve spent so much time together that one thing led to another and their relationship became physical

153487 shes enjoying every moment of their romance but shes not ready to get hitched again
153488 derek is very persistent and is used to getting his way
153489 adaptive reuse used to be a tactic of necessity people didnt have the time energy or money to build something new so they made the best with what they had today it is a way to stand out make a statement go bold and try something completely different from airplanes chapels and garages turned into houses to airplane hangers turned into tropical rain forest resorts the possibilities are essentially endless
153490 hes a champion hes a winner and we really couldnt be happier
153491 were willing to take the chance and go with this guy
153492 he said well ive got to tell you i dont know that youre going to see the guy from seattle
153493 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
153494 hopefully it pays dividends were confident weve got one of the best hitters in baseball coming in here one of the best hitters of his generation from the right side
153495 that was a 1 2 tandem that was one of the best in the game
153496 one of the things that factored into this was a guy who has had a great career but has not won a championship and how motivated hes going to be to get on that stage
153497 i just think theres a lot of added things he can bring
153498 i mean i had posters of that guy on my wall growing up so i think its going to be an awesome thing for all of us
153499 gives him a lot of hope that these startups are really pulling together and are building these communities that are going to bring forth these great next companies
153500 its the last chance to see heath and hes brilliant

153515 i know no one is supposed to look into friendlies too much but im worried that our star strike force isnt really working ive seen both in 3 games now and i havent yet been impressed the players that have impressed me most were mitchell tomlin and deano mcdonald could it be that we spent a lot of money for nothing or am i jumping the gun too quickly
153516 arsenal gave us a lesson in passing yesterday which we could not match however playing such high calibre opposition resulting in us having to raise our game should enable us to start the new season well ive been very impressed by most of the players in the last 2 friendlies the injury to clare is a blow although mcdonald should prove to be a good partner for phillips up front

153555 but instead i usually end up talking about something mundane like the weather
153556 if a merchant have 50 000 l all his own to gain 10 per cent on it he must make 5 000 l a year and must charge for his goods accordingly but if another has only 10 000 l and borrows 40 000 l by discounts no extreme instance in our modem trade he has the same capital of 50 000 l to use and can sell much cheaper if the rate at which he borrows be 5 per cent he will have to pay 2 000 l a year and if like the old trader he make 5 000 l a year he will still after paying his interest obtain 3 000 l a year or 30 per cent on his own 10 000 l as most merchants are content with much less than 30 per cent he will be able if he wishes to forego some of that profit lower the price of the commodity and drive the old fashioned trader the man who trades on his own capital out of the market
153557 great firms with a reputation which they have received from the past and which they wish to transmit to the future cannot be guilty of small frauds they live by a continuity of trade which detected fraud would spoil when we scrutinise the reason of the impaired reputation of english goods we find it is the fault of new men with little money of their own created by bank discounts these men want business at once and they produce an inferior article to get it they rely on cheapness and rely successfully
153558 some of those deposits too are of a peculiar and very distinct nature since the franco german war we have become to a much larger extent than before the bankers of europe a very large sum of foreign money is on various accounts and for various purposes held here and in a time of panic it might be asked for in 1866 we held only a much smaller sum of foreign money but that smaller sum was demanded and we had to pay it at great cost and suffering and it would be far worse if we had to pay the greater sums we now hold without better resources than we had then it may be replied that though our instant liabilities are great our present means are large that though we have much we may be asked to pay at any moment we have very much always ready to pay it with but on the contrary there is no country at present and there never was any country before in which the ratio of the cash reserve to the bank deposits was so small as it is now in england so far from our being able to rely on the proportional magnitude of our cash in hand the amount of that cash is so exceedingly small that a bystander almost trembles when he compares its minuteness with the immensity of the credit which rests upon it again it may be said that we need not be alarmed at the magnitude of our credit system or at its refinement for that we have learned by experience the way of controlling it and always manage it with discretion but we do not always manage it with discretion there is the astounding instance of overend gurney and co to the contrary ten years ago that house stood next to the bank of england in the city of london it was better known abroad than any similar firm known perhaps better than any purely english firm the partners had great estates which had mostly been made in the business they still derived an immense income from it yet in six years they lost all their own wealth sold the business to the company and then lost a large part of the companys capital and these losses were made in a manner so reckless and so foolish that one would think a child who had lent money in the city of london would have lent it better after this example we must not confide too surely in long established credit or in firmly rooted traditions of business we must examine the system on which these great masses of money are manipulated and assure ourselves that it is safe and right
153559 all which a banker wants to pay his creditors is a sufficient supply of the legal tender of the country no matter what that legal tender may be
153560 by the law of england the legal tenders are gold and silver coin the last for small amounts only and bank of england notes but the number of our attainable bank notes is not like american greenbacks dependent on the will of the state it is limited by the provisions of the act of 1844 that act separates the bank of england into two halves the issue department only issues notes and can only issue 15 000 000 l on government securities for all the rest it must have bullion deposited take for example an account which may be considered an average specimen of those of the last few years that for the last week of 1869 there are here 15 000 000 l bank notes issued on securities and 18 288 640 l represented by bullion the bank of england has no power by law to increase the currency in any other manner it holds the stipulated amount of securities and for all the rest it must have bullion this is the cast iron system the hard and fast line which the opponents of the act say ruins us and which the partizans of the act say saves us but i have nothing to do with its expediency here all which is to my purpose is that our paper legal tender our bank notes can only be obtained in this manner if therefore an english banker retains a sum of bank of england notes or coin in due proportion to his liabilities he has a sufficient amount of the legal tender of this country and he need not think of anything more
153561 legal tenders are gold and silver coin the last for small amounts only and bank of england notes
153562 the bill brokers lend most of their money and deposit the remnant either with the bank of england or some london banker
153563 formerly there were two such stores in europe one was the bank of france and the other the bank of england but since the suspension of specie payments by the bank of france its use as a reservoir of specie is at an end no one can draw a cheque on it and be sure of getting gold or silver for that cheque accordingly the whole liability for such international payments in cash is thrown on the bank of england no doubt foreigners cannot take from us our own money they must send here value in some shape or other for all they take away but they need not send cash they may send good bills and discount them in lombard street and take away any part of the produce or all the produce in bullion it is only putting the same point in other words to say that all exchange operations are centering more and more in london formerly for many purposes paris was a european settling house but now it has ceased to be so the note of the bank of france has not indeed been depreciated enough to disorder ordinary transactions but any depreciation however small even the liability to depreciation without its reality is enough to disorder exchange transactions they are calculated to such an extremity of fineness that the change of a decimal may be fatal and may turn a profit into a loss accordingly london has become the sole great settling house of exchange transactions in europe instead of being formerly one of two and this pre eminence london will probably maintain for it is a natural pre eminence the number of mercantile bills drawn upon london incalculably surpasses those drawn on any other european city london is the place which receives more than any other place and pays more than any other place and therefore it is the natural clearing house the pre eminence of paris partly arose from a distribution of political power which is already disturbed but that of london depends on the regular course of commerce which is singularly stable and hard to change
153564 in most banks there would be a wholesome dread restraining the desire of the shareholders to reduce the reserve they would fear to impair the credit of the bank but fortunately or unfortunately no one has any fear about the bank of england
153565 no country has ever been so exposed as england to a foreign demand on its banking reserve not only because at present england is a large borrower from foreign nations but also and much more because no nation has ever had a foreign trade of such magnitude in such varied objects or so ramified through the world the ordinary foreign trade of a country requires no cash the exports on one side balance the imports on the other but a sudden trade of import like the import of foreign corn after a bad harvestor what is much less common though there are cases of it the cessation of any great export causes a balance to become due which must be paid in cash now the only source from which large sums of cash can be withdrawn in countries where banking is at all developed is a bank reserve in england especially except a few sums of no very considerable amount held by bullion dealers in the course of their business there are no sums worth mentioning in cash out of the banks an ordinary person could hardly pay a serious sum without going to some bank even if he spent a month in trying all persons who wish to pay a large sum in cash trench of necessity on the banking reserve but then what is cash within a country the action of a government can settle the quantity and therefore the value of its currency but outside its own country no government can do so bullion is the cash of international trade paper currencies are of no use there and coins pass only as they contain more or less bullion
153566 a panic in a word is a species of neuralgia and according to the rules of science you must not starve it the holders of the cash reserve must be ready not only to keep it for their own liabilities but to advance it most freely for the liabilities of others they must lend to merchants to minor bankers to this man and that man whenever the security is good in wild periods of alarm one failure makes many and the best way to prevent the derivative failures is to arrest the primary failure which causes them the way in which the panic of 1825 was stopped by advancing money has been described in so broad and graphic a way that the passage has become classical we lent it said mr harman on behalf of the bank of england by every possible means and in modes we had never adopted before we took in stock on security we purchased exchequer bills we made advances on exchequer bills we not only discounted outright but we made advances on the deposit of bills of exchange to an immense amount in short by every possible means consistent with the safety of the bank and we were not on some occasions over nice seeing the dreadful state in which the public were we rendered every assistance in our power after a day or two of this treatment the entire panic subsided and the city was quite calm the problem of managing a panic must not be thought of as mainly a banking problem it is primarily a mercantile one all merchants are under liabilities they have bills to meet soon and they can only pay those bills by discounting bills on other merchants in other words all merchants are dependent on borrowing money and large merchants are dependent on borrowing much money at the slightest symptom of panic many merchants want to borrow more than usual they think they will supply themselves with the means of meeting their bills while those means are still forthcoming if the bankers gratify the merchants they must lend largely just when they like it least if they do not gratify them there is a panic
153567 no doubt all precautions may in the end be unavailing on extraordinary occasions says ricardo a general panic may seize the country when every one becomes desirous of possessing himself of the precious metals as the most convenient mode of realising or concealing his property against such panic banks have no security or any system the bank or banks which hold the reserve may last a little longer than the others but if apprehension pass a certain bound they must perish too the use of credit is that it enables debtors to use a certain part of the money their creditors have lent them if all those creditors demand all that money at once they cannot have it for that which their debtors have used is for the time employed and not to be obtained with the advantages of credit we must take the disadvantages too but to lessen them as much as we can we must keep a great store of ready money always available and advance out of it very freely in periods of panic and in times of incipient alarm
153568 and great as is the delicacy of such a problem in all countries it is far greater in england now than it was or is elsewhere the strain thrown by a panic on the final bank reserve is proportional to the magnitude of a countrys commerce and to the number and size of the dependent banks banks that is holding no cash reserve that are grouped around the central bank or banks and in both respects our system causes a stupendous strain the magnitude of our commerce and the number and magnitude of the banks which depend on the bank of england are undeniable there are very many more persons under great liabilities than there are or ever were anywhere else at the commencement of every panic all persons under such liabilities try to supply themselves with the means of meeting those liabilities while they can this causes a great demand for new loans and so far from being able to meet it the bankers who do not keep an extra reserve at that time borrow largely or do not renew large loans very likely do both
153569 the mode in which the bank of england meets this great responsibility is very curious it unquestionably does make
153570 i shall have failed in my purpose if i have not proved that the system of entrusting all our reserve to a single board like that of the bank directors is very anomalous that it is very dangerous that its bad consequences though much felt have not been fully seen that they have been obscured by traditional arguments and hidden in the dust of ancient controversies

153612 anybody who wants to sign up would get an incredible opportunity in literally 6 minutes and all with just 1 click you can get 5 powerful websites that are already making money
153613 its a win win situation for anybody whos been looking to get in on the lucrative field of making money online
153614 certainly internally theres no doubt i would tell people who dont like the art style that probably getting the art style was the hardest thing
153615 diablo is a game you play for hopefully hundreds of hours and one of the rewards is a variety of different looking environments
153616 people remember the act i dungeons but they kind of conveniently forget the green fields of act i and all of act ii and its palaces its bright deserts
153617 theres a philosophy that goes across all of our games and that philosophy stays true from game to game so it probably draws some comparisons
153618 one philosophy is that our artists feel like if theyre just using photorealism not creating a unique look for the game not stylizing so that its uniquely blizzard then theyre not doing their jobs
153619 diablo can do a lot of things wow cant even do
153620 we cant do the level of violence that they can do in diablo iii we would lose our rating if we do the things that diablo iii does they have a much darker vibe
153621 if were actually making the game worse with no other reason than to be different from wow then its a bad choice we dont think when people play that theyll have any problem telling that its a different game
153622 we want to generate the feeling of everything getting worse its part of our narrative it makes the more gloomy part of the game a place where the stakes get higher
153623 im a huge fan of achievement systems in other games i love xboxs system and i also think steam did a really good job in introducing achievements we always talked about it for wow since players are always measuring themselves against other players
153624 the greatest example is the xbox gamerscore which is for absolutely nothing
153625 i think by the time we ship well have close to 700 achievements we have 500 in the beta right now and that number grows by 10 to 20 a day at this point were really getting a lot of content in there kind of crossing all the different aspects of the game
153626 that is our goal and sometimes it gets taken in a weird direction
153627 like youre failing if youre not releasing an expansion each year its probably going to be a long time before we get to the point where we are releasing an expansion each year
153628 our goal is to make an awesome experience and obviously we felt that lich king needed more time to get to where it needed to go
153629 i dont want to undervalue innovation but theres sometimes the wrong focus on innovation i think you innovate when you need to and i also think the best innovations are things that people overlook and dont even recognize as being innovative
153630 execute on all systems well whether theyre innovative or not
153631 wows rest system was the first of its kind and people dont stop and think about its effects on people psychologically that there is actually a bonus for coming back to the game but playing for a long time is not a great thing
153632 its a subtle system and displayed well so although when people talk about wow its the last system on anyones mind every single mmo thats come out since wow they have all added that exact same system
153633 i completely believe that a game could come out and be more successful than wow im hoping that were working on it right now
153634 i think a lot of other companies have had great opportunities to do what wow has done usually for whatever reason they miss the mark
153635 i actually feel really bad a lot of times when new mmos come out and dont do really well because im not thinking of it from a business perspective i know what its like to be a developer on a team that you believe in on a game that you just love and for some reason you dont get enough time or someone makes a bad decision everybodys making a lot of small choices and when those go wrong your game ends up not successful
153636 not making choices based upon being different but making choices based upon whats good for your game
153637 the same challenge is on us are we going to make the right decisions i dont believe that just because we made wow were guaranteed on the next mmo that we make to have the same success
153638 i really believe youre only as good as your last game i really think you gave to prove it every time

153642 many people have left the shelters but those remaining are still there because they are too scared to return that is unlikely to change in two weeks
153643 pretending that refugees are now safe to return will not make the refugees safe
153644 the province should start planning what steps it will make to accommodate the people who are still too scared to return when the shelters close in two weeks time
153645 its really a recipe for disaster unless they get more funding
153646 this is becoming a health issue for low income people who have fixed incomes
153647 its going to be a job to explain it to constituents there is no doubt about that
153648 were getting some calls from clients stating what are we going to do
153649 said matt hall executive director of interfaith mission in state college his agency runs the countys fuel bank which last year helped 300 households with the assistance of other local charities the agencies spent about 80 000
153650 we talk about how were all suffering equally its not true for poor families this is very scary
153651 weve got to look at the issue of energy costs
153652 if we dont get that under control were going to be putting more money into liheap every year
153653 a vacation is having nothing to do and all day to do it

153657 as soon as the pair get some free time they will be jetting out to their new pad to make up for lost time
153658 the extension of the conservatorship was at the request and suggestion of britneys doctors theyve indicated shes made great improvement but its a work in progress jamie spears doesnt want the conservatorship to last a day longer than the doctors recommend
153659 rest assured she wont make any rash decisions regards their marriage balthazar is incredibly confused at the moment torn in fact
153660 as time goes by he realizes how deep his love for rosetta and the children is rosetta thinks the bond she has with him and their kids is stronger than anything sienna can offer
153661 despite reports to the contrary the door is still open for a reconciliation
153662 rosetta is maintaining a dignified silence with regards to this whole affair she has their children to think about

153667 they said they didnt need permission its extremely arrogant im concerned about the intrusion into peoples private lives its a civil liberties issue they should be engaging the public rather than spying on them
153668 the operatives involved in the sorting were waste professionals acting under a strict code of conduct which included the possibility of finding items of a personal nature such as confidential paperwork
153669 this was an investigation into the types of rubbish being collected generally to see what type of material is being sent to landfill and how much more of it could be recycled
153670 again rubbish is not looked at individually or records taken or kept of what relates to an individual address confidentiality is taken very seriously
153671 as locals showed me where many of the pots were i noticed that they tended to line up
153672 i plotted them on a map and realized they aligned with the san andreas
153673 documenting their history when they appeared how long they last may be a useful test of this hypothesis that they are an extension of the fault
153674 knowing history may also provide insight into the plumbing of the fault and the origin of the fluids and high pressure needed to make mud volcanoes
153675 mens hair should not cover their eyebrows ears or touch their collar
153676 women should comb their hair appropriately for age occupation and situation
153677 young girls can wear skirts three centimetres to six centimetres above the knee but never too short for middle aged and older women the skirt should be at least three centimetres below the knee
153678 clothes should not be too small otherwise this makes people feel you are unreliable
153679 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
153680 i think we need a senator in new hampshire whos going to represent families in new hampshire not oil companies
153681 explain that only democrats stand in the way of relief at the pump
153682 it seems to me that politically it would be a winner for conservatives to fight on drilling up to and including a government shutdown
153683 would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
153684 steve forbes has pointed out that while the pastries he buys each morning at
153685 so not only are consumer prices a bad measure of inflation those same prices frequently hide real price increases that government measures of inflation cant register
153686 the only true measure of inflation does not involve prices but instead involves the value of the dollar itself the most reliable benchmark is not the greenbacks value versus the euro yen or pound but the dollars value in terms of gold
153687 notably gold has risen 283 against the dollar since june of 2001 whereas a dollar used to buy 1tk253 of an ounce of gold as of this writing it buys 1tk970 of an ounce for those wondering why all manner of commodities from gasoline to corn to meat have become so expensive over the last few years look no further than the dollars debasement just as golds rise was a major inflationary event in the 1970s so is it today cpi and other government measures of inflation that show light pricing pressures are charitably wrong
153688 the activists were on their way to participate in the celebrations and the security forces stopped them they did not take into account the decision of the interior ministry
153689 we cant drill our way out of high gas prices
153690 i cant believe id ever think 3 70 gas was cheap
153691 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
153692 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
153693 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
153694 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
153695 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
153696 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
153697 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
153698 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
153699 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
153700 so far all weve been hearing about is paris hilton
153701 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
153702 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
153703 the hard part of getting water to split is not the hydrogen platinum as a catalyst works fine for the hydrogen but platinum works very poorly for oxygen making you use much more energy
153704 what we have done is made a catalyst work for the oxygen part without any extra energy in fact with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
153705 nickel oxide cant be used around anything else in the environment because of corrosion even the carbon dioxide in the air will react with it to make carbonates
153706 but our catalyst uses abundant materials that dont react with environment
153707 because our catalyst is green the machines that perform electrolysis can be much less expensive than they are today since they dont need to be protected from environmental contaminants
153708 solar cell makers can add super cheap electrolyzers to their system so that they work 24 7 during the day making hydrogen and oxygen then at night recombining it in fuel cells to generate electricity
153709 i cannot deliver the state but i have already been trying to be helpful to senator obama and i will continue to do that
153710 i cant even deliver ohio for myself it takes a lot of people to help a candidate win a state ill try to do my part certainly
153711 ive said and i deeply believe that ohio race will be very close very competitive thats the nature of ohio
153712 given recent recent events will a commission be all thats needed to reform the cuyahoga county government franklin co democratic chair backs columbus councilman boyce for treasurer getting children engaged in the stem disciplines is important the tools are here to get them involved hands on this center is obviously valued by those who bring their children here

153714 il nuovo piano di air france per alitalia arrivato il progetto consegnato questa notte ai sindacati conferma i 2 120 esuberi 1 620 per alitalia fly e 500 per alitalia servizi i tagli riguardano 507 piloti 594 assistenti di volo 121 dipendenti allestero e 398 del personale di terra in italia
153715 io dico che se esistono in italia degli imprenditori con un minimo di orgoglio si devono fare avanti con unofferta ed un progetto industriale per evitare una fine cos ingloriosa della nostra compagnia di bandiera
153716 indeed i did have a relationship with miss lewinsky that was not appropriate
153717 in fact it was wrong it constituted a critical lapse in judgment and a personal failure on my part for which i am solely and completely responsible
153718 first of all we have assumed that a majority of americans basically agrees with our point of view that has been the premise upon which we have tried to build any number of institutions and indeed our whole strategy the second premise has been that if we could just elect enough conservatives we could get our people in as congressional leaders and they would fight to implement our agenda
153719 did not result in the adoption of our agenda the reason i think is that politics itself has failed and politics has failed because of the collapse of the culture the culture we are living in becomes an ever wider sewer in truth i think we are caught up in a cultural collapse of historic proportions a collapse so great that it simply overwhelms politics
153720 it is impossible to ignore the fact that the united states is becoming an ideological state the ideology of political correctness which openly calls for the destruction of our traditional culture has so gripped the body politic has so gripped our institutions that it is even affecting the church it has completely taken over the academic community it is now pervasive in the entertainment industry and it threatens to control literally every aspect of our lives let me be perfectly frank about it if there really were a moral majority out there bill clinton would have been driven out of office months ago it is not only the lack of political will on the part of republicans although that is part of the problem more powerful is the fact that what americans would have found absolutely intolerable only a few years ago a majority now not only tolerates but celebrates americans have adopted in large measure the mtv culture that we so valiantly opposed just a few years ago and it has permeated the thinking of all but those who have separated themselves from the contemporary culture i believe that we probably have lost the culture war that doesnt mean the war is not going to continue and that it isnt going to be fought on other fronts but in terms of society in general we have lost this is why even when we win in politics our victories fail to translate into the kind of policies we believe are important

153806 youre sitting there enjoying your trip and then all of a sudden somebody gets stabbed i imagine it would be pretty traumatic the way they acted was extraordinary
153807 were very brave they reacted swiftly calmly in exiting the bus and as a result nobody else was injured
153808 he must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times
153809 i never took the time to know him but he seemed to be ok right just a kid
153810 like just everywhere arms legs neck chest guts wherever he could swing it he got it

153815 the highly competitive high risk nature of construction is causing contractors to make useful and accurate analysis and reporting a top priority

153832 one of the things we have accomplished is pushing governmental entities to be more transparent
153833 im not sure there would have even been a pandemicflu gov if it hadnt been for our site

153838 i have a wall of textbooks but sometimes you need more current information a textbook costs us 300 and by the time it comes out its out of date
153839 medicine has lagged behind other professions in its use of technology

153904 there was a bloodcurdling scream i was just reading my book and all of a sudden i heard it
153905 it was like something between a dog howling and a baby crying i guess you could say
153906 i dont think it will leave me for a while
153907 what you saw and what you experienced would shake the most seasoned police officer and yet im told that each of you acted swiftly calmly and bravely
153908 everybody got off the bus me and a trucker that stopped and the greyhound driver ran up to the door to maybe see if the guy was still alive or we could help or something like that
153909 and when we all got up we saw that the guy was cutting off the guys head when he saw us he came back to the front of the bus told the driver to shut the door he pressed the button and the door shut but it didnt shut in time and the guy was able to get his knife out and take a swipe at us
153910 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
153911 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal
153912 there was no rage or anything he was like a robot stabbing the guy
153913 we will do whatever is required to help them and that includes counseling
153914 there are preincident indicators things that happen before violence occurs

153921 and what i really want to teach today and forever is the feeling is the warning sign all the other stuff is our explanation for the feeling why it was this why it was that the feeling itself is the warning sign

153926 we did a good job of due diligence in seeking about for the best qualified non conflicted firms we narrowed it down to three
153927 on the day of presentations the first two did fine competent jobs of presenting to us forge the third to present began with a similarly competent 10 minutes of opening then they switched gears
153928 unbeknownst to us they had spent time going around to several of our branches with a video camera looking at and talking to employees customers and citizens assessing the kinds of interactions they saw and they brought the results to the presentation with us
153929 heres a taste of how we see the bank they said by way of introduction this is our view of what you stand for and the message you want to convey
153930 about ten minutes into the video our ceo jumped up and said yes thats it these people have got it right
153931 so we decided on forge they went about their work and when they came back to present us with their work i remembered that first meeting they pretty much opened right up with their new tagline you matter more
153932 i remember thinking wait thats it all these months and all we get is three words but i remembered that first meeting and said to myself hold on these people totally got who we were settle down and trust that theyve got something behind that slogan
153933 well it became clear that they had a lot behind that slogan we loved their ideas and the slogan indeed fit the message perfectly

153958 for nearly two years a young political aide sought to cultivate a farm system for republicans at the justice department hiring scores of prosecutors and immigration judges who espoused conservative priorities and christian lifestyle choices
153959 that aide monica m goodling exercised what amounted to veto power over a wide range of critical jobs asking candidates for their views on abortion and same sex marriage and maneuvering around senior officials who outranked her including the departments second in command the report concluded yesterday that goodling and others had broken civil service laws run afoul of department policy and engaged in misconduct a finding that could expose them to further scrutiny and sanctions
153960 nor is it the work of a few bad individuals it is the consequence of triumph by a particular philosophy of government by a movement that understands the liberal state as a perversion and considers the market the ideal nexus of human society
153961 this movement is friendly to industry not just by force of campaign contributions but by conviction it believes in entrepreneurship not merely in commerce but in politics and the inevitable results of its ascendance are first the capture of the state by business and second what follows from that incompetence graft and all the other wretched flotsam that weve come to expect from washington
153962 the conservatism that speaks to us through its actions in washington is institutionally opposed to those baseline good intentions we learned about in elementary school
153963 they have made a cult of outsourcing and privatizing they have wrecked established federal operations because they disagree with them and they have deliberately piled up an everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis
153964 we are a free and sovereign people we govern ourselves and the government is ours
153965 we cheat our government and we let our leaders loot it and we let them wheedle and bribe our sovereignty from us
153966 these results indicate that stevia rebaudiana may be useful as a potential source
153967 it seems to me that the nature of the ultimate revolution with which we are now faced is precisely this that we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy who have always existed and presumably will always exist to get people to love their servitude

153973 i think people when they get successful take time to enjoy it they take time off go on vacation go do other things not that it means artistic mold but the audience moves so much faster these days in the past yeah you could take time off and come back a year or six months later but ive never taken any time off since i started with the runaways ive always been touring always doing it it keeps me feeling interested feeling out there feeling connected
153974 all the ones that youve heard its a mans world thats completely true in the runaways we took verbal abuse from people for what we did the boys are telling us girls cant rock the girls are telling us you can rock but you cant have any sexuality in it all those conflicting ideas all those people telling us what to do

154179 in our view the best way is to try to help the poor by direct income support targeted safety nets like food for work programs and to avoid general subsidies which waste resources and dont help the poor

154181 the failure of the wto world trade organization talks is not good news
154182 it was reasonably stable in the north northwest and in central afghanistan drought for example has especially struck in the north in badghis farah konduz and we see an increase in insecurity which of course very much limits our access

154247 i was investigating installing solar water heating for my family home and realised that there was no comprehensive point of reference where i could find the information and contacts i needed with so much focus on global warming it was obvious that there was a huge gap in the market for this kind of website we are very excited about how the website will serve both people and businesses and help to accelerate the use of renewable technology within the uk
154248 national trends show that renewable energy isnt a choice for businesses to buy into any more but a necessity in order to maintain the sustainability of the planet this website provides a huge range of resources and has one of the only fully comprehensive directories of companies relating to renewable energy in the uk

154293 there was some early uproar when facebook first permitted applications about some of the music sharing apps
154294 what ultimately happened then was that the music sharing apps very rapidly were tweaked so that people werent doing any actual file sharing
154295 hasbro certainly couldve saber rattled and pushed the issue with facebook
154296 particularly under the grokster decision from a few years back facebook has to be very careful even if its getting indemnity from the people who are putting applications on the site that indemnity might not amount to much if theres very little there to back it up
154297 in fact in last weeks f8 conference announcement they said they are trying to award and sort out the good applications versus the not so good ones
154298 its posturing but its the way that they are ensuring that theyre not in bed with their application makers for this purpose

154300 i think that this is a questionable area of intellectual property law and its not clear cut
154301 when things arent clear cut you dont necessarily go and cut off peoples access to platforms
154302 the thing is theres 400 000 developers using facebooks platform and theyre trying to find ways to be successful and that means copying games that are going to work
154303 theyre clearly trying to segment quality apps that help the user experience versus ones that dont

154305 the concept of responsible disclosure is well and good for new locks that havent hit the market yet but that doesnt help you when the lock is already embedded in millions of facilities theyre not going to fix them

154309 as new technologies have become available that is what spurred product innovation and that spurs development of new standards
154310 our responsibility is to make changes when we see a change in the state of the art
154311 everybody has some responsibility to not disclose things that can hurt people and that people dont have power over changing
154312 is it a known vulnerability if people dont know about it
154313 im not sure you need to worry about it unless people are out there demonstrating it and showing how to do it
154314 the assumption is that the criminals dont know about it
154315 criminals know how to pick locks the secrecy just hides the truth from the consumer
154316 the goal is to make security better as soon as its not responsible to do research the bad guys win
154317 the lock picking industry doesnt get this because theyre basically still a guild a secret knowledge kind of field whereas computer security is always built on open knowledge
154318 there have been insecurities discovered by computer people turned locksmiths that have existed for hundreds of years

154328 it may increase the likelihood that people will become transsexual
154329 the present study found that a mutant gene that ultimately results in higher testosterone levels is overrepresented in female to male transsexualism this is in line with what we previously know about masculinisation of the brain and is therefore less likely to be a chance finding hence the study is important and adds to the notion that gender identity is influenced by sex hormones early in life and that certain gene combinations make individuals more vulnerable to aberrant effects

154392 anglican ecclesiology embodies as a principle that the 38 provinces live in relationship to each other therefore they must speak with a clear voice to each other the covenant will make explicit what should be implicit in our life together such as who has the right to say what to whom
154393 it is hoped that the anglican communion will not decline into legalism calling each other to account thru disciplinary procedures instead of relational factors looses the balance of communion we must not bind the life of the anglican communion into a straight jacket

154398 we now need to take account of the decision of a significant number of anglican bishops not to attend this lambeth conference
154399 in such a scenario who will our dialogue partner be should we and how can we appropriately and honestly engage in conversations also with those who share catholic perspectives on the points currently in dispute and who disagree with some developments within the anglican communion or particular anglican provinces
154400 were it not for romes strong insistence upon christ as the only saviour of the world upon the catholic faith the nature of the triune god the divinity of christ the importance of sacred scripture and of the objectivity of christian morality then the life of other christian churches would have been so much more difficult certainly for us here in the west
154401 among those in which catholic traditions and institutions in part continue to exist the anglican communion occupies a special place
154402 as the roman catholic church and the constituent churches of the anglican communion have sought to grow in mutual understanding and christian love they have come to recognize to value and to give thanks for a common faith in god our father in our lord jesus christ and in the holy spirit our common baptism into christ our sharing of the holy scriptures of the apostles and nicene creeds the chalcedonian definition and the teaching of the fathers our common christian inheritance for many centuries with its living traditions of liturgy theology spirituality and mission
154403 to the achievement of points of convergence and even of agreement which many would not have thought possible before the commission began its work
154404 as our dialogue has developed many catholics and anglicans have found in each other a love for christ which invites us into practical co operation and service this fellowship in the service of christ experienced by many of our communities around the world adds a further impetus to our relationship
154405 the questions and problems of our friends are also our questions and problems
154406 since this mississauga meeting however the churches of the anglican communion have entered into a period of dispute occasioned by the episcopal ordination of a person living in an openly acknowledged committed same sex relationship and the authorisation of public rites of blessing for same sex unions these matters have intensified reflection on the nature of the relationship between the churches of the communion in addition ecumenical relationships have become more complicated as proposals within the church of england have focussed attention on the issue of the ordination of women to the episcopate which is an established part of ministry in some anglican provinces
154407 quam unitatem tenere firmiter et vindicare debemus maxime episcopi qui in ecclesia praesidimus ut episcopatum quoque ipsum unum atque indivisum probemus
154408 episcopatus unus est cuius a singulis in solidum pars tenetur
154409 united and held together by the glue of the mutual cohesion of the bishops
154410 for the nurture and growth of this communion christ the lord has provided a ministry of oversight the fullness of which is entrusted to the episcopate which has the responsibility of maintaining and expressing the unity of the churches cf 33 amp 39 final report ministry and ordination by shepherding teaching and the celebration of the sacraments especially the eucharist this ministry holds believers together in the communion of the local church and in the wider communion of all the churches cf 39 this ministry of oversight has both collegial and primatial dimensions it is grounded in the life of the community and is open to the communitys participation in the discovery of gods will it is exercised so that unity and communion are expressed preserved and fostered at every level locally regionally and universally
154411 intended to assure each community that its faith is indeed the apostolic faith received and transmitted from apostolic times
154412 there are two dimensions to communion in the apostolic tradition diachronic and synchronic the process of tradition clearly entails the transmission of the gospel from one generation to another diachronic if the church is to remain united in the truth it must also entail the communion of the churches in all places in that one gospel synchronic both are necessary for the catholicity of the church 26
154413 both a voice for the local church and one through whom the local church learns from other churches
154414 the mutual interdependence of all the churches is integral to the reality of the church as god wills it to be no local church that participates in the living tradition can regard itself as self sufficient the ministry of the bishop is crucial for his ministry serves communion within and among local churches their communion with each other is expressed through the incorporation of each bishop into a college of bishops bishops are both personally and collegially at the service of the communion
154415 n otwithstanding the substantial ecclesiological issues still dividing us which will continue to need our attention this approach is fundamentally in line with the communion ecclesiology of the second vatican council the consequences which the report draws from this ecclesiological base are also constructive especially the interpretation of provincial autonomy in terms of interdependence thus subject to limits generated by the commitments of communion windsor n 79 related to this is the reports thrust towards strengthening the supra provincial authority of the archbishop of canterbury nn 109 110 and the proposal of an anglican covenant which would make explicit and forceful the loyalty and bonds of affection which govern the relationships between the churches of the communion n 118
154416 w hile the report stresses that anglican provinces have a responsibility towards each other and towards the maintenance of communion a communion rooted in the scriptures considerably little attention is given to the importance of being in communion with the faith of the church through the ages
154417 has important ecumenical ramifications since we share a common tradition of one and a half millennia this common patrimony what pope paul vi and archbishop michael ramsey called our ancient common traditions is worth being appealed to and preserved
154418 it is our overwhelming desire that the anglican communion stays together rooted in the historic faith which our dialogue and relations over four decades have led us to believe that we share to a large degree
154419 in the discussions on human sexuality within the anglican communion and between it and the catholic church stand anthropological and biblical hermeneutical questions which need to be addressed
154420 priestly ordination in the catholic church from the beginning has always been reserved to men alone
154421 this tradition has also been faithfully maintained by the oriental churches
154422 i declare that the church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the churchs faithful
154423 lead to that unity in truth for which christ prayed
154424 a restoration of complete communion of faith and sacramental life
154425 belonging to the church of christ are forces impelling to ward catholic unity

154434 the consequences of the us india deal for the nsg could be even more adverse
154435 prime minister manmohan singh has been very forthright in stating that the nuclear deal would in no way constrain new delhis right to resume testing india is not a party to the npt and it is one of the only 14 states that have not signed the ctbt if india decides to test again so be it but the bulwarks of the global non proliferation system should not become complicit in this decision if so the negative consequences of another game changing decision by the bush administration will be greatly compounded the damage arising from this deal can be limited by making it harder for a future indian government to resume nuclear testing
154436 the bush administration has obliged india by relaxing commercial constraints without asking for meaningful steps to strengthen global non proliferation norms especially indias signature on the 1996 comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt

154478 there are numerous threats to security in iraq and the future of iraq do you still view al qaeda in iraq as a major threat
154479 it is a major threat though it is certainly as not as major a threat as it was say 15 months ago
154480 we continue to be concerned about iranian taking al qaeda into iran training them and sending them back mr

154509 during a half hour tour of the market obama sampled wares at claudio specialty food and dibruno brothers where he noshed on a spanish ham that retails for 99 99 a pound
154510 staff at dibrunos told him the ham only recently became available because it was previously barred by the fda all i know is it tastes good obama said as good as whiz with onions

154512 was it that guys goal to tick obama off and get him looking bad on camera id say obama kept his cool and handled it well but im sure there will be people who will say this is obama losing his cool to that id say if this is obama losing his cool obama is very cool perhaps a better question is whether obama is too cool too bland and unemotional to enthuse us

154607 las familias de campo sufren cada d a m s intentos de desalojos detenciones y criminalizaci n con o sin retenciones la represi n seguir las fumigaciones que nos envenenan estar n a la orden del d a y seguiremos en la lucha porque no hay ninguna intenci n de desarmar el modelo de agronegocios ni distribuci n de tierras ni cuestionamientos al actual uso de la tierra la discusi n es entre empresarios del campo y politiqueros de doble discurso
154608 se trata de un conflicto por dinero y poder ni siquiera hay una discusi n ideol gica todos ellos entienden la tierra como una mercanc a y pelean por ver qui n se queda con la mayor parte las cuatro entidades son totalmente opuestas a nuestra ideolog a con un trasfondo hist rico que a n no est saldado donde hubo usurpaci n y desaparici n de una gran parte de nuestro pueblo no nos olvidamos de ese crimen
154609 el gobierno no tiene una pol tica real para cambiar la realidad de los m s necesitados y mucho menos para los pueblos ind genas

154612 reforma agraria integral y soberan a alimentaria que es la posibilidad de que el pa s tenga su propio proyecto alimentario y no que las multinacionales impongan qu se debe producir
154613 las llamadas entidades del campo s lo pronuncian los dictados de los agronegocios su s mbolo actual es la soja transg nica que ha devastado bosques desalojado comunidades contaminado suelos y aumentado los precios de los alimentos en el mercado interno el avance del modelo sojero iniciado durante el menemismo y acentuado en esta d cada significa un desierto verde y contaminado sin agricultores y ciudades saturadas de familias expulsadas de las zonas rurales
154614 el gobierno provincial alienta cuatro polos productivos la industria del az car y el tabaco el turismo y la miner a todas ellas atentan contra nuestros territorios y nuestra forma de vida
154615 repudiamos las pol ticas de exclusi n y saqueo de los territorios en que vivimos pol ticas promovidas por los grupos econ micos que tienen como c mplices a los gobiernos de turno
154616 el campo profundo reclama tierra que no se destruya m s el medio ambiente agua y reclama pol ticas para frenar el xodo hacia las ciudades y todo esto no depende de las retenciones depende de pol ticas reales que ning n gobierno impulsa
154617 la faa no dice que sus afiliados con la complicidad del sistema pol tico y jur dico desalojan campesinos y sinceremos que esos productores no cosechan alimentos en beneficio del pueblo producen forrajes para la especulaci n en el mercado externo

154622 el recurso extraordinario cuya denegaci n dio origen a esta queja no se dirige contra una sentencia definitiva o equiparable a tal

makan daging bukan masalah pilihan personal lagi kita tidak bebas memilih ketika pilihan itu nyata mengancam keberlangsungan hidup setiap makhluk dan entitas di muka bumi ini seperti yang ditekankan oleh worldwatch institute dalam artikel mereka global warming dapat dipahami sebagai naiknya suhu rata rata permukaan bumi salah satu penyebabnya adalah aktivitas manusia yang menyumbang 90 gas rumah kaca di atmosfer gas rumah kaca sendiri berfungsi untuk menjaga suhu bumi agar berada pada kisaran layak huni yakni 14 5 derajat celcius tidak seperti bulan yang memiliki suhu 18 derajat celcius gas rumah kaca memerangkap panas dari matahari ketika sinar matahari mencapai atmosfer bumi sebagian akan dipantulkan dalam bentuk infra merah dan sebagian lagi diteruskan ke permukaan bumi permukaan bumi memantulkan kembali panas tersebut dan sebagian diperangkap oleh gas gas rumah kaca co2 karbondioksida ch4 metana n2o dinitrooksida semakin banyak konsentrasi gas rumah kaca semakin banyak panas yang terperangkap yang akan meningkatkan suhu rata rata di permukaan bumi gas rumah kaca ibarat selimut bumi semakin bertambah ketebalannya maka semakin gerahlah suhu bumi perlu diketahui daya perangkap panas ch4 adalah 25 kali co2 sedangkan n20 daya perangkap panasnya hingga 296 kali co2 konsentrasi co2 saat ini adalah 380 bps bagian per sejuta atau part per million ada sumber yang merujuk angka 450 bps sebagai ambang bumi mencerna co2 namun james hansen ahli iklim nasa mematok angka 350 bps dengan batas ambang kenaikan suhu adalah pada kisaran 2 derajat celcius lebih dari ambang ini bumi akan memasuki kekacauan ilklim yang tidak terkendali data dari bulan oktober 2007 kenaikan suhu bumi telah mencapai 0 5 derajat celcius darimana sajakah datangnya gas gas rumah kaca ini yang dikeluarkan

154783 this has been a difficult day for me this is the only family i have know in england professionally i dont know how im going to handle it
154784 i came to the club wanting to play my part in promotion to help the other players and the coaches realise this dream so i feel i have failed on my part not to have done that
154785 ive given it my best and i wish the club well ive said it before and ill always say it again this is a big club in the country a big club in the world its a premier league club everything evolves around the premier league at wolves and i just hope they can reach it
154786 the last two seasons have shown how things can change we went from nothing to something two years ago and now there is strong competition all through the club
154787 i believe in this manager as both a man and as a professional i believe in the additions he has made i believe in the team im leaving behind and i believe its going to happen for them this season
154788 i know wolves fans have grown tired of hearing that but it is what i feel
154789 we have got things in motion the difficulty is in getting real quality players everybody is finding the same all the clubs of a similar position to ourselves are in exactly the same boat
154790 what i will say is that we are working as hard as we possibly can to improve our squad which is what we need to do
154791 the fact is we need to improve our squad to stand still never mind anything else thats the difficulty
154792 we finished sixth last season and for us to stand still we need to improve the squad
154793 so for us to go forward we are looking at a sizeable squad and quality players if we can do it that is our aim for us to really make progress we have got to improve the side the strength and the quality of the squad
154794 players particularly those coming from abroad want to play in the premier league and there are only so many teams that can be in europe each year
154795 to be able to say to prospective signings we are in the uefa cup certainly wont hinder our chances
154796 everyone knows what i think of ashley and he had a great first full season here i gave him a free sort of role towards the end of the season rather than asking him just to stay on the left wing and he was immense he is capable of anything
154797 he looked a threat for most of the season hes been getting back already in the build up to this season to the form of last year more quickly than we would have imagined
154798 it is an interesting time it is an exciting time as well we are well aware of what we have to do but we are not starting to worry about a clock running down
154799 what we have to do is get ourselves prepared the truth is for us to be competing again we need to be competing immediately as soon as the premier league season kicks off from day one that is our aim
154800 friedel is an absolutely quality goalkeeper i think he will do great for us by all accounts hes a great character and a great character in the dressing room i am sure the signing will be a lift for everyone
154801 sidwell is another good signing for us he is definitely capable of scoring a few goals and weve got to play him in that role where he can maybe get forward to achieve that
154802 this distribution model will allow us and our partners to host the game on regular internet websites and will allow our customers to access games outside of their mobile operator space as well as pick a pricing model that suits their needs fully

154809 using il 8 as a biomarker to screen low risk septic shock patients from clinical trials of experimental or potentially high risk therapies is an effective strategy to improve the risk to benefit ratio of a given intervention
154810 excluding patients who respond to standard care would enable investigators to focus clinical trial enrollment on patients least likely to respond well to conventional methods and find the most effective new therapies
154811 in countries with low prevalence of initial multi drug resistance the standardized treatment regimens for new case appear to be adequate wrote dick menzies m
154812 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to reevaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
154813 we hypothesized that in countries using standardized initial and retreatment regimens the proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes would be correlated with prevalence of initial and acquired multi drug resistance
154814 this is striking evidence that mdr tb is directly linked to the increased failure rates of our current treatment regimens
154815 in the short term the higher the failure and relapse rates mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the long term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
154816 unless those with the responsibility to boost control and research efforts increase their commitments and their financial investments by several fold we may never see elimination of this major scourge in the decades to come

154841 perot systems the book does do a good job of describing how eight high velocity companies have used what champy described as surprising counterintuitive lessons to grow into industry leaders in a short amount of time the surprising counterintuitive lessons are compete by seeing what others dont compete by thinking outside the bubble compete by using all you know compete by doing everything yourself compete by tapping the success of others compete by creating order out of chaos compete by simplifying complexity the book is split into chapters with each chapter covering a different lesson each lesson is presented to the reader by describing an organization that used that lesson to become successful and why that lesson should be considered by other companies each chapter closes with questions that you can ask yourself and or your organization to see if you can tap into these lessons to grow and become more competitive good to great

154883 liran sta giustiziando diversi minori ogni anno nonostante sia una pratica bandita dal diritto internazionale
154884 gi crudele e disumano applicare la pena di morte agli adulti ma lo ancora di pi nel caso di individui condannati per crimini commessi prima di compiere i 18 anni di et
154885 il diritto internazionale prevede il divieto assoluto di giustiziare minorenni questo testimonia che il mondo aborrisce questa pratica
154886 tempo che i funzionari giudiziari iraniani e gli altri leader diano ascolto alle preoccupazioni di diversi giuristi avvocati e attivisti per i diritti umani in iran che hanno lanciato ripetuti appelli alle autorit perch mettano fine alle esecuzioni di minori e assicurino che liran onori i propri impegni giuridici internazionali
154887 le esecuzioni di mozafari e shahidi sono un fatto piuttosto inquietante
154888 il fatto che le famiglie delle vittime di un omicidio abbiano perdonato altri due accusati minorenni appena qualche giorno prima delle ultime esecuzioni non fa altro che sottolineare larbitrariet del sistema giudiziario iraniano
154889 le autorit iraniane dovrebbero smetterla di trovare scuse e cambiare le loro leggi in modo da garantire che nessuno venga pi giustiziato per un crimine commesso prima dei 18 anni
154890 le continue esecuzioni di minorenni in iran sono un fenomeno molto preoccupante poich rivelano la precisa volont di ignorare il diritto internazionale e gli obblighi delliran
154891 e anche le impiccagioni di massa come quella di 29 uomini giustiziati nella prigione di evin il 27 luglio trasmettono il chiaro messaggio di un sistema giudiziario sanguinario che vuole intimidire la popolazione con la sua tendenza a ricorrere alla violenza estrema
154892 scandaloso che non siano neanche stati resi noti pubblicamente i nomi di tutti gli individui giustiziati per non parlare dei crimini di cui erano accusati e delle prove contro di loro
154893 liran sta cercando di dimostrare di avere sotto controllo la situazione interna mentre impegnato nei negoziati sul nucleare ma per farlo ricorre a metodi tanto violenti che in realt dimostra solo il suo profondo senso di insicurezza
154894 abbiamo assistito a fin troppi casi caratterizzati da gravi violazioni del diritto iraniano e internazionale che si sono conclusi con lesecuzione del condannato minorenne
154895 non c giustizia in un sistema in cui i giudici dei tribunali possono violare ripetutamente le procedure senza dover subire nessuna misura disciplinare e le corti dappello decretano pessime sentenze
154896 se liran vuole che il mondo ne riconosca lautorit deve comportarsi di conseguenza e questo significa mettere fine a tutte le esecuzioni di condannati minorenni e impegnarsi in serie riforme giudiziarie
154897 con la sua pratica di giustiziare condannati minorenni liran si guadagnato la pessima fama di essere lultimo boia di minori rimasto al mondo
154898 crediamo che non sia questo che gli iraniani vogliono e che cos sar impossibile costruire una cultura dei diritti umani pi solida per liran del domani
154899 teniamo presente che questestate ricorre il ventesimo anniversario delle esecuzioni di massa di oltre 4mila prigionieri politici giustiziati nelle prigioni iraniane nel 1988 proprio in coincidenza con ladesione delliran alla risoluzione onu che metteva fine alla guerra iran iraq
154900 laumento del numero di esecuzioni un indicatore delle politiche di quellepoca volte a tenere sotto controllo ogni possibile elemento di disturbo
154901 it is important for tasmanians to have confidence in our government they want to trust politicians as much as they can and they want to know there are processes in place to ensure that parliamentarians and indeed members of the public service are doing the best possible job they can
154902 what we need is a body that can investigate can compel witnesses and documents before it is able to be independent of government and get to the bottom of scandals weve seen unravel in recent years
154903 ive gone from being someone who stopped in at a pub several times a week when i was younger and practically living there when i was a student to hating pubs many of the establishments are so pressed for custom that they will do anything to fill their bar mainly selling toxic drinks in devastating quantities to kids who consider a good night out to be one that ends in copious vomiting i grew up knowing very well the dangers of excessive drinking but most of that was done in private at home or in the street while social drinking was a matter for the pub on coronation street the rovers return seemed a perfectly typical hub of community life where believe it or not conversations took place and business was done and views were exchanged young and old used to meet in the pub as did the differently educated in corrie ken barlow would be at one end of the bar reading the london review of books while his rival mike baldwin would be at the other end chatting up the barmaid

154905 its important to carry out a new strategy to seek economic growth
154906 as a cabinet we are not working just for the sake of approval ratings
154907 what voters want isnt a change of ministers but a change to policies that will safeguard peoples lives
154908 we are determined to change the government in upcoming elections
154909 this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support
154910 to tide over what appears to be the biggest crisis since the partys foundation
154911 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight
154912 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged
154913 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
154914 following in depth discussions and after hearing the demands of all sides we deem that the financial conditions allowing a major development in britain by edf have not currently been met
154915 the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular edf deal
154916 i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations
154917 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
154918 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
154919 we expect our fuel bill to top three billion pounds this year the equivalent of more than eight million pounds every day
154920 since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions we have reduced capacity in the winter schedule without compromising our network and at the same time we have the flexibility in the business to capitalise when conditions improve
154921 we have revised our capital expenditure plans and are focusing on cost control

154927 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
154928 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
154929 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
154930 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
154931 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
154932 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
154933 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
154934 thats a definition of madness but thats what john mccain is offering hes offering bush economic policies and karl rove politics
154935 what theyre going to argue is im too risky the real risk is that we miss the moment that we do not do whats needed because were afraid
154936 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
154937 these anxieties seem to be growing with each passing day
154938 we can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what weve been doing my opponent john mccain thinks were on the right track

154961 under this agreement safeguards would be applied to nuclear facilities in india using the same methods as applied elsewhere in the world
154962 without this agreement the safeguards activities and the assurance of peaceful use provided by them will not be possible
154963 the question is can india end safeguards if fuel supplies are interrupted even if theyve conducted a nuclear test or does the agreement require permanent unconditional safeguards

154975 ms spears is reluctantly agreeing to extend the temporary conservatorship
154976 thats fresh news he was not drunk he was drinking hours and hours before
154977 the first irregularity i would mention is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
154978 data protection is the number one concern of chief information security officers but todays dlp solutions take too long to deploy and obtain results
154979 with the pending acquisition of reconnex mcafee expects to redefine the entire data protection market by bringing together a leader in the hottest segment with our comprehensive portfolio of data protection technologies we expect that this will enable us to leapfrog other data protection vendors and to reinforce our position as the largest dedicated security company
154980 a throwback to classic 80s buddy cop movies in the vein of lethal weapon and 48 hrs but with a modern spin
154981 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
154982 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
154983 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
154984 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
154985 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
154986 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
154987 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
154988 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
154989 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
154990 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
154991 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
154992 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
154993 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
154994 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
154995 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
154996 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
154997 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
154998 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
154999 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
155000 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
155001 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
155002 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
155003 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
155004 until now there hasnt been a reliable way to tell if somebody a hacker an isp corporate firewall or the great firewall of china is modifying your internet traffic en route
155005 the few tests available have been for narrow and specific kinds of interference or have required tremendous amounts of advanced forensic labor switzerland is designed to make general purpose isp testing faster and easier
155006 it was strange because as soon as i joined twente i knew we had the draw coming up
155007 i expected one of the english teams i think fate deals you certain cards and it has dealt us this draw
155008 on one hand its very very tough for us but on the other it is very exciting
155009 i think of all the teams we could have had that is the toughest or one of the toughest
155010 obviously we looked at arsenal liverpool juventus schalke and we got one of the most difficult
155011 in one respect its a tough draw for us on the other its now an opponent we know very well not just myself everyone in holland knows the premier league well so arsenal will be no strangers to us
155012 this is a reward for a great achievement last season in reaching this stage to get one of the big teams
155013 it will be a once in a lifetime experience that doesnt come along that often im sure the fans will be delighted
155014 we will be pleased with the draw logistically holland isnt too far and it will give our fans the opportunity to see the game
155015 as you rightly say its a reunion with steve and we are looking forward to it
155016 when steve was first team coach for the national team and then manager they used to use our training ground at london colney so there are good relations there
155017 i still contend that because of the nature of the snake there was no risk to the public
155018 if you read the literature it says the vipers bites are pretty benign
155019 but if you look at the experiences people have had in last decade some of those are pretty bad
155020 id hear a song on the radio and wish mine was next but i respect a lot of the artists whove come along since i was out especially rihanna shes smart and shes worked the business instead of having the business work her
155021 ive been planning my wedding in my head since i was a little girl and it just keeps getting more elaborate im a huge fan of the caribbean so if i dont get married in new york it would have to be on the beach
155022 id hear a song on the radio and wish mine was next but i respect a lot of the artists whove come along since i was out
155023 so much worse could happen but it makes you feel like youve been invaded someone is taking liberties on your property that you would never take with anyone else
155024 if youre just driving around you might not notice it
155025 kerajaan juga menjamin bahawa harga runcit petrol tidak akan melebihi rm2 70 seliter pada tahun ini
155026 many of westcoasts resellers currently only talk to their customers about hardware or software by offering them access to an experienced team that understands b2b mobiles and all the tariffs that are available we are helping our resellers move into other areas of business and to increase their revenue opportunities for the end user the ability of a reseller to offer a fully converged mobile data solution is a key selling point
155027 data protection is the number one concern of chief information security officers but todays dlp solutions take too long to deploy and obtain results
155028 with the pending acquisition of reconnex mcafee expects to redefine the entire data protection market by bringing together a leader in the hottest segment with our comprehensive portfolio of data protection technologies we expect that this will enable us to leapfrog other data protection vendors and to reinforce our position as the largest dedicated security company

155033 we had an illness outbreak that resulted in the premature euthanasia of about 56 animals
155034 the shelter design lends itself to outbreaks but even if we have a new state of the art shelter we could still face outbreaks but hopefully reduce the likelihood
155035 i have nothing against a new shelter if we get enough funds but the best thing you can do is to avoid putting the shelter in different areas
155036 that would be a transportation nightmare running animals all over the county having the animals in one area is much easier for the public

155041 what we will end up with in the end is a better idea of what we will need for our communications system in oswego county
155042 there are many areas of the county where coverage is unreliable
155043 our goal should be nothing less than a modern system in which coverage is reliable and complete all year round and in every single part of the county
155044 it is going to take a couple of months to get the report together
155045 once the first phase is complete the legislature will have the information it needs on what it will cost how it will work and what type it will be so it can begin to go about financing it
155046 this will create a document that we can use to seek qualified vendors to build the system for us
155047 the legislature can then decide if we can do it
155048 i expect the report to be done within four to six months
155049 by the first part of the year we will get the report in hand

155051 i am looking forward to returning to america and challenging malignaggi for his title
155052 las vegas is a second home for me the fans treat me like gold and i promise them another value for money fight
155053 hatton is an aggressive puncher who swarms his opponents from start to finish while malignaggi is one of the purest boxers in the game today
155054 as a fan i am excited to see if hatton can lure malignaggi into a brawl or if malignaggi can dictate the tempo and make the fight his no matter what happens i think when their styles collide its going to make for great action and great drama
155055 the market is selling off because of the weak economic numbers out of the u s
155056 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think emerging market demand will compensate for that
155057 the overall momentum on crude oil has clearly changed from the dynamics of the first half of the year
155058 prices will likely correct over the next six months to the 100 to 110 range
155059 there arent enough fundamental factors right now pushing prices higher
155060 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of most iconic brands of the 20th century
155061 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank and we wanted to give it back to those consumers
155062 for many years the product was associated with happy times especially to people my age
155063 as we all know the world is not the best it can be today we used to think those were hard times and when we look back on them those were the good old days
155064 they decided not to pull their product off the shelf
155065 they decided to weather the storm and sell that product thats the worst possible mistake they could have made
155066 the claim of legality is certainly likely to be challenged by apple

155068 we have made it clear all along in our discussions with the public and climate camp representatives that we wanted to police lawful protest recognising this is the right of people in a free country
155069 however equipment seized from the site suggests some protestors were clearly intent on unlawful action
155070 these included bolt croppers super glue padded suits climbing ropes and pipes adapted in a way used at other protests to lock protestors to fences and machinery
155071 it is hard to conceive some of the equipment being used for anything other than unlawful use
155072 i fail to see how trying to disrupt the provision of sanitation and water to a peaceful protest is anything other than underhanded and inflammatory
155073 as a local resident and supporter of the camp i feel that is a disgraceful and unwarranted action
155074 we are really disappointed that after so many weeks of carefully building up good relations with the police they would choose to behave in such an unjustifiably heavy handed manner
155075 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
155076 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
155077 we expect our fuel bill to top three billion pounds this year the equivalent of more than eight million pounds every day
155078 since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions we have reduced capacity in the winter schedule without compromising our network and at the same time we have the flexibility in the business to capitalise when conditions improve
155079 we have revised our capital expenditure plans and are focusing on cost control
155080 im moment f hre ich und ich habe alle bestzeiten geholt es l uft nicht so schlecht
155081 ich werde weiter versuchen meinen vorsprung zu vergr ern aber ich wei nicht ob es reicht
155082 ich bin noch nicht weit zur ck und ich fighte wie h lle wir werden sehen wie es weiter geht
155083 diese rolle w rde ich nicht spielen wollen ich w re viel lieber f nfter oder sechster mit renault als vierter oder f nfter mit mclaren wenn ich nun f r mclaren fahren w rde dann w rde ich mich wom glich in derselben position wie jetzt befinden ohne die m glichkeit zu haben rennen zu gewinnen
155084 ich bin gl cklich bei renault zu sein die volle unterst tzung des teams zu genie en alle arbeiten tag und nacht um mir das beste auto zur verf gung zu stellen
155085 ich bin 27 jahre alt und habe noch viele jahre vor mir selbst michael schumacher verbrachte bei ferrari vier jahre w hrend denen er nicht gewann ich wei dass ich geduldig sein muss und h rter als jemals zuvor arbeiten muss um wieder gewinnen zu k nnen
155086 in prison i started to see how disgusting it was and i saw how difficult it was for the people who cared for me
155087 when i was transferred to an adult prison for the first time i saw men in there who were old enough to be my dad thats when i realised i couldnt stay in prison
155088 i remember leaving prison and the officer saying theyd see me back at christmas i said no thanks and never went back
155089 if i was told back then that id suffer for the next ten years just trying to break even getting a job or references i would have thought twice about it
155090 does this signify a softening of chinas policy on censorship

155115 we owe a debt of gratitude to farm bureau and the farmers of ohio to allow us to have the life we have here in ohio and across the united states if you think about what our lives would be like without agriculture or farm bureau there would be a very long list of how different it would be
155116 we are happy that statewide officials take the time to learn more about the issues of ohio agriculture and the importance of the industry to ohios economy

155123 die fantastische uefa euro 2008 in sterreich und der schweiz liegt noch nicht lange zur ck
155124 auf fu ballerischer seite haben wir einige tolle spiele gesehen in denen dramatik spannung und tore zu sehen waren alles was man f r ein gro es turnier braucht au erdem war es toll wie gezeigt wurde dass offensivfu ball durchaus erfolgreich sein kann
155125 ebenfalls wichtig war dass zwischen den fans spielern und offiziellen der gedanke des gegenseitigen respekts gelebt wurde auf allerh chstem niveau
155126 wenn es also eine botschaft gibt die ich ihnen heute mit auf den weg geben will dann m chte ich dass sie auch in den n chsten runden vor allem auf eines achten den respekt es ist wichtig f r den fu ball ihn abseits und auf den rasen zu demonstrieren
155127 i want to become a successful driver in this team and hopefully we can announce at some point in the future that i can stay here for many many years

155129 der uefa pokal ist europas gr ter vereinswettbewerb an dem mannschaften aus ganz europa teilnehmen

155132 wer die zweite qualifikationsrunde bersteht nimmt am 29 august an der auslosung der ersten runde in monaco teil bersteht man auch die erste runde schafft es ein verein in die gruppenphase des uefa pokals die im oktober beginnt es geht also um alles
155133 au erdem hat die em gezeigt dass fair play und respekt zwischen den fans spielern und den offiziellen wirklich m glich ist und dieser ausdruck des respekts der auch von den medien gew rdigt wurde war f r die uefa das wichtigste weil die kampagne uns sehr am herzen lag

155142 in our view the best way is to try to help the poor by direct income support targeted safety nets like food for work programs and to avoid general subsidies which waste resources and dont help the poor
155143 for food an increase in supply is needed but production is not enough we need to be able to carry what has been produced from one country to another
155144 the failure of the wto world trade organization talks is not good news

155146 the men will now return immediately to the uk and take up their public duties which include protecting her majesty
155147 hes going to do exactly what he did with detroit and if he wants to do more he can certainly do that
155148 we are just excited to have him here working with us
155149 i wont have to travel any more than i want to and i will go to the scouting meeting and offer my two cents
155150 and they want me to talk to denis savard just like i talked to mike in detroit
155151 hes battled quite a bit the last year and a half with the recurrence of hodgkins and hes doing pretty well right now and this might give him a boost as well
155152 and the fact they have don a lot of exciting things on and off the ice interests me you have to play on the ice but i think they are really on their way
155153 i got to know gordie pretty well in the last 15 years and he told me he had a lot of highlights in his career but if he had to pick one highlight it would have been playing with mark and marty
155154 im not a player but its a similar situation because i get to work with family
155155 im disappointed hes going for me personally for us professionally
155156 but when there were rumors about him going to toronto a year ago i said this entire organization is indebted to scotty for what he did from 1994 to 2002 and we have to support him in whatever decision he wants to make

155222 ja det synes jeg absolutt dette er en type leksikon som blir mer og mer dominerende
155223 jeg tror dessverre at det blir vanskelig publisering p wikipedia er en helt individuell virksomhet som derfor er vanskelig styre i tillegg er publiseringen anonym noe som gj r det enda vanskeligere engasjere forskere fordi de ikke f r noen form for uttelling slik det er n er det bare uegennyttig formidlingstrang eller pedantiske behov for rette p feil som kan f forskere til engasjere seg dette er leit for nettopp forskere kan tilf re wikipedia den kvalitetssikringen som er n dvendig for at det skal bli en n yaktig og etterrettelig kunnskapskilde jeg synes for vrig at man allerede p ungdomsskolen og i den videreg ende skolen burde gi elevene mer oppl ring i kildekritikk ikke minst med tanke p fornuftig bruk av wikipedia som oppslagsverk

155332 there was some early uproar when facebook first permitted applications about some of the music sharing apps
155333 what ultimately happened then was that the music sharing apps very rapidly were tweaked so that people werent doing any actual file sharing
155334 hasbro certainly couldve saber rattled and pushed the issue with facebook
155335 particularly under the grokster decision from a few years back facebook has to be very careful even if its getting indemnity from the people who are putting applications on the site that indemnity might not amount to much if theres very little there to back it up
155336 in fact in last weeks f8 conference announcement they said they are trying to award and sort out the good applications versus the not so good ones
155337 its posturing but its the way that they are ensuring that theyre not in bed with their application makers for this purpose

155339 i think that this is a questionable area of intellectual property law and its not clear cut
155340 when things arent clear cut you dont necessarily go and cut off peoples access to platforms
155341 the thing is theres 400 000 developers using facebooks platform and theyre trying to find ways to be successful and that means copying games that are going to work
155342 theyre clearly trying to segment quality apps that help the user experience versus ones that dont
155343 if you dont make the problems public the companies dont fix them and the consumers buy shoddy stuff
155344 the concept of responsible disclosure is well and good for new locks that havent hit the market yet but that doesnt help you when the lock is already embedded in millions of facilities theyre not going to fix them
155345 how does it help the consumer not to tell them that there is a vulnerability
155346 medeco customers have a right to know whether their locks can be compromised
155347 we believe that lock picking obviously is an illicit activity even if its a sport we frown on all of that even if its for fun
155348 as new technologies have become available that is what spurred product innovation and that spurs development of new standards
155349 our responsibility is to make changes when we see a change in the state of the art
155350 everybody has some responsibility to not disclose things that can hurt people and that people dont have power over changing
155351 is it a known vulnerability if people dont know about it
155352 im not sure you need to worry about it unless people are out there demonstrating it and showing how to do it
155353 the assumption is that the criminals dont know about it
155354 criminals know how to pick locks the secrecy just hides the truth from the consumer
155355 the goal is to make security better as soon as its not responsible to do research the bad guys win
155356 the lock picking industry doesnt get this because theyre basically still a guild a secret knowledge kind of field whereas computer security is always built on open knowledge
155357 there have been insecurities discovered by computer people turned locksmiths that have existed for hundreds of years
155358 let them make their security assessments based on how secure they are told the locks are
155359 but in the real world individual privacy is fundamentally important and is being chipped away bit by bit every day by companies like google

155456 he is claiming that what were doing somehow has racial overtones says mccain campaign manager rick davis
155457 to be honest i dont know how else you explain the quote about the dollar bills other than to believe that somehow barack obama was calling something we had done racist

155529 there were another two ewes nearby that couldnt get up because they were in such poor condition
155530 the officers found a further seven dead sheep and another three in a very poor state
155531 these sheep clearly needed veterinary attention and it was clear the farmer had failed to supply supplementary feeding
155532 i had started to feed my sheep but the weather conditions deteriorated badly i obviously hadnt given them enough food
155533 the sheep that died were elderly and it had been a mistake to try and get another season out of them i realize now that i made mistakes
155534 i went in the afternoon for a look and from the road saw around six carcasses
155535 i returned the following day and there now appeared to be 10 carcasses in the field
155536 a good farmer should be checking his stock on a daily basis and i thought he would have cleared up the carcasses from the previous day
155537 we wanted to establish what was happening to the sheep
155538 i believed we were allowed to enter the land these sheep required attention
155539 i say the sspca did require a warrant the search was unlawful
155540 the sspca had been monitoring the situation from the roadway they did not think it necessary to take immediate action on either of those days they should have been aware a warrant was required
155541 these men arent lawyers they thought if animals were suffering they could go into these fields and do something about it
155542 i argue that they can still give eye witness evidence even if the photographs pathologists results from the carcasses and the mapping was deemed inadmissible
155543 there is great public concern about cruelty to animals and there is great public interest in bringing people who are cruel to animals to justice
155544 the results of the survey demonstrate that there really is something for everyone on a holiday in scotland scotland offers a wide range of fascinating adventures for all ages
155545 we are delighted with these results we were worried about the recent financial climate but at present were up on our numbers from last year
155546 we put this down to people who were maybe going abroad for a week or two cutting back and coming here for a pampering instead
155547 visitscotland has recognised the potential impact of the current economic climate and
155548 we recognise that there could be difficult times ahead but by working together for a common
155549 this is the single biggest investment in tweeddale and im delighted that its gone ahead i would hope that we can now put all the furore behind us
155550 these state of the art schools will bring wonderful facilities for pupils staff and their communities
155551 i was delighted that the contracts for both schools were within our original budgets which will enable us to progress with confidence our plans to build new schools for halyrude caddonfoot and west linton
155552 i would like to thank everyone who has supported us over the past three years this new kingsland will build on the reputation and traditions of the old school in rosetta road and be a wonderful icon for peebles like pupils parents and our staff i am looking forward to the opening ceremony
155553 it is the schools decision to decide on the name and i respect that decision i applaud the pupil council for the democratic way in which they resolved the issue
155554 halyrude will also have this option when they move into the kingsland building so at least the name and history will survive
155555 first we worked on mcgilvrays fruit farm picking strawberries and potatoes then we were moved over to richardsons farm where we tended the cattle it was hard work and long hours from 7am 6pm in all seasons
155556 we had a great time there was fantastic camararderie between all us girls its a real pity though that so many of the girls are not here to receive their honour because without us the country would have collapsed
155557 alex used to love his gardening and would never let me touch it i used to have to remind him that i was in the land army sowing and picking vegetables in hard frost
155558 i applied for my medal a couple of months back and then forgot about it last wednesday night i saw the land girls on the news at downing street and i woke next morning to find it in my post it was a lovely surprise
155559 wed be picked up at 8am and driven to different farms to work for the day planting and picking fruit and vegetables wed have to work until 11pm during the harvesting season threshing the wheat which was real hard work
155560 i remember once walking through a field and the ground opened up before me and these three airmen jumped out they had built a little house below ground level and it was rather lovely inside i wouldnt have minded living in it
155561 i lied about my age to join because all my brothers and sisters were in the armed services however i wanted to be different to them so thats why i joined the land army
155562 at the time i was also suffering from rheumatic fever and the doctor told me it would toughen me up
155563 to be honest its about time that they were honoured for what they did because without them the country would have starved during the war
155564 it is a disaster area and a roundabout would end almost al of the problems speed is the real issue just now and a roundabout would slow cars down
155565 we were told some time ago that a roundabout was coming where has it gone
155566 during the last year some temporary works to improve the existing junction have been carried out and some preliminary design work for a roundabout has also been undertaken
155567 however as sestran no longer receives direct funding from the scottish government midlothian council in conjunction with sestran and neighbouring authorities is investigating alternative methods of funding this project
155568 i certainly dont believe there should be any delays with these safety measures
155569 funding had been secured and the detailed designs have been done
155570 leadburn is clearly a problem area for accidents and work should take place sooner rather than later i will be asking midlothian council for assurances
155571 the man was stopped and advised that such an unusual sight particularly in a built up area may be misinterpreted as threatening by members of the public
155572 im putting a call out to men and women who are fans of both sports and also to those who may be interested in having a go at one of scotlands oldest games
155573 the borders has been a shinty area in the past on december 4 1815 walter scott and the ettrick shepherd james hogg were among a 2 000 strong crowd at carterhaugh near selkirk teams put up by the duke of buccleuch and the earl of home had an old fashioned four hour plus marathon of a match
155574 to be frank i wish to say that at the moment in xinjiang there are only a limited number of sabotage activities by east turkestan forces or groups
155575 these terrorists groups are not at all as capable as some media organizations have said
155576 a very small number of sabotage activities and many of them have been stopped in the early days
155577 with our experience in dealing with terrorists especially the east turkestan islamic movement over the past years we are confident that we can thwart any terrorist activities in time
155578 other anti china forces at home and abroad so long as they engage in sabotage activities or any kind of destabilization
155579 the government has been very worried about the security situation there
155580 they have limited access to the region by journalists and scholars so it is really hard to know exactly whats going on
155581 most people feel that there have not been that many serious incidents to warrant that high level of security in the region
155582 we anticipate that the fall introduction of 2009 model year vehicles will cause overall industry level incentives to decline in the coming months
155583 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting radpily to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations

155604 i think its fair to say that but like i said j t osullivan has to stay ready i want him to get enough work that he can stay in tune with his skills and compete if he has to but right now from a repetition standpoint theres no getting around that two guys are going to take more of the reps and its probably going to stay that way for a while

155609 big white p on a yellow license plate that says the driver works for an accredited photo agency
155610 regulating the paparazzi wont bring an end to modern day media coverage just as the newly enforced hands free law hasnt stopped people from talking on cell phones while they drive
155611 its only an adaptive measure put in place to respond to some of the ways that living in a technological free market can compromise personal safety
155612 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
155613 if the ones that attract the paparazzi behave in the first place like we expect of anybody that solves about 90 percent of the problem the rest we can deal with

155643 oh schon f nfmal dann wird es zeit dass sich das ndert obwohl unser williams toyota konkurrenzf hig war haben wir in einigen der zur ckliegenden rennen keine punkte gesammelt weil wir in unf lle verwickelt waren aber bez glich der geschwindigkeit waren wir dabei der hungaroring liegt uns besser da ist ein weiches auto gefragt er ist ein ziemlich anderer kurs als die zur ckliegenden er ist mit monaco vergleichbar da ist ein anderes set up gefragt zudem ist es in budapest immer sehr hei weshalb das rennen sehr hart ist mit der hitze kommt keiner wirklich klar aber ich f hle mich sehr fit und hoffe so auf einen kleinen vorteil gegen ber anderen
155644 bei einem guten qualifying sind punkte drin wir hatten im vorjahr ein gutes qualifying und waren dann im rennen gut unterwegs ich denke wir k nnen zuversichtlich sein dass wir konkurrenzf hig sind und ein gutes wochenende erleben werden das hei t ein paar punkte holen
155645 ja wir sind zur ckgefallen red bull toyota und renault mit denen wir uns vergleichen k nnen sind jetzt einfach schneller es ist fraglich ob wir den r ckstand schon in ungarn aufholen k nnen aber bei williams arbeiten wirklich alle hart zudem kommen jetzt kurse die uns liegen sollten budapest wie gesagt valencia und vielleicht auch singapur ich denke wir werden in der restlichen saison einige gute rennen haben
155646 ich habe f r 2009 einen vertrag mit williams damit ist klar f r wen ich fahre

155656 on behalf of all new yorkers we are pleased to welcome these students to our state university system and to ensure that there is no interruption in their college studies despite the tragic natural disaster that hit chengdu in may
155657 suny will provide these students with valuable leadership training which will help prepare them to return to china to assist with rebuilding efforts and the aftermath of the earthquake sunys deep educational ties with china allow our state university campuses to play a global role and to be at the forefront of international educational experiences
155658 the state university of new york has a long and mutually productive relationship with a number of chinese universities particularly in jiangsu province
155659 this initiative further strengthens sunys ties to china even as it provides desperately needed humanitarian support for students from sichuan province displaced by the devastating earthquake of last may it enjoys support at the highest levels of both the chinese government and our own
155660 we see this program the suny china 150 program not only as a way to grow educational cooperation and exchanges with suny but also as a critical first step in helping to expand mutually beneficial economic and commercial relations between sichuan province and new york state
155661 suny has been collaborating with chinese universities for more than 25 years
155662 i commend governor paterson for his support of china 150 and thank each of the suny campuses for their participation in this most important international initiative
155663 broadening our international relationship with china benefits suny and new york state as it will benefit the rebuilding effort in the sichuan province
155664 using education and partnership in response to such a disaster seemed a natural for suny
155665 recently i have also been advised that some of the ioc officials had negotiated with the chinese that some sensitive sites would be blocked
155666 if you have been misled by what i have told you about there being free internet access during the games then i apologise
155667 during the olympic games we will provide sufficient access to the internet for reporters
155668 our promise was that journalists would be able to use the internet for their work during the olympic games so we have given them sufficient access to do that
155669 it was my express belief that there would be open free and uncensored access to the internet during the games
155670 my preoccupation now is to ensure there is no impediment to reporting the games themselves
155671 i have no involvement in any of that and theres nothing i can do about it its in the hands of others
155672 it would appear that this is something that has been done at coordination commission level and that sort of detail doesnt come through to the membership
155673 if were on particular commissions we might be privy to information like that i certainly wasnt
155674 one of the most humbling things about your children is that you will begin to notice things you dont like about them as they grow up and then you will realize that the reason you dont like certain things about them is because they remind you of you

155680 i dont want my brother coming out of that toilet with just his in his hand
155681 lo sentii schioccare contro il marciapiede poi levarsi in aria in un sibilo e abbattersi sulla mia schiena nel momento esatto in cui raggiunsi lerba e qualcuno grid non fargli del male mintrufolai nella fila di cespugli e continuai a correre non sentivo dolore ma sapevo che mi stavo trascinando dietro qualcosa si pesante girai la testa e vidi che la gamba sinistra era tutta storta in modo innaturale mentre correvo non si muoveva cos me la trascinavo dietro come un sacco
155682 la mia gamba intanto stava guarendo abbastanza in fretta e nel giro di una settimana fui di nuovo in grado di reggermi e dopo qualche altro giorno non mi faceva quasi pi male anche se era ancora curva da allora sono rimasto zoppo zoppicare una bella parola fa quel che dice
155683 what you have here is a very typical 3 3 liter v6 directly mounted to the synergy drive which is quite honestly just a fairly simple electric generator
155684 once youre inside the perimeter of the vehicle it allows you to start the vehicle without you having to insert the key
155685 in order to start the vehicle you wanna put your foot on the break and push the power button
155686 as you pull away the vehicles ultra smooth theres no shifting
155687 and thats where its coming from the electric motor relying on battery power to keep the vehicle propelled
155688 it almost becomes a game to see just how good a mileage you can get
155689 it kind of trains us and we say hey this is where i was getting the most benefit and we start to change our habits a little bit
155690 the greatest benefit to a vehicle like this is the city gas mileage by having a 27 miles to the gallon in the city where as a traditional highlander is only 17 miles in the city
155691 upper 40s day in and day out for gas mileage which is absolutely incredible

155728 republican congressional candidate john gard said thursday he could not believe his opponent rep steve kagen said a surge of u s troops in iraq alone is not the reason for the quieting of the violence in that country
155729 he kagen has made over a dozen votes against our troops
155730 what i find most disappointing is that after spending several hours in iraq he diminishes the effort of our troops
155731 our brave soldiers deserve every credit for their efforts but by no means can people say the lull is anything but fragile
155732 highly offensive the numbers dont lie i dont know how he can make that comment
155733 were not just disrespectful of the troops but showed that he is out of touch

155740 the wild world is becoming so remote to children that they miss out and an interest in the natural world doesnt grow as it should
155741 nobody is going to protect the natural world unless they understand it
155742 the results reinforce the idea that many children dont spend enough time playing in the green outdoors and enjoying wildlife something older generations might have taken for granted
155743 play is the primary mechanism through which children engage and connect with the world and natural environments are particularly attractive inspiring and satisfying for kids something magical occurs when children and wild spaces mix

155758 the market is selling off because of the weak economic numbers out of the u s
155759 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think emerging market demand will compensate for that
155760 the overall momentum on crude oil has clearly changed from the dynamics of the first half of the year
155761 in the second quarter demand for oil remained robust driven by continued growth in asia and the middle east and despite signs of a slowdown in the atlantic basin
155762 there is no surprise but the main element is that the tax level is a bit lower

155765 but i said slavery with young people youngsters that european clubs are trying to get 13 14 and 15 years old boys and bring them to the big clubs this is in my expression this is modern slavery
155766 we should also protect the player and if the player wants to play somewhere else then a solution should be found
155767 because if he stays in a club where he does not feel comfortable to play then its not good for the player and for the club im always in favor to protect the player and if the player he wants to leave let him leave
155768 we have nothing to say fifa is not going to intervene let it be as it is now

155801 we have to be aware that only a tiny proportion of people with mental health problems commit homicide and not use these rare cases to build our mental health policies for the thousands of people
155802 there is a much increased perception that people with mental illness are violent
155803 it is ironic then that in the uk there has since the 1990s been a moral panic about homicides by people with mental disorders
155804 its a rather sad story of stereotyping of the mentally ill as dangerous and how mental health policy is so little influenced by evidence

155983 hoe het allemaal is begonnen wel ik had zo rond 1963 een blueskwartet in de stijl van memphis slim champion jack dupree roosevelt sykes dat was een los verband ontstaan uit de scouting het golden gate quartet e d sloeg nogal aan in dat milieu want ik moet eerlijk zeggen de popscene kende ik niet in die tijd
155984 van huis uit was ik immers met klassieke muziek grootgebracht zo ben ik jarenlang zanger geweest bij de schola cantorum van de kathedraal eerst als alt en later als bas want ik heb het nog lange tijd proberen te combineren dat kwam er echter op neer dat ik enkel nog de repetities meemaakte want als er een optreden van de schola voorzien was had ik meestal tevens een optreden van mijn jazzgroep
155985 blues en jazz heb ik leren kennen via mijn oudere broers zo ben ik eigenlijk reeds vanaf mijn twaalfde jaar in de ban van de zwarte muziek ik ging dus rechtstreeks naar de bron en niet via blanke bluesmensen als john mayall of alexis korner zoals jongens die uit de popscene kwamen dat w l deden anderzijds bestond er hier in tegenstelling tot in engeland geen echt bluescircuit zelfs om aan platen te geraken moest je onmogelijke toeren uithalen
155986 naar aanleiding van een optreden van champion jack dupree in de honky tonk jazzclub van dendermonde in 1966 ben ik dan in gesprek geraakt met de voorzitter piet heuvink die ons kwartet uitnodigde om eens een optreden te verzorgen in zijn club in de pauze heb ik dan een paar nummers met de jeggpap new orleans jazz band mee gespeeld die toen nog maar n of twee jaar bestond wanneer een maand later hun pianist vertrok hebben ze me dan gevraagd om zijn plaats in te nemen
155987 naast mijn pianowerk voor de jeggpap kwam ik er toch ook als zanger aan mijn trekken ik mag zelfs zeggen dat ik gedurende jaren de programmatie van jeggpap heb bepaald soms vroegen we ons zelfs af of we niet te v l vocale muziek brachten dat kwam natuurlijk omdat ik zo graag zong ik voel mij ook nu nog altijd op de eerste plaats zanger en dan pas pianist
155988 door mijn opzoekingswerk bracht ik ook veel nummers aan dat wil daarom niet zeggen dat ik al naar new orleans zelf was geweest ik heb storyville pas voor het eerst bezocht in 1974 maar in de jaren zeventig zijn er veel groepen van ginds naar ons land gekomen the king thomas band the joymakers the percy humphrey band enz door de interesse voor de muziek ben ik me uiteindelijk ook voor de stad gaan interesseren en eigenlijk is mijn solo carri re als ik dat zo mag noemen ook grotendeels van start gegaan door mijn contact met de stad
155989 dat kwam omdat me daar ter plaatse opgevallen is dat de muziek in new orleans veel rijker is dan alleen maar de traditionele jazzmuziek of de dixieland er is ook gospel blues cajun zydeco ragtime zelfs popmuziek het hart van afrika voel je beter kloppen in new orleans maar ook dat van ierland van pruisen van spanje van de cara ben en natuurlijk van frankrijk die smeltkroes d t is wat new orleans zo aantrekkelijk maakt zoals renaissancemuziek door een samenloop van omstandigheden hier in de nederlanden moest ontstaan zo moest ook die muziek d r ontstaan door die migratie door dat kruispunt van culturen
155990 ik herinner me in dat verband b v een house party bij louis nelson in new orleans die man speelde daar o m love me tender van elvis presley in feite is new orleans muziek dus g n verzameling van nummers maar wel een wijze van musiceren of nog meer dan dat het is zelfs een filosofie en dat hebben vele oude stijl muzikanten nog niet door
155991 vandaar ook dat ik niet graag heb dat men zegt dat ik covers breng ik noem dat interpretaties tenslotte sta ik als ik randy newman zing of tom waits op een even hoog peil als mannen die brahms zingen of schubert want dat zijn even grote componisten covers brengen dat betekent voor mij the beatles imiteren met een pruik op soundmix kortom
155992 wat maakt die muziek nu juist zo waardevol tenslotte is het eenvoudige muziek het gaat amper om twee of drie akkoorden ik vergelijk dat nogal eens met de schilderkunst perfecte leegheid noemen ze dat op de kunstacademie frans masereel is zo iemand met een paar trekken schetst die een ganse situatie dat kunnen enkel de grote meesters vandaar dat ik ook bij hen te rade ga en dat ik weinig eigen nummers breng maar of het nu een nummer van mij is of van iemand anders elk nummer dat ik zing bel f ik ook echt zelfs wanneer ik junko partner van james booker zing ik ben zelf geen junkie maar toch kan ik me ook daarin dan volledig inleven
155993 ik heb in new orleans zelf reeds opgetreden en daar heb ik goede kritieken gekregen en ooit zong ik hier in belgi eens een nummer met lillian boutt de amerikaanse blueszangeres na afloop zei ze me dat ik net dezelfde harmonie n had gezongen als haar vader dat vond ik een zeer mooi compliment
155994 mijn eerste elpee die nogal low budget was is opgenomen in het lemmensinstituut in leuven omdat ik van b hou en die vind je niet overal ik heb er zelf wel een staan maar mijn huis is dan weer niet als studio geschikt een b sendorfer als je daarmee zingt dan zing je met twee steinway is briljanter extraverter b sendorfer is introverter ook bij mijn latere opnames o a in het prachtige auditorium van de muziekacademie van merksem heb ik daarmee rekening gehouden
155995 die eerste elpee werd opgenomen na een optreden van jeggpap eigenlijk gaat dat niet natuurlijk maar ja toen waren we nog jong en onbezonnen lacht bijna al de elpees van jeggpap zijn trouwens ook zo opgenomen omdat de onderliggende filosofie was dat het spontaan moest klinken maar eigenlijk kun je maar spontaan klinken als je de partituur zeer goed beheerst als je technisch alles onder de knie hebt dan kan je pas beginnen met een interpretatie mensen die van een partituur spelen die interpreteren niet een goede interpretatie kan maar beginnen eens men de partituur opzij legt
155996 mijn elpees zijn meestal chte solo elpees ook al laat ik mij op een paar nummers soms bijstaan door enkele overigens uitstekende muzikanten roland van campenhout op gitaar b v of kristof steenhaut op accordeon frans ieven op bas en mark godefroit op trombone het uitgangspunt blijft immers dat ik de nummers in een soloprogramma moet kunnen vertolken ik begin niet meer met een band dat is gedaan daar ben ik een beetje van verzadigd vandaar ook dat ik expliciet zou willen vragen om het woord carri re tussen aanhalingstekens te plaatsen ik doe immers alleen iets wat ik graag doe anders interesseert het me niet
155997 ik speel ook altijd op een akoestische piano als de organisatoren geen goede piano beschikbaar hebben dan kunnen ze zich wenden tot een firma uit dendermonde waarmee ik reeds sedert de tijd van jeggpap samenwerk die verhuren dan een seiler piano ik heb het nogal voor duitse pianos omdat die meer warmte hebben dan de japanese een elektrische piano komt hoegenaamd niet in aanmerking dat is speelgoed ik heb er wel zelf n staan maar dat is om dingen uit te proberen met de koptelefoon op
155998 mijn muziek is nachtmuziek maar dat wil daarom niet zeggen dat ik een nachtraaf ben ik denk trouwens ook niet dat een tom waits of zo echt z leeft als men ons wil doen geloven daarvoor is hun conditie veel te goed en daarbij op mijn leeftijd is het niet meer nodig om lang uit te zitten om dat patina op je stem te krijgen eens je de vijftig bent gepasseerd h ft je stem patina dat geldt ook voor het inhoudelijke als je twintig bent zing je dat soort nummers niet h

156096 anything that might harm chinas reputation as a security threat
156097 that extends to any group seeking to push an agenda that is not aligned with the governments propaganda
156098 western anti china forces are striving for opportunities to disrupt the games
156099 international terrorist forces are itching to strike and hostile domestic forcess disruption and sabotage activities against the games are steadily unfolding
156100 there will definitely be an expectations gap between what the chinese government is planning and what international participants expect
156101 there are very different norms in terms of personal freedoms
156102 target the most critical points related to the olympics using tactics that have never been employed
156103 is the preeminent threat to the olympics but because of the security measures it would be very difficult for them to attack olympic venues
156104 they have inflated and distorted terrorist claims in order to justify a broader repressive campaign in xinjiang
156105 it is possible that xinjiang based etim extremists may contemplate conducting attacks to disrupt the games
156106 for those who intend to sabotage the games the most important way to control them lies in our people
156107 the police will be very proactive in stopping any protests before they gain momentum though western activist groups will likely try to stage small demonstrations these will most likely be put down as quickly and peacefully as possible

156109 ze voelen op dit moment ook geen enkele druk vermoedelijk zullen ze pas echt overwegen of ze vertrekken of niet als hen gezegd wordt dat de politie op komst is ondertussen eisen ze nog steeds hun regularisatie ook al is hen duidelijk uitgelegd dat ze op weinig moeten hopen
156110 ik heb vernomen dat het stadsbestuur in de loop van de dag opnieuw met de politie zou vergaderen over de toestand
156111 er is op dit moment geen ontruimingsbevel en er is ook geen hoogdringendheid omdat er hier nog niet gewerkt wordt vanaf maandag zullen de werken hernomen worden dus ik vermoed dat ze tegen dan wel zullen moeten vertrekken voorlopig is het evenwel afwachten wat het stadsbestuur beslist

156122 if he anwar is qualified to contest he will contest no matter what
156123 both the sodomy case and the by election have their own due process the sodomy case against anwar is still ongoing and when the time comes it will be for the police and the chambers to decide if there is a case
156124 due process has never been halted merely because the person involved wants to contest or is appointed to a post
156125 if it is his intention to use the by election as a cover for his ongoing sodomy case he cannot run or ride from it he knows all this
156126 but in the end his choice is permatang pauh maybe its easier for the wife to give way to him if he were to contest in other areas the pkr mp may not be that likely to give way

156131 request but just couldnt pass this up because it reminded you so much of their child on the other hand those of us with kids older than age 3 have undoubtedly been the recipients of gifts that were bought just to have something to give and thats annoying id rather just enjoy having a child at the party and see how happy my child is with his presence than know that the parent ran out to buy something that isnt something my kids really going to like not only did it add some stress to the parents life to have to buy something but my child probably wont really enjoy it or wont enjoy it for long if you wouldnt want it in your house which rules out most bleepy toys bratz and anything that makes a noise when you sit on it then dont give it to someone else gifts please

156157 you can expect a little bit of nervousness and slightly low volume until we see the figures
156158 it is going to be a weak figure sso long as its not going to be dreadful then its kind of confirmation of the difficult
156159 whenever we play at the same time as an arsenal game nobody shows up
156160 i like man utd because theyre winners actually i like any club that wins in europe nigerians like winners were simple people nigerian clubs can you really compare theyre rubbish i dont waste my time with that
156161 when you look at the stadiums youll find that the stands are virtually empty while the bars and the joints that have satellite tv are full people will pay to watch the premier league on tv but not to watch nigerian football live
156162 in the 1980s i was the only person in my area who was watching english football
156163 when a player wont even be paid 1 000 2 000 per month in nigeria but can get 1 000 a week in europe what do you expect
156164 young people are inspired by the premier league it spurs them on to play and the money the teams get when they move to europe is good for the clubs
156165 the second governor told his team to lose by four goals
156166 its part of globalisation football is not immune to that
156167 you can see im an arsenal fan by the hat on my head

156173 mais tu sais mamie je vais te dire un grand secret je tadore
156174 we created the farm rich block party program to encourage and reward families and friends joining forces to better their communities
156175 their levels of operation is limited by inadequate finances and inability to procure required farm input and high crop yield varieties thus finding it difficult to come out of poverty
156176 we need result oriented agricultural policies that would enhance food sufficiency and food security in the country most importantly how can we make agriculture very attractive to all and sundry especially our teeming youths we should in this forum harmonize all projects concerning food security and poverty reduction with a view to improving the standard of living of our people
156177 we need to examine the issues that led to de industrialization of the north whereby many of the northern industries have been closed with attendant consequences for the social security of our people
156178 we need to be very clear on why the two tractor assembly plants located at kano tractor and bauchi styre tractors are today shut down or why most of our textile factories are out of business our fertilizer plants are producing below installed capacity while some have closed thereby making the commodity to be very expensive we must continue to find answers to these in knowing what went wrong
156179 there is serious poverty in the north and in the country we can see poverty everywhere food insecurity has more devastating effect on governance the fact that today the nation imports food is a disgrace to the north
156180 we should pay more attention to farmers we must do more than what we are doing now not only in the provision of inputs but also in ensuring good output that would bring profit to the farmer and enhanced his economic empowerment
156181 but i think they were excited to play in the pit again and they all got along really well
156182 it was interesting to see how the hobbs and clovis players were going to get along but they really got along well and it was neat to watch
156183 it was special that was probably the most special thing for me to coach those guys one more time in the pit and they all did a good job
156184 it was really special for me to do that and even more so with jaden
156185 it was a good week and a good way for us to go out
156186 like i told them we got the one in here that really mattered
156187 then we had the ball three possessions and couldnt score
156188 then we lost a guy on transition defense they got a basket and then got a steal and another basket
156189 it was kind of a hard deal because everyone that was out there was kind of a playmaker on their own team
156190 they all wanted to be one and there were spots in there when we needed a passer instead
156191 the decision on his release will be read before him that day it will be signed by the director of the prison

156193 from the squads of 12 shooters only three will be using real bullets
156194 we are in the worst trading environment the industry has ever faced
156195 the combination of unprecedented oil prices economic slowdown and weaker consumer confidence has led to substantially lower first quarter profits
156196 we expect our fuel bill to top three billion pounds this year the equivalent of more than eight million pounds every day
156197 since year end we have adapted our plans to reflect the fast moving and challenging conditions we have reduced capacity in the winter schedule without compromising our network and at the same time we have the flexibility in the business to capitalise when conditions improve
156198 we have revised our capital expenditure plans and are focusing on cost control
156199 its important to carry out a new strategy to seek economic growth
156200 as a cabinet we are not working just for the sake of approval ratings
156201 what voters want isnt a change of ministers but a change to policies that will safeguard peoples lives
156202 we are determined to change the government in upcoming elections
156203 this conveys the message that fukuda will stay in his job and try to win public support

156238 i cant believe that everything boiled down to one bad day but im so happy for him after all the frustrations and injuries hes had throughout the years its such a wonderful thing im so happy for him but for that one lousy day that one crash and he would have been there on the podium
156239 because i hated hills i absolutely hated hills so ive no idea how he became a climber
156240 i was with him almost every day before the time trial today and when cancellaras time came up c and i were alone and he says its a good time but it can be beat i said thats really really a good attitude which is the attitude that hes kept all through the tour
156241 and i think what im most proud of him for is his change of mental attitude from being a domestique to being a leader thats huge its like being a pulling guard in football to being a quarterback its a total change of thought process
156242 i think jonathan i think jonathan vaughters did it and then team physiologist allun lim and the whole garmin chipotle team i was talking to directeur sportif matt white and the whole team put this together you can do this you can do this you can do this
156243 i think the first time trial said im here and when he tried to breakaway on that first mountain stage to super besse he called me that night and says dad i wasnt there i wasnt hurting and after that first time trial he says i wasnt even close i couldnt push myself today he pushed himself he was very impressive very brave
156244 and im looking at people who are really shattered at doping control
156245 and thats the thing with cycling its not like football theres no bench thats the cruelty of cycling
156246 it was extremely fast and everybody fears that you know including myself as a bike rider when you have a bad moment on a day like that theres no please exchange me for five minutes i need a breather you just have to hang in there whatever it takes
156247 oh for sure you absolutely can i mean thats a completely false mindset
156248 thats one of the big reasons i did come to this team to get that validation putting your arm out for blood tests is just part of the deal now i dont even think about it
156249 even my mom said he looked too easy and fast so if your mother is watching the racing and says it doesnt look as if he was hurting enough for what he did thats a pretty logical assessment is it surprising its surprising that theyre still doing that and cheating that way its mind blowing but its a question of taking those risks its proven theyll get caught and thats important im glad theyre no longer in the race thats a good thing
156250 they will see if things are wrong i like someone looking out for my wellbeing its beneficial at this level its a very demanding thing on the body
156251 ive spent a good portion of my past 20 years enraged by dopers and seized every opportunity to expose them no apologies they deserve our contempt but not as much as the guys who are trying to compete clean deserve our support id lost sight of that to david millar christian vande velde ryder hesjedal will frischkorn danny pate julian dean martin maaskant trent lowe and magnus b ckstedt thanks for the reminder
156252 the sport has a hell of a lot to do before it drags itself from the mire but with guys like vaughters it has a chance i hope vande velde comes back and wins the tour next year and i hope that every tour i watch from now is as much fun as this one was i hope
156253 that so many of the riders and staff had been at u s postal a notorious doping team was a concern
156254 i think we all have a responsibility to change the image of the sport
156255 unfortunately theres still some people that want to see it go away want to tear it down im not one of those people i want to be part of the renovation my story is what it is and i try my best on the bike and hopefully it is good for the sport i hope so but at the same time i think the courage and the hard work of the other riders is also good for the sport its not a crooked sport its a healthy sport its a good sport its a wonderful traditional sport
156256 if you think that cycling functions like that you are mistaken and it would be better if you went home
156257 we have nothing to hide if anything we shouldnt be talking of all the planning we did for this tour we should be hiding that because if people copy our system then we wouldnt have an advantage
156258 music theatre and film may provide much the same experience as watching sports but in sport there is no script that in the end is why people watch sport and will keep on doing so they want escape excitement and suspense the french still turned out to cheer the peloton in july americas ballparks are full and next week hundreds of millions will be watching the olympics

156287 this beautiful thing we just did was our way to talk to you about supporting the church financially
156288 if this is your first time visiting i promise we dont always talk about money
156289 money is a weird subject to hear about in a church on a sunday i agree im a little sweaty too just saying money and church in the same sentence but when you look at the bible it doesnt treat money as a weird subject from the detailed beauty of the resources used to create the temple to the dangers that hide in the weeds like lions when we have too much the bible doesnt whimper quietly when it comes to money and so i dont want to either i dont want to pretend that one sermon a year is enough to equip you for the more than 5 000 marketing messages you see every day asking you for money telling you how to use it and get more of it and worship it this isnt going to be about tithing this going to be about truth because i think when we engage with the truth well find that tithing isnt simply something we have to do its something well want to do

156315 from foreigners point of view it might seem like a slowdown in reform but fukuda sees it as steady reform
156316 i see this as a cabinet reshuffle to show that fukuda wants to call a general election under his leadership
156317 i think an election is highly likely around the end of year to the beginning of next year but its possible that itll be earlier than that thats what we will be calling for
156318 it sends a signal that the ldp is not coming up with fresh new ideas that i think is going to be a losing strategy i mean he is a throw back to old style politics

156364 after taking a few different exams and mris the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder
156365 there are so many mixed feelings because on wednesday night they were almost positive there was something wrong with my nerve which could have ultimately been much more serious
156366 but after thursday mornings tests for the first time in a while they were able to give me a different answer and a different problem
156367 this is something that needs a lot of time to heal it really hurts me to say i have to miss the olympics

156427 4 billion each year to the oil companies including 1 2 billion for exxon mobil alone
156428 pad oil company profits and save you at best half a tank of gas
156429 increases the risk that unscrupulous employees will use funds for unintended purposes
156430 there now appears to be a degree of durability in gains
156431 mass movements of people who demanded that america live up to its own democratic rhetoric
156432 basically an introduction to neuroeconomics they cite the first success of neuroeconomics as providing support for the idea that irrational behaviour in a one shot ultimatum game is explained by a punishment motive
156433 the neuroscientists idea of a game is rock paper scissors which is zero sum whereas economists have focused on strategic games that produce gains through collaboration
156434 it is far easier to argue for mindless economics than for brainless economics
156435 not every pizza delivery company would be confident providing a behind the scenes snapshot of how its products are made
156436 we thought that is was about time that we shouted about our commitment to quality a little louder
156437 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
156438 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
156439 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
156440 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
156441 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
156442 this years crop of peanuts has been in the ground for weeks and 2008 production contracts were signed months ago changing the loan differential formula after the peanut crop has been planted would have been detrimental for our growers domestic demand for peanuts and peanut products has increased and the federal government should allow growers to respond to this demand without interrupting current systems in place i applaud usda for recognizing the importance of maintaining the historically recognized practice of establishing loan differentials for the 2008 crop year
156443 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
156444 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
156445 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
156446 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
156447 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
156448 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
156449 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
156450 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
156451 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
156452 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
156453 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
156454 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
156455 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
156456 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
156457 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
156458 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
156459 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
156460 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
156461 ralph engelstad arena learned a tremendous amount from the 2005 event and were ready to apply these lessons learned in 2011
156462 our bid will be different from others in that we have successfully hosted the event before made a significant financial guarantee to usa hockey as well as provided financial opportunities for charitable hockey organizations in grand forks east grand forks moorhead and the state of north dakota
156463 we obtained approval to begin construction of our coal and biomass plant in southwest virginia
156464 despite economic headwinds revenues were up in all regions even after excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates
156465 the global diversity of our operations our investments in technology and value added services and successful execution of our cost reduction efforts
156466 the animal was having great difficulty in righting itself and water was starting to lap around the blow hole
156467 a decision was taken to put the animal to sleep on welfare grounds
156468 as they made their way to the animal it did manage to right itself and it is now free swimming but in fairly shallow water so right now the prognosis is not good
156469 when an animal restrands for a second time it is often very poorly by that stage
156470 if it hasnt fed it hasnt drank as it gets its water from its food so we are going to have a very frightened distressed animal on our hands
156471 if this animal does strand again the only humane cause of action will be
156472 hes here to add competition for places and put pressure on our other keepers
156473 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
156474 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
156475 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
156476 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
156477 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
156478 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
156479 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
156480 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
156481 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
156482 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
156483 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
156484 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
156485 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
156486 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
156487 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
156488 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
156489 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
156490 when high profile corporations merge the innocent are often caught in the crossfire
156491 id software is no longer planning to create a new next generation quake arena game after the launch of quake live
156492 we did decide for a lot of reasons that we wanted to just push hard for doing doom internally
156493 primarily because its fun but also to show artists we like and give a few young ones the chance to show without commercial restrictions
156494 i didnt know at the time if i was making the right decision
156495 but once i had been in the water five minutes i looked at that boat and i knew i did the right thing
156496 you could feel the fire on the back of your legs
156497 ill never quit thinking about it i lost a boat
156498 all the people when they started getting to where they could see land they were like a kid going to the fair
156499 shes an awesome little boat shes built like a tank
156500 if the hull is still intact thats my battleship id love to have it back
156501 we got all the passengers and all the crew home safely
156502 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
156503 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
156504 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
156505 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
156506 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
156507 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
156508 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
156509 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
156510 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
156511 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
156512 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
156513 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
156514 who are open to doing something on the production side
156515 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
156516 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
156517 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
156518 we are overjoyed by this decision we have waited 30 years for our sea rights to be legally recognised
156519 a negotiated outcome will mean traditional owners around the northern territorys coastline can jointly participate in the management and development of a sustainable fishing industry
156520 traditional owners have developed a constructive relationship with commercial and recreational fishing representatives over the past year
156521 the freedoms territorians enjoy have been challenged by this decision
156522 we are going to have to arrange some sort of settlement with indigenous interests
156523 inizia un viaggio inizia una nuova vita non importa dove vivi non importa dove sei diretto lunica cosa che conta del tuo viaggio il viaggio stesso la strada che percorrerai prima di partire per devi capire chi sei veramente prova a guardarti allo specchio non fermarti allapparenza vai oltre guarda pi a fondo che cosa scorre dentro di te sangue o veleno
156524 today i am exercising my executive authority to avoid a full blown crisis and keep our state moving forward
156525 this is not an action i take lightly but we do not have a budget and as governor i have a responsibility to make sure our state has enough money to pay its bills
156526 people are going to get put out of their homes the governor says hes sorry we cant pay with sorry
156527 if thats what it takes im here to make sure that our state functions and whatever it takes i will do it
156528 the animal was having great difficulty in righting itself and water was starting to lap around the blow hole
156529 a decision was taken to put the animal to sleep on welfare grounds
156530 as they made their way to the animal it did manage to right itself and it is now free swimming but in fairly shallow water so right now the prognosis is not good
156531 our primary concern is that they do the biological opinion right rather than fast
156532 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
156533 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
156534 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
156535 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
156536 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
156537 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
156538 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
156539 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
156540 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
156541 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
156542 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
156543 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
156544 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
156545 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
156546 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
156547 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
156548 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
156549 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
156550 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
156551 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
156552 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
156553 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
156554 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
156555 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
156556 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
156557 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
156558 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
156559 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
156560 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
156561 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
156562 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
156563 open source database checklist 5 key attributes for the enterprise
156564 i find it particularly interesting that fish are capable of such a sophisticated behavior
156565 the study highlights that traits that we typically ascribe to humans only can also be found in other seemingly simpler animals and that no consciousness or self awareness is needed for a behavior like deception to occur
156566 future studies will need to evaluate the potential for male mate choice copying and deception in natural populations because male mate choice copying cannot be evolutionarily stable if males always have an opportunity to deceive rivals
156567 foi tudo muito r pido ele n o esperava por isso

156578 maar het systeem daar werkt prijsopdrijvend de hoogste bieder mag er staan daarom moest ik 3 50 euro als ritprijs vragen dat vind ik eigenlijk te veel als gezinnetje ben je dan gauw klaar
156579 hier gaat het op inschrijving zonder dat exploitanten van elkaar weten wat hun pachtsom is in eindhoven kijken ze niet alleen naar het geld maar ook naar de kwaliteit van de attractie en het bedrijf daarachter

156586 down these mean streets a man must come a hero born murdered and born again when a rookie cop named denny colt returns from the beyond as the spirit a hero whose mission is to fight against the bad forces from the shadows of central city the octopus who kills anyone unfortunate enough to see his face who has other plans hes going to wipe out the entire city the spirit tracks this cold hearted killer from the citys rundown warehouses to the damp catacombs to the windswept waterfront all the while facing a bevy of beautiful women who either want to seduce love or kill the masked crusader
156587 rika what brings you here christmas is always spent with yossie isnt it

156589 she said the next time when she says i love you she wants to mean every single word of that phrase
156590 i feel kind of free now as though ive broken free of the chains that imprisoned me but people always say that love that can stand the 7 years test will last forever so im disappointed that we cant pass the test even though ive tried my best

156672 a day after gubernatorial candidates roundly criticized prison health care charlie copeland the republican candidate for lieutenant governor weighed in thursday with his disapproval of the condition of state prisons and called for reforms in the wake of a recently released report
156673 copeland pointed to efforts he championed in the senate to remove mandatory sentencing for convicted criminals and work with the coalition for prison reform and justice he said many of his efforts were thwarted by the democratic majority in the senate and gov ruth ann minner
156674 denn said copeland had ample opportunity to work toward solving the problems with prisons while he was in the senate but had not done so
156675 time to get a move on time to get back on the road

156694 o n mero de mortos no regime militar foi muito maior do que no brasil calcula se que foram mais de 13 mil mortes na argentina enquanto no brasil foram mais de 400 a press o em cima do governo por parte das fam lias diferente
156695 mas em casos dos outros pa ses da am rica latina eles encontraram formas de driblar a lei de torn la mais flex vel s puni es a lei da anistia n o intoc vel como se mostra aqui

156697 o brasil um exemplo de democracia na am rica latina mas ainda n o conseguiu fechar as portas do passado enquanto n o resolver a quest o dos arquivos sempre vai ter um debate sobre esse per odo a dor daquela poca n o vai acabar
156698 o governo brasileiro tem que abrir os arquivos e n o s pelo brasil o pa s teve muita influ ncia na regi o participou da opera o condor e precisamos ter acesso aos documentos secretos para conhecer mais de outros regimes

156715 president bush expressed concern that certain elements in the isi were leaking information to the terrorists before they could be hit by the u s or pakistani forces this is a cause of concern for the u s side
156716 i love stockings and suspenders i think they are ultra feminine and look really sexy
156717 any woman wearing them will instantly be feeling more sexual and powerful which is a good thing im sure guys will like them too
156718 i think men are off the agenda for a while

156721 potential application of cannabinoids as anti tumor drugs is an exciting prospect because cannabinoid agonists are being evaluated now to treat the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy
156722 turning cb1 back on and then treating with a cannabinoid agonist could provide a new approach to colorectal cancer treatment or prevention
156723 i am deeply grieved to learn of the sad demise of harkishan singh surjeet he will always be remembered by the countrymen as a statesman and a very good human being may his soul rest in peace i join the nation in paying tribute to the departed soul

156737 estamos ansiosos por competir en este torneo tan prestigioso y con este nivel en el que nos enfrentaremos a equipos muy grandes
156738 va a ser un partido bonito de ver entre dos equipos fuertes ambos entrenadores somos conscientes de que es un duelo importante pero lo que prima es el estado f sico estamos aqu para prepararnos de cara a nuestros respectivos campeonatos y aunque queremos hacer un buen papel lo primordial es coger ritmo para estar al cien por cien de cara a la liga

156741 participamos en un torneo atractivo por la presencia de equipos del nivel del sevilla el chelsea y el milan tengo que agradecer tambi n al lokomotiv las atenciones que estamos recibiendo desde que hemos llegado a mosc y esperemos disfrutar de un magn fico espect culo
156742 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
156743 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
156744 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
156745 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
156746 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
156747 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
156748 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
156749 he told the police he had nothing to do with this
156750 ive found the impact test to be a very useful tool
156751 the test measures memory reaction time concentration and things like that
156752 football is the number one reason we see concussions followed by soccer
156753 but head injuries occur in all sports both mens and womens
156754 one thing about concussions is that many symptoms are subjective
156755 if you have objective data through the impact test that can help us better measure an athletes recovery
156756 you try to prevent injuries as much as you can but unfortunately its part of the game
156757 this test has turned out to be a really valuable tool it takes a lot of the guesswork out of it for the medical staff
156758 some kids are afraid theyre not going to be able to play if they report an injury but the reality is that this is one injury you dont mess with
156759 consistent with this states strong policy against any form of discrimination in the workplace we hold that the threshold for demonstrating a religion based discriminatory hostile work environment cannot be any higher or more stringent than the threshold that applies to sexually or racially hostile workplace environment claims
156760 theres many ways to be funny you dont have to use slurs
156761 he never believed his job was in jeopardy because he was jewish he never believed he would not be promoted because he was jewish
156762 employees now have to be on guard they cant even joke about ethnic matters in the workplace
156763 this decision does not mean the end of humor in the workplace but it should make people rethink the type of humor that is being used people tend to be dismissive when someone elses race religion or sexual orientation is being mocked
156764 its flapping its tail and moving its head so its still with us its a case of waiting until the tide rises to hopefully get it back into the water
156765 as the tide comes in it lifts the whole contraption up which gives us control of the whale
156766 it has been in the area for a couple of days which is not good it means it will be already dehydrated and very very hungry
156767 its a northern bottlenose whale like the one in the thames so it wont have eaten for a couple of days because theres no squid and it feeds on squid in the deep water
156768 its very very unusual we have had seals before but never a whale
156769 there was an audible gasp it was fantastic news there were a couple of lads who slapped each other on the back they smiled and grinned at each other and there was a lot of disbelief
156770 the charges faced by the defendants have not been proven to the required degree all defendants are acquitted i find them innocent
156771 on one hand its very very tough for us but on the other it is very exciting
156772 i think of all the teams we could have had that is the toughest or one of the toughest obviously we looked at arsenal liverpool juventus schalke and we got one of the most difficult
156773 in one respect its a tough draw for us on the other its now an opponent we know very well not just myself everyone in holland knows the premier league well so arsenal will be no strangers to us
156774 this is a reward for a great achievement last season in reaching this stage to get one of the big teams
156775 it will be a once in a lifetime experience that doesnt come along that often im sure the fans will be delighted
156776 we are pleased with the draw logistically holland isnt too far and it will give our fans the opportunity to see the game
156777 as you rightly say its a reunion with steve and we are looking forward to it
156778 when steve was first team coach for the national team and then manager they used to use our training ground at london colney so there are good relations there
156779 im assuming people will say arsenal are one of the strongest seeded teams and he might have been hoping for someone else but thats what the draw brought us and we get on with it
156780 yesterday i got pole but i didnt get the perfect lap together today i did two laps good enough for pole
156781 were on pole by quite a big margin which is fantastic around such a difficult circuit its a real drivers track and i just love it out there hopefully we can convert the poles into wins
156782 spa is very high speed very fast and flowing and i think that suits my driving style quite well
156783 it was a bit unfortunate that there was a yellow flag at the end because i could have gone a little quicker although it wouldnt have been enough to catch turvey hes very quick around here
156784 the negative sentiment expressed in a huge range of economic indicators is now feeding through to the real economy with businesses that a year ago had been able to paper over the cracks now being fully exposed
156785 individuals are being drawn into debt management schemes which are not reported in these figures and have altered the overall picture of indebtedness
156786 debt management schemes do not effectively deal with personal insolvency problems and the process can prolong the issue with individuals still forced into bankruptcy at a later date
156787 its only a matter of time before personal insolvencies pick up
156788 the outlook for employment is key and i would expect a sharp rise towards the end of the year
156789 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
156790 played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
156791 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
156792 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
156793 he parado tres a os porque sab a que hac a falta
156794 creo que los estudios me ayudar n a tener una perspectiva m s amplia
156795 en el caso de las candidatas la presencia del jefe de estado en la apertura de unos juegos es imprescindible porque establecer contactos es importante para la elecci n
156796 no effective biological controls that are feasible in natural areas are known
156797 shall be forever a sovereign democratic and independent state founded upon the principles of liberty and justice and ever seeking the welfare and happiness of its people
156798 we the citizens of singapore pledge ourselves as one united people regardless of race language or religion to build a democratic society based on justice and equality so as to achieve happiness prosperity amp progress for our nation
156799 with the first round of the governments economic stimulus checks having been mailed in early may one would have hoped they would have bolstered online spending in may and june
156800 however recent comscore research reveals that fully two thirds of consumers said they had not planned to spend their stimulus checks and rather intended to use the cash to pay off debt or put the money into savings i ts likely the impact of the stimulus may have been felt more offline where a variety of merchants made it particularly easy for consumers to cash their checks at retail stores
156801 at the time we started it no one else was doing it
156802 there wasnt a lot of reliable information out there about the flu
156803 we thought the contributions ought to be put together by everyone because something as wide ranging as a pandemic involves more than just the health department
156804 if you have to close the schools down in a pandemic parents have to know where to pick up their kids they need to know where they can get food and electricity it goes well beyond the virus itself
156805 one of the things we have accomplished is pushing governmental entities to be more transparent
156806 im not sure there would have even been a pandemicflu gov if it hadnt been for our site
156807 this is the wisdom of crowds everyone gets a chance to look at it if theres false information it needs to be corrected
156808 it was started to share information between associates in cardiology
156809 i didnt intend it to be shared throughout the world but it took on a life of its own
156810 its something that has potential to provide up to date medical information
156811 i have a wall of textbooks but sometimes you need more current information a textbook costs us 300 and by the time it comes out its out of date
156812 medicine has lagged behind other professions in its use of technology
156813 whatever we can do to make things more efficient we should do
156814 i wanted to use the power of a wiki for surgical knowledge
156815 doctors need an online resource that they can access at any time in a hospital in the old days they would rely on books but these get out of date and pages go missing so a wiki provides a great opportunity to close that information gap
156816 they have to submit a cv curriculum vitae of their credentials be approved by the site editors and also confirm their e mail address when an article is posted it can be approved by an editor and this status is shown
156817 this is a great news source which i look forward to reading every day
156818 any attempts to delay the by election which must be held within 60 days after the election commission is notified or to arrest him or charge him in court will be seen by his supporters as a form of victimisation
156819 also he is already scheduled to address the people in permatang pauh this saturday its a well thought plan to pre empt bns efforts to derail his political agenda
156820 im not surprised if anwar can increase the number for the constituents they know they are going to vote for a prime minister
156821 it will even be better than the recent general election we have received news that the local pas leaders will begin to mobilise their election machinery to help us even dap members are excited about this
156822 the meeting will also determine the dates to issue the writ and notices to pave the way for the by election as well as to decide on which electoral roll to be used
156823 this is a place that would afford him the best chance to win so we will leave it to the permatang pauh voters to decide we will try our best
156824 the allegation against him was made by his own staff not the government
156825 but we accept his decision and we will face it anything can happen in a by election
156826 the government also gives an assurance that the retail price of petrol will not exceed rm2 70 a litre this year
156827 i am confident that when we do move the motion we will have the numbers you see the reason why they are making all these accusations against me is precisely because they know their days are numbered
156828 we have the numbers we have the support they want to stop me before we throw them out
156829 instead of addressing pressing economic problems like soaring inflation the government is trying to divert public attention with this filthy sodomy charade
156830 our ministers waste their time in political intrigue instead of trying to help make the country more competitive
156831 i am innocent and i am confident that i will clear my name
156832 pas leaders have assured me that they have no desire of leaving the pakatan and joining the barisan or merging with umno
156833 they have kept me informed of their meetings with umno
156834 this garden is therapy peace work but work is good i love to work
156835 the urge and desire to know about plants was like the urge to eat ice cream i think i was born this way
156836 i was smoking pot like cigarettes it was the thing that had me by the throat
156837 perennials have more design and texture to them though not necessarily color unless you have a variety
156838 i like people to see this as a working garden
156839 i give all credit to my personal savior jesus christ
156840 the more im around people the more i love my garden
156841 plants dont play mind games plants arent cruel plants dont kill each other or commit crimes
156842 mengapa tidak dengan umno mereka pun hampir setiap hari melambai lambai tangan agar pas bersama mereka
156843 the paradoxical thing is that while the caribbean takes the impact of the large drug flows the international cooperation has descended significantly in the last few years
156844 one of the most pernicious writers is steven plaut a man who could be thought of as israels daniel pipes
156845 the inclusion of automatic integration between isynergy and other enterprise applications allows our customers to simply and easily innovate how they distribute and manage content between applications
156846 the ilink integration can be completed without additional code or modifications to the existing application dramatically easing the burden across the enterprise in the development of customized links between isynergy content management and other applications
156847 forgive me for being cynical but i dont believe mobileme is working properly for one second thank god i wasnt one of the 1 did apple get the enron accountants to come up with that figure who got totally screwed on email but i have had all the other woes people have reported over the past few weeks
156848 it simply stopped delivering about 50 of my messages for about two hours theyve never turned up today after the damn thing is supposed to be working i had a 30 minute period a few hours ago where mail kept demanding my password and wouldnt sign in to my imap internet message access protocol account
156849 mobileme has been working perfectly fine for me for the past week or more
156850 syncing between home the mobileme cloud and my work machine is dead
156851 i keep getting inconsistent data despite continually resetting removing restarting mobile me and sync over a number of days im hoping for a second free month from apple for this
156852 every type of publicity has some effect so how big a deal it is its not the end of the universe but its not helpful
156853 in terms of it being expected what you have to look at is apple has a larger and larger footprint in the market and many of its customers are new to computers and as it acquires more consumers its getting the less sophisticated types who dont know the things like on the first day of the service there will be lots of calls and the servers will be overtaxed sophisticated users will tend to know this but the newbies will complain and thatll create bad press
156854 this is the first stumble that apple has made in a pretty long while
156855 i feel that since coo tim cook arrived apple has been executing uncommonly well it could be that apple is seeing some of the limits of growth
156856 as long as nvidia manages good operations and improves in these areas theyve got a stunning range of products for many industries gaming gpus graphic processing units chipsets for pc and mac open gl has always been their strength so open gl or maybe open gl es plays to their advantage were talking physics physx which will probably be integrated into open cl cuda etc
156857 in the desktop portable and even mobile space nvidia has a lot to offer apple as long as quality control is maintained
156858 i dont know much about it but isnt that the point of android that its open source if they want an open source cell phone why dont they just use that
156859 oh right they think they are entitled to apples hardware
156860 weve been hearing so much talk about the proliferation of national chains in new york and how mom and pop stores have been pushed out of the city but it struck me that there was so little data

156872 this is a really exciting initiative which we are fully supporting
156873 this project offers an incentive for young people to wear cycle helmets and to begin thinking and learning about road safety from a young age

156915 the best way to bring downward pressure on prices is by bringing on new supply while doing everything we can to use energy efficiently
156916 whats shocking is that big oil is plowing these profits into stock buybacks instead of increasing production or investing in alternative energy

156937 i am no one special just a common man with common thoughts ive led a common life there are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten but in one respect ive succeeded as gloriously as anyone who ever lived ive loved another with all my heart and soul and for me that has always been enough
156938 i guess i could be pretty pissed off about what happened to me but its hard to stay mad when theres so much beauty in the world sometimes i feel like im seeing it all at once and its too much my heart fills up like a balloon thats about to burst and then i remember to relax and stop trying to hold on to it and then if flows through me like rain and i cant feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life you have no idea what im talking about im sure but dont worry you will someday

156941 affinity rewards is a program that encourages corporations to bond over recreational activities
156942 while there is obviously plenty of opportunity for meetings and conferences affinity rewards is meant to bring winter sports to the table or the meeting table to winter sports

156946 the residents are outraged that the city is ignoring their plea to keep fire department ems and instead is proceeding with this plan
156947 if i have a problem the day after the change is made i still call 911 or the police desk
156948 my wife works but theres going to have to be a lot of cutbacks in the household
156949 theyre still on alert because we have another big wind event coming in tomorrow
156950 the fire has burned to the point now where people can see the flames
156951 its still flaming up there but theyve been on it day and night
156952 i kept hoping for the best so hearing its gone just kind of took the wind out of me
156953 it staggers the brain to think about how much devastation a fire can have how many people this affects
156954 typically we dont see wildland fires of this magnitude until much later in the season
156955 but with the dry fuel conditions that we have throughout the state we could see similar situations arise again until we get a significant amount of rain
156956 we discussed the matter in closed session on monday giving legal advice to the city council
156957 we filed notice of appeal about two months ago and we are proceeding with the appeal
156958 they said he waited too long a period between 1990 and 2005
156959 its a complicated issue thats why we offered to settle
156960 we dont want to do anything to jeopardize the investigation
156961 unfortunately the situation has caught up with us now where once again they are obliged to go back on the international market to buy gas for the forthcoming period
156962 the gas prices have gone through the roof and we have had to pay very much more for our gas supplies
156963 although we have done our best to keep the tariffs down as low as we possibly can and there is already a substantial element of subsidy in the electricity price it has not been possible to absorb these huge increases
156964 we maintained our profit margins this quarter at 39 per cent in the face of cost and price pressures our financial position and strong liquidity along with our ability to control costs have placed us in a firm position
156965 the group has been growing between 40 per cent and 45 per cent since the last nine years and the performance during the quarter was in line with that
156966 snob value for the address was something that went with high prices rather than any other feature of the south mumbai premium home
156967 the benchmark if one wants to quantify the highest price level as being one has consistently risen with the last on record transaction being the one where movie star and bjp mp vinod khanna bought a residential apartment at malabar hill in the tony south mumbai area from citibank for rs 1 25 lakh a sq ft
156968 this followed a similar transaction some months back when a london based nri acquired a 3475 sq ft property in ncpa apartments at nariman point for rs 97 842 per sq ft
156969 a premium home to be so truly has to have more than just a high price and posh address
156970 it has to give the residents a lifestyle that complements the status of living in a premium address
156971 it does not make a project less premium if the address is lower parel nor does a project not truly premium become it is in worli
156972 there is no substitute for a well planned home constructed with the best of construction technology having the latest in luxurious amenities but a truly premium south mumbai home needs to also provide open spaces for the children sufficient car parking a safe and secure environment premium is what a buyer wants and gets in a south mumbai home just as he would have in any global city
156973 a premium home in south mumbai would need something more than just posh locations
156974 i can think of two projects by the orbit group villa orb and orbit arya which fit in this segment both are located at napean sea road and the amenities and features are mind blowing
156975 from a time when hiranandani gardens created a shift in premium residential locations from just being in tony locations in south mumbai to central suburbia the message has gone home and developers are coming up with these new homes that are spacious have the latest amenities and have vast open spaces
156976 in mumbai s high end residential property context the definition of luxu ry is changing at a pace beyond contemplation
156977 some developers say they are creating a limited edition project some brand their project super luxurious and some say out right not for all by invitation only also location is not the only deciding factor it is coupled with a host of parameters ranging from size duplexes glass exteriors bath room fittings designer kitchens amenities like clubhouse swimming pools gardens and open spaces conference and business centers ample parking with car elevators library and the list seems to be ever evolving security concerns itself have risen way above just a uniformed watchman cctv cameras video door phones coupled with fingerprint and swipe card access with hi tech alarm systems have become a must for south mumbai s premium residential properties
156978 a project is truly premium if it has exclusivity and uniqueness it has to exude quality in every aspect the entire feel should be such that the buyer gets the feeling of being treated like a king and not like a regular person this for realty here is a totally new paradigm
156979 skippers are putting on foresails while steaming to fishing grounds offshore
156980 the whole cost structure of the industry has shifted so dramatically as a result of fuel price rises and in response vessels are looking at what they can do to reduce costs
156981 fleets are going to have to find ways of reducing fuel dependency everyone is looking for the optimum steaming speed and people are looking at a whole range of measures including sail
156982 fisherman returning to use of sails as fuel costs rise
156983 sometimes it looks like its a foggy day but the air quality is actually good

156996 we hope that foreign reporters while in china will respect our laws and rules report objectively and help communication and understanding between china and the peoples of the world
156997 the determining factor in securing the success of the olympic games is to work vigorously to promote the olympic spirit featuring friendship solidarity and peace
156998 the key is to ensure that athletes from all countries will have a level playing field to compete fairly

157006 there was some early uproar when facebook first permitted applications about some of the music sharing apps
157007 what ultimately happened then was that the music sharing apps very rapidly were tweaked so that people werent doing any actual file sharing
157008 hasbro certainly couldve saber rattled and pushed the issue with facebook
157009 particularly under the grokster decision from a few years back facebook has to be very careful even if its getting indemnity from the people who are putting applications on the site that indemnity might not amount to much if theres very little there to back it up
157010 in fact in last weeks f8 conference announcement they said they are trying to award and sort out the good applications versus the not so good ones
157011 its posturing but its the way that they are ensuring that theyre not in bed with their application makers for this purpose
157012 strive s to work with developers to correct any issues we discover but when necessary we will act quickly to correct problems and ensure a safe and high quality facebook platform experience for all
157013 i think that this is a questionable area of intellectual property law and its not clear cut
157014 when things arent clear cut you dont necessarily go and cut off peoples access to platforms
157015 the thing is theres 400 000 developers using facebooks platform and theyre trying to find ways to be successful and that means copying games that are going to work
157016 theyre clearly trying to segment quality apps that help the user experience versus ones that dont
157017 look hes doing well and i have done well in the past

157023 the desire by shell petroleum development company to partner with private hands to reintroduce the mobile clinic scheme in the niger delta is a welcome development which president yaradua will appreciate he said that this is the reason other multi national oil and gas companies should emulate the good gesture of spdc by setting up their own mobile health scheme so that health care delivery would be carried to the door step of the riverine niger deltans

157076 our constitution is clear we the people hold the power we are a democracy but we are also a constitutional monarchy but for the power of government and giving assent to bills we give the power known as the royal prerogative to the queen to govern she governs in our name and according to the laws that we brought in to prevent her or the people in parliament from taking over power unfortunately this has been done both in the 1911 parliament act and in the reform of the constitution act of 2005 when blair and lord falconer took over the power we had given to the queen for her lifetime they then gave to parliament the right to decide on whether or not to go to war instead of putting the power under our laws that say we cannot go to war unless someone is attacking us
157077 this is not in fact true as both george iii queen victoria and edward vii all sent bills back

157089 old brains can continue to be plastic and make changes and clearly the learning of new tasks clearly is not exclusively in the realm of young people
157090 it may be true that as we age we have to develop some slightly different strategies from when you were young in order to facilitate learning new things
157091 but this ability for the brain to adapt as it ages means that it can continue to perform well in normal people well into old age

157207 tackling fuel poverty is a priority for this government and i am pleased to welcome derek as the new chair for the fuel poverty advisory group
157208 i know he is as determined as i am to address this issue and do everything possible to help people struggling to pay their fuel bills
157209 we are already supporting those most vulnerable to fuel poverty with warm front grants and winter fuel payments and have doubled the annual carbon savings through the carbon emissions reduction target a programme which will see energy suppliers investing 2 8 billion over three years in household energy efficiency to cut carbon footprints and energy bills
157210 i am sure that dereks experience in the energy industry will provide valuable insight into how vulnerable people can take advantage of the different offers in the market further strengthen our work with the industry and ensure we help households across england to take up the help that is available to them
157211 the challenge for the vulnerable consumer this winter to stay warm and well has never been greater
157212 record gas and electricity prices at present that are set to go even higher this winter demand immediate action to help those in society who are less able to help themselves
157213 i welcome this opportunity to work with the dedicated team of professionals that freely give their time to fpag and take on a challenge that is so urgent
157214 because the tide came in the animal was having great difficulty in righting itself and water was starting to lap around the blow hole
157215 a decision was taken to put the animal to sleep on welfare grounds
157216 as they made their way to the animal it did manage to right itself and it is now free swimming but in fairly shallow water so right now the prognosis is not good
157217 when an animal restrands for a second time it is often very poorly by that stage
157218 if it hasnt fed it hasnt drank as it gets its water from its food so we are going to have a very frightened distressed animal on our hands
157219 if this animal does strand again the only humane cause of action will be euthanasia however it is still free swimming at the moment
157220 the fire brigade turned up with several appliances they went down with loads of hoses and connected them from the mill pond and started pumping water over the whale
157221 its very very unusual we have had seals before but never a whale
157222 you can see it from a distance stuck on the flats i just hope they manage to get it back into the water
157223 at the moment the animal is bobbing around but if and when this animal comes back in it will have to be euthanised
157224 its not good news but is what we expect from these cases
157225 renal failure is predominantly due to dehydration because it hasnt eaten for at least 48 hours but it could well be longer than that
157226 muscle damage will also be a contributing factor from when it was stranded

157231 today is a crucial day in blackpools future and takes us one step closer to realising our dream of becoming an innovative inspirational and world renowned destination
157232 it is brilliant to know that government share our vision and have provided vital funding for this scheme
157233 the tower headland will provide something we have never had in blackpool before we are currently in position that we cannot hold some major events and performances as we dont have appropriate outdoor space available
157234 not only will the headland play host to the biggest events blackpool has ever seen it will also provide a fantastic opportunity for community groups and schools to put on smaller performances
157235 we are extremely pleased to have been granted this funding by the dcms which will be invested in the reinvention of the tower festival headland area of blackpools seafront
157236 we are dedicated to making blackpool a better place to live work and play through physical social and economic regeneration and this is another step forward in the transformation of the town we are determined that this first step and will lead to further investment by both private and public sectors
157237 the tower festival headland will embrace the towns heartland and raison detre creating a festival and events zone that aims to generate excitement for both residents and visitors
157238 an essential part of the towns regeneration masterplan the investment will not only provide a new entertainment zone it will provide new commercial and employment opportunities for businesses and residents of the town
157239 confirmation of this investment is great news for blackpool and for the region the resort has some exciting plans that will make the most of this culture led approach to regeneration playing on its expanding events programme and a growing reputation for dance
157240 the new performance space and improved streetscape will complement work already being undertaken on blackpools promenade and will create a vibrant public realm that will benefit residents and visitors

157242 this has been an extremely interesting course and helpfully will hopefully lead to improved services ensure that service users have more say in how their homes are run and help supporting people to find out if there are any problems
157243 i would encourage people to get involved with faircroft college who have been very helpful this course has boosted my confidence and made me feel i can do more for myself i will continue to work with supporting people to make improvements for residents
157244 the course was sheer hard work but i was prepared to graft and i am now reaping the rewards my insight and familiarity with support services having lived in hostel accommodation has equipped me with the knowledge to have a view of whats needed and what can be improved or changed with housing related support services in the city
157245 without nora my support worker from midland heart supporting people i would not have been able to complete the course i cant read or write and this course has given me so much confidence to go forward and learn more to graduate has been an amazing experience i never thought id get to this stage but look at what ive achieved
157246 we are extremely proud to have developed the only accredited training course of its kind in the uk working in partnership with fircroft college
157247 birminghams supporting people programme is the largest in the country and by working with a diverse group of individuals existing and former users of our services in the city we will continue to make improvements which will benefit some of the citys most vulnerable people

157250 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
157251 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
157252 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
157253 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
157254 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
157255 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
157256 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
157257 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
157258 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
157259 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
157260 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better

157262 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
157263 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
157264 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
157265 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
157266 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
157267 the discovery has enormous implications for the large scale deployment of solar since it puts us on the doorstep of a cheap and easily manufactured storage mechanism the ease of implementation means that this discovery will have legs

157269 this is just the beginning the scientific community is really going to run with this
157270 i just cant see how they can realistically aim gt for these targets
157271 my main concern is gt that business doesnt seem to be aware of the gt consequences of the population rise and theres no gt discussion about it
157272 why is obama not doing better in the national polls after his overseas trip
157273 is mr obama really struggling are these summer polls truly evidence of underperformance or fundamental weaknesses in his campaign
157274 voters might just not be ready to make a decision quite this early
157275 the idea was simple give u k readers frustrated with the bush administration a way to help drive him from office the left wing newspaper targeted one swing county in one swing state in ohio and invited readers to send one on one letters to independent american voters
157276 the response was huge and immediate more than 11 000 guardian readers across britain and soon around the world signed up for the project but almost as soon as operation clark county was announced right leaning media and bloggers counterattacked they masqueraded as interested lefties and got the paper to hand over some of the voters addresses
157277 consider this stay out of american electoral politics unless you would like a company of us navy seals republican to a man to descend upon the offices of the guardian bag the lot of you and transport you to guantanamo bay where you can share quarters with some lonely taliban shepherd boys
157278 in 2000 al gore won clark county by 324 votes

157282 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
157283 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
157284 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its current economic problems
157285 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
157286 no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american public
157287 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
157288 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
157289 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
157290 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
157291 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
157292 the discovery has enormous implications for the large scale deployment of solar since it puts us on the doorstep of a cheap and easily manufactured storage mechanism the ease of implementation means that this discovery will have legs
157293 the simplicity of this process is amazing using common and affordable elements and a glass of water these chemists may have given us a future way to efficiently obtain oxygen by splitting water
157294 this is just the beginning the scientific community is really going to run with this
157295 i just cant see how they can realistically aim gt for these targets
157296 my main concern is gt that business doesnt seem to be aware of the gt consequences of the population rise and theres no gt discussion about it
157297 i understand that they have to learn about other religions i can live with

157302 how does it feel to lose part of your dick
157303 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
157304 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
157305 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
157306 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
157307 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
157308 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
157309 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
157310 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
157311 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
157312 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
157313 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
157314 stimulating the economy improving the environment and reducing income inequality
157315 i understand that they have to learn about other religions i can live with

157321 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet

157324 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
157325 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
157326 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
157327 i felt like if youre going to clean something it really should be clean
157328 but i had seven children i wanted to go on home i told him im not staying these arent slavery times anymore he said i had to stay i walked
157329 one day we decided to march on the welfare office we asked to see their policies their manual of how they would treat us they said the state couldnt do that so we went up the back steps on a friday afternoon went into the directors office and told him we wouldnt let him leave
157330 storming caesars palace how black mothers fought their own war on poverty
157331 finally we understand that the civil rights movement was a lot bigger and longer than martin luther king as wonderful and important as he was
157332 there are so many levels on which this movement was important not only statewide but nationwide
157333 and theres no question ruby was in the absolute forefront
157334 as long as they graduated and walked across that stage that was enough
157335 it was exciting to see how poor people could stand up
157336 just the way she looked you could feel her power it was so uplifting
157337 im glad shes finally being recognized for all that shes done
157338 so many people give up homes so many jobless people
157339 let somebody make me wealthy before i leave just for one year
157340 i would buy me a nice home in a decent neighborhood i would have me a better car i would love to go to one of those hotels lay up and have a massage i would go to paris london italy i would live for once in my life
157341 the discovery has enormous implications for the large scale deployment of solar since it puts us on the doorstep of a cheap and easily manufactured storage mechanism the ease of implementation means that this discovery will have legs

157346 its t boone pickens different political party different persuasion than al saying weve got to move to renewables
157347 the democrats want to just do the renewable energy without additional production additional supply and chalk it up as a victory
157348 distorted t boone pickens words when he said we cant drill ourselves out of this problem
157349 he didnt mean we shouldnt be drilling and finding what we can
157350 he just said we need to do all these things
157351 it helps underscore why we believe gaining grass roots support for the pickens plan has been so successful and is such an integral part going forward
157352 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
157353 an oil man reacting to the largest transfer of wealth in history
157354 mr gores focus is primarily on solar wind and geothermal energy his belief is that a dramatic wholesale transition to these abundant and renewable sources of energy is not just doable but essential
157355 for years rep jay inslee d wash has been frustrated with congress inability to devise a clean energy policy so he decided to do something about it without markups or bills or committees he decided to write a book center for american progress inslee depicts an economic shift necessary to ease america into a clean energy revolution in the book which was released by island press on oct 1 2007
157356 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
157357 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
157358 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
157359 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
157360 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
157361 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
157362 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
157363 my husband is absolutley opposed to any negative campaigning at all
157364 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
157365 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
157366 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
157367 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
157368 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
157369 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
157370 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
157371 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
157372 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
157373 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
157374 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
157375 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
157376 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
157377 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
157378 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
157379 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
157380 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
157381 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
157382 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
157383 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
157384 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
157385 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
157386 i am in kabul now over the last few weeks i was in hamburg germany for a summer school on freedom and responsibilities in media what a wonderful occasion and what wonderful people from 18 countries who ive met there i miss all of them now and the only thing that remains with me are memories and pictures one of the topics we had to work on was dealing with the past working with 8 people from different countries in one group on how we can deal with the past is not such an easy job in most of the cases it is taboo to write about the past or it might not be so secure or even dangerous in a situation like afghanistan it is very difficult to write about criminals and the warlords who are in power right now but alas in our class we never thought about the hows and which methods we could use to write about our past but now i dont know what to do with these criminals who are in power and still threatening we only overviewed the history of germany and the time when the nazis committed genocide for several days my heart was wounded i couldnt imagine what happened to jewish people there but some times it was also very irritating when some of my colleagues were making funny pictures with the commemoration statue of a jew who died from the severe conditions of living in one of the concentration camps maybe they had only eyes to look at the statue and the pictures around them maybe they only have eyes to look but have no heart to feel may be most of us are like this without doubt who feels our pains here no one kabul
157387 could it be any better could i be happier is
157388 ill start from the day i left my outpost fob forward
157389 someone who is too cheap to use a real condom and ends wraping up their

157394 it can be frustrating knowing people who supported clinton and edwards who still say they dont know what to do
157395 hes in danger of being sucked into a negative campaign
157396 mccains trying to make him out to be a risky unsure leader he has to respond but has to stay above the fray its a very thin line
157397 the idea that voters pay attention to three or four critical moments of a campaign is a theory thats outmoded
157398 with the 24 hour news cycle you have a lot more process coverage and everything tends to flatten out instead of peaks and valleys you have more of a straight road a lot of times people simply arent paying attention to whats supposed to be a critical moment
157399 he has problems that no candidate has ever had before
157400 hes the first person of color to be the nominee of his party he had to show he could be on the international stage with foreign leaders and he did that now what he has to do is get back to relating to regular people gore had to do it and never quite succeeded to get there
157401 i tried to get him to water ski because he was good at it i tried to get him to play pick up basketball but he wouldnt do that because he thought hed be copying former new jersey sen bill bradley he played pool and he wouldnt do that in public either these were all things that would make him approachable to ordinary people and he just wouldnt do them that what obama has to do make the public understand what hes really like and how he relates to them
157402 americans are looking to see if he can do the job of president of the united states what we he have to do over the next 97 days in convince them he can
157403 the voters we need to get are people not a whole unlike obama
157404 they werent born into a wealthy family and theyve worked hard for what they have obviously you have to demonstrate hes a real person and thats the easiest thing in the world to do because hes the most down to earth candidate ive ever worked for and i think the size of events is important you look at today we have two town halls and a barbecue you cant get much closer to the ground than that i think thats the kind of campaign youll see us run for the rest of the race
157405 are you better off now than you were four years ago
157406 gas prices are not coming down in the near future
157407 if all electricity used in the united states can be produced by using sun wind and geothermal energy vehicles that operate on rechargeable batteries would become practical
157408 junk propaganda emanating from the intergovernmental panel on climate change and scientists like david suzuki et al
157409 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
157410 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
157411 it represents a challenge to all americans in every walk of life
157412 the survival of the united states of america as we know it
157413 the tendency to offer old solutions to each crisis separately without taking the others into account
157414 when we look at all three of these seemingly intractable challenges at the same time we can see the common thread running through them our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three
157415 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures that are needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
157416 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year
157417 and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
157418 the quickest cheapest most efficient and best way to start using all of this renewable energy is in the production of electricity
157419 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
157420 it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
157421 get us off oil make us energy independent invest in clean energy and create a new generation of high quality green collar jobs
157422 one more rustbowl outpost that crawled out of the wrong side of the 1980s
157423 our families cant stand 10 more years of gasoline price increases
157424 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
157425 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
157426 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
157427 hes got the emmy the oscar hes a nobel laureate why would he want to go back to that
157428 her favorite scene is me running naked covered in blood down a corridor with a chain saw in my hand she doesnt really understand why everyone found it so controversial
157429 i dont know an actor just tries to figure out a role
157430 i think too much is put into saving celebrities and we need do more about saving animals we need rehab for animals
157431 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
157432 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
157433 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
157434 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
157435 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
157436 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
157437 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
157438 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
157439 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
157440 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
157441 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
157442 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
157443 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
157444 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
157445 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
157446 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
157447 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
157448 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
157449 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
157450 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
157451 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
157452 the only republican who promises to end the of governing from and on behalf of a small angry fringe
157453 a broader range of americans than the rest of the republican field
157454 hard to find an issue on which he has not repositioned himself to the right since he was
157455 the real straight talker a profile in courage more seasoned than the current president a patriot of course honest and respected in the media he has all the pluses in the world of a sort of a you know an if you will a real war hero
157456 the environment is the voters number one concern about continued republican leadership of congress
157457 o ur nations continued prosperity hinges on our ability to solve environmental problems and sustain the natural resources on which we all depend
157458 we have two oilmen in the white house the logical follow up from that is 3 a gallon gasoline it is no accident it is a cause and effect a cause and effect
157459 the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
157460 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
157461 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
157462 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
157463 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
157464 today i challenge our nation to commit itself to becoming 100 apple users within the next ten years
157465 ask not what ford can do for you ask what gm product you can buy
157466 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
157467 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
157468 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
157469 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
157470 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
157471 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
157472 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
157473 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
157474 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
157475 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
157476 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
157477 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
157478 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
157479 my husband is absolutley opposed to any negative campaigning at all
157480 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
157481 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
157482 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
157483 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
157484 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
157485 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
157486 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
157487 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
157488 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
157489 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
157490 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
157491 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
157492 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
157493 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
157494 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
157495 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
157496 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
157497 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
157498 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
157499 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
157500 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
157501 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
157502 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
157503 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
157504 you know its not about you its about your country
157505 my husband is absolutley opposed to any negative campaigning at all
157506 this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they have a chance to kill
157507 this is one bleeding part of a budget and not just in one department but in a lot of departments
157508 when you have something bleeding like this there can be a lot of money saved
157509 from a management standpoint this is something that can easily be handled
157510 its critical use or necessary use versus well weve got the money lets go out and buy some more cars
157511 where that spike in overall costs came from i have no idea
157512 cost of paying one driver overtime to cover both weekday shifts and weekends would be prohibitive
157513 kind of a rule of thumb is the more cars you control the more powerful you are and so that sort of attitude of kingdom building is part of the problem here
157514 tax rebates have been a very effective way of propping up the economy in the second quarter and less so in the third quarter
157515 to fix the economic growth problems you have to restore liquidity to the system
157516 i think in the short run its going to be a tug of war between the optimists and the pessimists
157517 i think both sides are going to be able to find enough information to support their case
157518 the challenge is you cant identify what the catalyst is that will change psychology
157519 when a player like manny becomes available i dont think theres a manager in baseball who wouldnt say theyre interested
157520 we didnt plan in advance how to move things around
157521 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
157522 tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing
157523 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
157524 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
157525 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
157526 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
157527 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
157528 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
157529 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
157530 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
157531 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
157532 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
157533 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
157534 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
157535 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
157536 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
157537 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
157538 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
157539 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
157540 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
157541 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
157542 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
157543 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
157544 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
157545 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
157546 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
157547 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
157548 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
157549 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
157550 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
157551 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
157552 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
157553 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
157554 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
157555 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
157556 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
157557 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
157558 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
157559 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
157560 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
157561 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
157562 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
157563 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
157564 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
157565 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
157566 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
157567 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
157568 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
157569 there is no mountain over which you can see the future
157570 if america could land a man on the moon in 10 years why cant it
157571 the apollo program cost 25 4 billion about 150 billion in current dollars to land just 12 astronauts on the moon
157572 the interstate highway system was originally estimated to take 12 years and cost 25 billion to construct
157573 it actually took 35 years and cost 114 billion over 800 billion in current dollars
157574 fastracks is an overly ambitious bloated proposal that would raise the sales tax in many metro communities to near the limits of voter tolerance
157575 from each according to ability to each according to need
157576 capitalism works for the benefit of the smart hardworking and strong those are exactly the efforts that the left want to discourage
157577 if we can socalize a program and put a man on the moon why can t we
157578 from each according to their ability to each according to their need
157579 panic and fear co2 and demagoguery the sky is falling its too hot its too rainy really big hurricanes and more storms and tornadoes and lightning america awaken cease your evil ways and lift your eyes and arms and wallets to the man from tennessee heal oh mother earth heal heal heal please write for special carbon dispensation healing credits hurry calamity is knocking at the door already
157580 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
157581 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
157582 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
157583 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
157584 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
157585 en s n hade jag n r jag var liten
157586 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
157587 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
157588 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
157589 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
157590 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply
157591 is that the right kind of signal to send to the young people of this country who more than any time in recent memory are deeply involved in the political decisions that were making this year and young people who want to get into the political arena look to al gore and he said its all about trivia and nonsense
157592 the new internet based forms of organizing and mobilizing people
157593 what politics has become requires a level of tolerance for triviality and artifice and nonsense that i have found in short supply

157599 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
157600 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
157601 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
157602 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
157603 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
157604 believe that coupling an investment in alternative fuels with increased domestic production of oil is preferable to alternative fuel investment combined with energy conservation alone
157605 the only way to break free from the burden of rising gasoline prices and electricity rates is to get free
157606 bid up the price of every last drop of oil and every last lump of coal

157612 hes here to add competition for places and put pressure on our other keepers
157613 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
157614 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
157615 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
157616 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
157617 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
157618 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
157619 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
157620 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
157621 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
157622 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
157623 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
157624 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
157625 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
157626 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
157627 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
157628 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
157629 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
157630 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
157631 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
157632 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
157633 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
157634 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
157635 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
157636 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
157637 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
157638 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
157639 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
157640 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
157641 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
157642 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
157643 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
157644 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
157645 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
157646 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
157647 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

157650 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
157651 the regional fugitive task force is a program that works with local law enforcement to take the worst of the worst criminal offenders off the street florida is experiencing an increase in violent crime and this program is a priority
157652 this additional 10 million will help to expand the task forces presence in florida
157653 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
157654 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
157655 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
157656 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
157657 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
157658 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
157659 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
157660 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
157661 he needs to begin telling the american people how he intends to lead us that mccain exists he can inspire the country to greatness
157662 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
157663 medicare fraud wastes taxpayer dollars hurts legitimate businesses and shrinks the important resources that should be going to care for our seniors and disabled
157664 our bill will give cms and hhs the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred from pay and chase to detect and prevent
157665 each year roughly 30 to 60 billion a year in taxpayer dollars is wasted because of medicare fraud and abuse this hurts not only taxpayers but medicare recipients and legitimate providers as a result congress should do everything in its power to eliminate fraud and abuse this legislation we are introducing moves our efforts from a pay and chase model to one that takes proactive tangible steps to stop fraud before it begins i hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important effort to protect taxpayers and medicare recipients
157666 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
157667 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
157668 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
157669 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
157670 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
157671 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
157672 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
157673 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
157674 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
157675 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
157676 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
157677 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
157678 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
157679 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
157680 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
157681 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
157682 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
157683 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
157684 you can pry my poodle from my cold dead hands

157696 there is no question that any deal will be done with regards to didier

157709 meaning workers have more time for retirement and more time to collect social security
157710 you just cant have people living longer and longer and longer and have the program with a frozen normal retirement age of 67 it just doesnt make sense
157711 eventually people will have a larger and larger proportion of their lives spent in retirement until you reach the point where we just cant afford it
157712 all that were suggesting is that some increase in the retirement age should be part of any package
157713 barack obama is opposed to raising the retirement age he believes we should strengthen social security while protecting the middle class families that rely on it
157714 to that end he would like to work with congress on a plan to ensure that people making over 250 000 pay a little more to strengthen this vital program for generations to come
157715 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes or support a tax increase
157716 it doesnt affect us its absurd that the bears would claim they dont need favre i dont see it ever happening if it does we have a hall of fame quarterback playing for us if not we have two good quarterbacks as it is

157864 mays gdp report underlines the growth risks that have prevented the bank of canada from raising interest rates to counter inflation and such risks will likely remain throughout the third quarter
157865 this is the fourth decline in six months and indicates a growing softening trend in the canadian economy

157879 we are not machines and there could be differences in interpretation of the rules but we try to minimize that as much as possible
157880 just by cutting through that bar that still does not get you anywhere near out of the jail
157881 it would be naive for me to say there is no way they could have gotten out
157882 we have inmate work crews that go out trusties that go out into the free world every day and they try to get contraband in
157883 well be doing our best to find out how this might have got introduced

157964 there is no doubt in our eyes adams can carry the load in the acc he is an explosive thickly built runner with great initial burst and in line power ideal body structure and running style to develop into a high carry durable workhorse at the next level and wear down a defense by the 4th quarter maloof concurred with tucker s assessment calling adams a power back with 4 5 speed he can get the hard yardage he has great open field speed and a little open field wiggle which are the three things you need in division i football especially in the acc they re getting a great kid will md still pursue austin adams remains me of a lance ball type of back who can run between the tackles get tough yards portzel i think will be used more like bruce perry was in this offense i dont see austin shying away from any school because of other signees but you have to wonder how they plan to share the ball with the other two kids as well as scott and green who will be on the roster likely through the 2010 season i dont see austin playing rb at the next level hes just too small to hold up he could be a great wr or db and id love to have him i just doubt hed be best at rb certainly too small for an nfl rb the terps should go after austin harder than ever he is a reggie bush type of back one that can catch passes either out of the backfield or split wide you can run him between the tackles or toss it to him to get the corner and turn it upfield he can return kicks and break long runs both with his shiftiness and speed he can play with any other back at md usc had both bush and lendell white bush to play wherever and white to line up at tailback good coaches make room for a player like austin i think austin is thier top priority porzel has said already he will rs austin will probably be used in the slot and on plays that allow him to get into space and use his unbelievable skills to make plays adams will probably be your every down back with austin in the slot and porzel in on 3rd down and spelling adams a good deal either way all this talent on offense at the skill positions should attract a top qb next year when is the article on how great umd is recruiting this year coming out speaking of qbs i would love to see a list of the top rising qbs on the east coast assuming that they were starting as qbs in 2007 there should be a short list porzel should be a 59

158053 this program has helped us to take potential mass murderers off the streets before they have a chance to kill
158054 in my presence in the white house the possibility of using diego garcia for detaining high value targets was discussed
158055 given everything that we know about the administrations approach to the law on these matters i find the report that the u s did use the island for detention or interrogation entirely credible
158056 is a violation of u k law as well as of the bi lateral agreement governing the island
158057 our intelligence and counter terrorism relationship with the u s is vital to the national security of the united kingdom we accept u s assurances on rendition in good faith but if others have definitive evidence of rendition through the u k or our overseas territories including diego garcia then we will raise it with the u s authorities
158058 neither of those individuals was ever part of cias high value terrorist interrogation program
158059 i think its important the british government makes plain its deep concern that its not being told the truth and that our territories are being used for these purposes

158079 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
158080 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
158081 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
158082 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
158083 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
158084 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
158085 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
158086 thats just a wretched way to live a wretched way to run a school were all grown ups by this point and we shouldnt all be comparing ourselves to each other and they do that incessantly
158087 if youre a 27 year old who spent five years at goldman sachs you have some money in your pocket and you think youre going back into a world where youll make a ton more money two years at business school is kind of like a vacation and i know many who treated it like that
158088 since the classroom here is regarded as a safe haven for learning through intense and spirited daily discussions a private space for both teachers and students and since everyone on this campus is well aware of that community standard there is a certain amount of disappointment that mr broughton chose to violate that trust
158089 song selection and the pressure has really increased with two songs and preparing for the finale so in that sense it does feel kind of good to be done with that but i was welcoming the challenge as well
158090 we always say this show brings everything to the surface that might be an issue for you and that one is certainly one of them but i worked through it and at times had to work through it in a very public way
158091 i would love to perform on that american idol i dont really go and ask them a lot for stuff theyve done so much for me and my career already i wouldnt have the career i do without them maybe some people should call up idol and tell them they want to see old bo bice play on stage and they might let me
158092 id like to keep trying to do school while i work on music i think school is really important it was my main priority before this because i wasnt sure if i was going to get anywhere with music even if music does turn out to go somewhere for me youll never know how long it can last so i just want to have something that can back me up on that im still looking at options and careers id be interested in the future
158093 lately i find the ear nose throat doctor really interesting it would take a lot of education but its something that really interests me its something that helps people whove had the same problems as me ive had so many issues with that stuff so it would be great to study into that more and be able to help out with all those problems

158098 finalizar sexto o s ptimo las carreras o calificar en quinta posici n no es algo a lo que estuviera acostumbrado durante los tres ltimos a os cuando lo normal era luchar por las poles y subir al podio pero esto forma parte de este trabajo y el deporte es as hay altibajos nunca ganan los mismos el tour de francia o el mundial de f tbol ahora estamos en un momento complicado en el que necesitamos recuperarnos ganar en confianza como equipo pero no estoy preocupado tengo 27 a os llevo ya bastantes a os aqu y me acuerdo por ejemplo de michael schumacher que se pas cuatro a os en ferrari sin ganar el t tulo s que debo tener paciencia y trabajar duro para volver a ganar alg n d a
158099 no lo he olvidado cuando recuerdo tensi n aqu fue m s en 2006 cuando luchaba con michael por el campeonato del mundo entonces la sanci n s que me pareci muy injusta un segundo de penalizaci n por doornbos y otra cosa as y ese a o lo recuerdo m s que el a o pasado lo del a o pasado no fue ninguna sanci n ni ning n problema con hamilton ni nada fue una decisi n que tom el equipo yo ten a que dar una vuelta m s al final el piloto no hizo caso todos se re an en el equipo y por tanto ellos tomaban la decisi n parec a que todo el mundo estaba contento y ah fue cuando entend hay que salir de ah en cuanto puedas

158133 banks must find ways to mitigate the burden of high interest rate and adopt methods like mobilising low cost deposits

158136 unfortunately the situation has caught up with us now where once again they are obliged to go back on the international market to buy gas for the forthcoming period
158137 the gas prices have gone through the roof and we have had to pay very much more for our gas supplies
158138 although we have done our best to keep the tariffs down as low as we possibly can and there is already a substantial element of subsidy in the electricity price it has not been possible to absorb these huge increases

158148 o pessoal da ilha sempre bem representado pelo grupo do samba de v io mas ali est apenas uma parte um pedacinho daquela comunidade a id ia interagir com a popula o ampliar as possibilidades da arte se propagar na cidade por isso vamos realizar o aldeia na ilha
158149 sei que muitas pessoas n o entender o essa escolha e ir o contest la mas n o tenho a mesma motiva o para o heptatlo foi ao mesmo tempo uma decis o dif cil e simples que tomei conversando comigo mesma

158152 in retrospect although my concern for biosafety was honest and my desire to refrain from crying wolf was sincere i should have notified my supervisor ahead of time of my worries about a possible breach in biocontainment
158153 i thought that quietly and diligently cleaning the dirty desk area would both eliminate any possible anthrax contamination as well as prevent unintended anxiety at the institute
158154 i honestly do not recall if follow up swabs were taken of the area
158155 i may have done so but i do not now remember reswabbing
158156 if theres contamination you always reswab and you would remember doing it
158157 he didnt have any more money to spend on legal fees he was much more emotionally labile in terms of sensitivity to things than most scientists he was very thin skinned
158158 ill tell you we made great progress in the investigation
158159 i was questioned by the feds and i sung like a canary
158160 ich w nsche mir dass er dies auch k nftig als mitglied der spd aus ihr heraus wird leisten k nnen
158161 dies galt und gilt auch f r manch anderes mitglied der partei
158162 nur das macht die spd mehrheitsf hig und nur darauf kommt es an
158163 gestern ging es etwas wild hin und her und ich k nnte mir vorstellen dass das heute so weiter geht
158164 bis zum us arbeitsmarktbericht d rften die kurse auf diesem niveau seitw rts laufen
158165 nach ford hat es mit daimler und bmw nun selbst die wenig finanzierungsabh ngigen hersteller getroffen
158166 der markt will derzeit einfach einen st rkeren greenback haben
158167 ab der marke von 1 57 usd wollte aber pl tzlich niemand mehr euro kaufen
158168 es hat es den anschein dass einige marktteilnehmer die nachlaufenden konjunkturindikatoren zu arbeitsmarkt und wirtschaftswachstum nunmehr etwas schw cher gewichten h here bedeutung messen sie den sentimentindikatoren mit prognosecharakter bei die f r die usa zuletzt gar nicht so schlecht ausgefallen sind
158169 f llt der arbeitsmarktbericht mit einem r ckgang um beispielsweise nur 40 000 weniger schlecht als bef rchtet aus und erf llt der ism index gleichzeitig die erwartungen k nnte der euro zun chst unter den widerstand bei 1 5510 usd fallen und dann bis in den bereich von 1 5430 usd durchrutschen
158170 wir gehen im laufenden gesch ftsjahr im konzern von einer umsatzrendite vor steuern von mindestens 4 aus
158171 the best way to solve problems is not to have enemies
158172 there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
158173 israelis are not civilians and there are no prohibitions of killing them
158174 the walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand
158175 lawsuit filed to challenge california ballots inflammatory rewording of marriage amendment
158176 amends the california constitution to provide that only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
158177 changes california constitution to eliminate right of same sex couples to marry provides that only a marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
158178 revenue loss mainly sales taxes totaling in the several tens of millions of dollars to state and local governments
158179 what proposition 8 would do is eliminate the right of same sex couples to marry which is exactly what the attorney general put in the title of the measure
158180 we feel the ballot language is so inflammatory that it will unduly prejudice voters against the measure
158181 proposition 8 simply seeks to restore the definition of marriage back to its original meaning of the previous 158 years of california statehood
158182 guys guys it looks like its getting a little hot and heavy in here
158183 before we take this to the next level we want to make sure that you know how to use a condom
158184 it seems to make fun of sex making it as some kind of game as planned parenthood claims when sex is something so sacred that it should only be between a married man and woman
158185 we wanted to empower people to really take care of their own reproductive and sexual health
158186 through the web site and the videos we wanted to speak in a language that would be non threatening to a younger demographic
158187 this web site was especially repulsive to me because it appeals first to very young teenagers and contains scientifically inaccurate information but also because it denigrates sexual intimacy
158188 for men especially regular testing does not show threat information on human papillomavirus hpv or herpes
158189 after the battles there is blood on the ground things will get worse
158190 the position of the court is that all parties involved in this matter should maintain the status quo so that the res substance of the matter will not be destroyed
158191 it is hereby ordered that parties should maintain the status quo and should not take any step pending the hearing of all applications
158192 this order is not capable of being obeyed because this court cannot sit as an appellate court on the judgment of the international court of justice at the hague all the issues in this case as well as the final cession of bakassi are fallouts from the judgment of the icj
158193 we know that we are bound by the judgment of the icj the presidency did not submit the green tree agreement to the national assembly for ratification while the legislature also failed in its oversight functions to call the president to order we are challenging the agreement and we are surprised that the president has said he would go ahead to hand over in the face of it nigeria has not done what it is supposed to do before implementing the agreement
158194 new bakassi is already inhabited by people other than bakassi people and the inhabitants are hostile to the bakassi refugees
158195 directing the respondents to resettle them at nsutana iyata in cross river or any other area or location in the state where they might choose by way of plebiscite or referendum
158196 appear to misunderstand and subsequently misrepresent the substance of church teaching on these difficult but important ethical questions
158197 our moral obligations to patients who exist in what has come to be called a persistent vegetative state
158198 m y father has judged that the burden of persisting in a vegetative state far outweighs the benefit of being sustained that way this in my view is a very catholic way of thinking
158199 that claim has no foundation in the text and is actually contradicted
158200 the church insists on the important distinction between validly withdrawing a life sustaining means because the means itself is burdensome and wrongly withdrawing it because in someones view life itself has become burdensome
158201 by omitting food and fluids what are we trying to achieve
158202 whose burden are we trying to ease assisted feeding is often not difficult or costly to provide in itself but the housing nursing care and other basic needs of a helpless patient can be significant to discontinue assisted feeding in order to be freed from such burdens puts the caregivers interests ahead of the patients even if we prefer not to recognize the reality of our choice
158203 the danger is obvious if the church is going to face up to a growing movement for euthanasia and assisted suicide in the united states catholic universities must help in that important battle

158209 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations
158210 current market conditions mean it is imperative that the fsa reacts quickly to any potential abuse of the market
158211 this will not always uncover evidence of market abuse nor lead to enforcement action market participants should however expect that our surveillance and investigation activity will continue at a high level of intensity

158229 it is an umbrella agreement which provides for any facility notified by india to the agency in the future to become subject to safeguards
158230 which have invariably been adopted by this body swiftly and by consensus
158231 precisely because it is an umbrella agreement that does not identify specific facility under supervision india will also be able in the future to add other facilities engaged in peaceful nuclear activities to that list and place them under safeguards
158232 the deal will allow new facilities to be placed under supervision the agency will thus be able to give assurances about the peaceful use of a greater number of facilities

158235 from foreigners point of view it might seem like a slowdown in reform but fukuda sees it as steady reform
158236 i see this as a cabinet reshuffle to show that fukuda wants to call a general election under his leadership
158237 i think an election is highly likely around the end of year to the beginning of next year but its possible that itll be earlier than that thats what we will be calling for
158238 it sends a signal that the ldp is not coming up with fresh new ideas that i think is going to be a losing strategy i mean he is a throw back to old style politics
158239 ok he can talk about how many manga he reads but he is from the old school
158240 there are many in the ruling bloc who have a sense of crisis that they cannot win an election under fukuda

158244 when you look at the stadiums youll find that the stands are virtually empty while the bars and the joints that have satellite tv are full people will pay to watch the premier league on tv but not to watch nigerian football live
158245 in the 1980s i was the only person in my area who was watching english football
158246 when a player wont even be paid 1 000 2 000 per month in nigeria but can get 1 000 a week in europe what do you expect
158247 young people are inspired by the premier league it spurs them on to play and the money the teams get when they move to europe is good for the clubs

158370 weve got to look to get up and touch wood if we do we have to look and see where we go from there
158371 if we sell half the team now where do you go and replace them if you do go up youve no chance because theres a dearth of talent about and everybody is holding onto what they have
158372 its going to be a hard league and everybody thinks were just going to walk away with it but i know from experience of playing these teams in cup competitions that were the big fish and were there to be shot at
158373 every game is going to be a cup final for them and were not taking it lightly or taking anything for granted
158374 weve got to be fully committed and fully focused for every game throughout the season
158375 the likes of andy hunter and tim mouncey needed no persuasion to come and others like andrew sproule who has signed from dergview has a point to prove
158376 everybody we have signed has come in with the right attitude there is no one coming here stepping down a level and trying to end their careers by picking up a few easy quid
158377 it is a massive disappointment because the opportunity was there
158378 we got off to a great start but the penalty miss was a big turning point
158379 after that i thought we controlled the game to a certain extent and had some very good chances which we didnt convert and at any level if you dont take chances it comes back to haunt you
158380 the two goals were sloppy but at the end of the day we had a great opportunity to progress and we didnt take it and the boys know that
158381 they were happy to hit us on the counter attack and we struggled to come to terms with the change in their tactics and how to break their system down which was to try and get the ball wide but we didnt do that enough
158382 overall we had the chances and that is the most disappointing thing
158383 now we have to forget about it we have been brought back down to reality and what we have to focus on now is our first league game against ballymena next week
158384 well get the boys home and well have a debrief try and work out where we went wrong and then learn from that
158385 we cant sit moping around and feeling sorry for ourselves we have to move on and think about the bigger picture which in my eyes is always the league championship
158386 if you uttered decommissioning you would get slaughtered even now
158387 you would lose the leadership i can see no form of decommissioning this side of the general general john de chastelain of the independent international commission on decommissioning going
158388 have made their minds up and are adamant that if there is no form of decommissioning before the general goes then they intend to treat loyalists as criminals
158389 theres no discussion or debate about it in the loyalist community and i think theres probably a lack of understanding from those in the chattering classes who make the demands but have no idea of the processes of delivery nor do they engage in order to help people move forward
158390 engage with people seek to understand where people are at and what things need to happen in order to deliver
158391 but what i do see is a loyalist community under pressure and its not from weapons
158392 if we can identify people they will go for their tea
158393 people will not let them the loyalist paramilitaries continue to play the game they are playing of talking and talking and talking and doing nothing
158394 you are thrown in with the rest of the criminals
158395 lets say someone wants to reach for a weapon it goes right to the very top
158396 it gave orders youre a soldier you obey and if you have another opinion you keep it to yourself
158397 there are things you can do individually though to save energy
158398 making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
158399 i think that when he arrived in f1 nelson relied a lot on his natural talent and his innate ability
158400 then he understood that this was not enough so he dug deep and worked hard
158401 others took another course and are far ahead of us now
158402 two years ago the r26 was a very good car in the corners and on the straights
158403 did the freeze harm us perhaps yes renault has always had a good engine and this year we realise that we are a little bit behind
158404 it is always a difficult thing going to the limits of the legalities maybe we have been more legal than the other teams and have lost 20 or 30 horse power for that reason
158405 to spend so long without testing it is not a good sign
158406 there are also good new generation red bull drivers and toro rosso is aligned with the new generation
158407 ideally we would like to have a young driver next to an experienced one
158408 we also have to see how bourdais develops over the second half of the season
158409 schumacher was screaming what the fucking hell were you doing in the road he seemed cross as if i was in the wrong i called the police
158410 an officer came in and said this guys claiming to be michael schumacher then another told us shed seen his id and it was him
158411 he still didnt apologise he just got back in the van and drove off without even looking at me he was arrogant
158412 there was a collision but nobody was injured michael cooperated with police there is nothing else we wish to say
158413 well you dont know the half charlie and i have an arrangement if you dont believe me ask her
158414 yes i have the question you have to answer is that would you make such an arrangement with me
158415 i dont know you like that but i have always dug you tremendously
158416 well up to this point i thought you had a man
158417 you right that was mad immature i thought you were spoken for who wouldnt i know if i had the opportunity you would be spoken for
158418 well dan tres play your cards right and it might work out that way
158419 errr weve had testicular cancer yellow weve had racism a black one and a white one interlinked how witty poverty and some tsunami shit one as well what else can we have were scraping the bottom of the barrel now what about bullying
158420 dont go to work dont spend any money shut off all the power and we the people will then have the power to get what we want
158421 ibms innovations have been a cornerstone of the research triangle park and durham county and this new state of the art data center certainly continues that outstanding legacy
158422 this new data center is part of ibms commitment to construct the worlds most advanced data centers
158423 this is the latest example of ibms deep history of innovation in north carolina
158424 when we open for business in late 2009 the new ibm data center assures that research triangle park will be a strategic location for our outsourcing business for many years to come
158425 cloud computing is fundamentally about re engineering the worlds computing infrastructure to enable game changing even life changing applications
158426 to ibm cloud computing is much more than the normal evolution of a data center
158427 die arbeitslosigkeit in sterreich ist im juli zwar das 30
158428 die zeiten sind nach wie vor gut die besten zeiten sind aber vorbei
158429 you cant give anyone freedom anymore than you can give him an education both have to be seized by his own effort
158430 they were so good they would just sit and wait
158431 we dont want to pretend to be doctors or nurses
158432 teachers deserve a school nurse because their time should be spent teaching
158433 they think the school nurse is nice little job where you take care of boo boos
158434 school nurses work very hard to make sure every child gets exactly what they need
158435 the nurses provide great services for our students but so do all the other positions that weve cut
158436 there needs to be somebody in there that knows what theyre doing
158437 it can be scary dropping your child off at school wondering if that will be the day they might have a medical emergency and wondering if that is the day you might be lucky to have a school nurse there
158438 personally i think for democracy to exist opposition is key
158439 the only thing worse than having no taste is having no shame
158440 the real reason that we cant have the ten commandments in a courthouse is because you cannot post
158441 fat drunk and stupid is no way to go through life son
158442 ive seen a look in dogs eyes a quickly vanishing look of amazed contempt and i am convinced that basically dogs think humans are nuts
158443 nach einem etwa zweiw chigen station ren aufenthalt wird kevin mit rehabilitationsma nahmen beginnen k nnen wenn alles optimal l uft sollte der wirbelk rper in einigen monaten wieder voll belastbar sein

158445 ich habe am letzten berg das tempo versch rft der titel tut gut
158446 ich habe sehr viel trainiert und bin momentan k rperlich am ende aber ich bin insgesamt nicht unzufrieden
158447 i dont have the strength in my arms for such a long climb
158448 ive been down here two days with nothing to drink but that cask of wine over there im beginning to find it most enjoyable
158449 id love to my dear but i suspect half of the ships contents fell on that door over there when the ship keeled over
158450 sila glan i know your companion alin bredan has already told me my name is jalia aldare
158451 such a pretty name jalia aldare im sure ive heard it somewhere before
158452 no its completely gone i didnt even recognise my own name when you told me this is very good wine you should try some theres still more than half a cask left
158453 don untie that rope and throw it to me i can use it to rescue the lady sila
158454 you havent any idea how to get this one back to the steam dragon have you the whole thing got me beaten id carry him on my back if it was a matter of walking but i could never get the two of us across if i have to travel hand over hand along that line
158455 cut off ten feet of the rope before you throw it to me tie that around alin and then over the mooring line so that his weight is taken by the rope with any luck hell slide down the line most of the way without you having to do anything to help then all he has to do is take his weight on the line while you move the rope forward one of the crew might even be able to throw him a line from the dragon when he gets close enough and then they could pull him up
158456 i can see why you always win when you fight
158457 if i throw this rope to you can you climb up it
158458 i remember who you are now you are the girl who destroyed the miners association because they murdered your boyfriend thats really quite funny when i think about it
158459 they didnt kill daniel we just let them believe that they had it made it easier for the two of us to sneak into telmar and kill them all
158460 so why did you assassig assanigmate asagignate kill them all then
158461 because we had no other choice the gold at brinan was lost forever but that fact hadnt stopped the association coming after us seeking to get it back they tried to capture and torture the location of the gold out of us twice before we realised we had no choice but to stop them it was a matter of survival either us or them and we much preferred to survive besides which they were all slavers and i hate slavers
158462 well then its all done with isnt it a woman like me can always get by provided she keeps a little money in reserve
158463 so come and rescue me hero because i am certainly in need
158464 can you tie yourself to this rope if i lower it to you
158465 but a mite of a girl like you could never lift me up not with my bag and im not planning on leaving here without it
158466 it could well get you killed if i get it wrong
158467 as opposed to dying down here if you do nothing
158468 i shall take my chances with the heros plan however dangerous
158469 that is your brake if it doesnt work you will be pulled out to a watery grave
158470 if you have any gods you believe in you might want to start praying to them
158471 we have to climb the mast and take the rope up with us
158472 we need to hurry drop that bag of yours its slowing us down
158473 die arbeit tr gt erste fr chte wir haben uns mannschaftlich sehr gut pr sentiert
158474 wir gehen zur ck zu den wurzeln die kombination hat genug potenzial um als attraktive sportart neben dem skispringen und langlauf zu bestehen
158475 dazu braucht sie ein format dass durch den wiederholungseffekt f r zuschauer und medien nachvollziehbar ist das darf nicht l nger als ein fu ballspiel dauern

158481 die ioc koordinierungskommission und bocog haben sich vergangene nacht getroffen und sich geeinigt jetzt kann das internet genutzt werden wie bei allen olympischen spielen zuvor
158482 die chinesische regierung und das chinesische volk haben ernsthaft daran gearbeitet die verpflichtungen gegen ber der internationalen gemeinschaft zu erf llen
158483 es sch chtert schon ziemlich ein wenn man merkt das unsere arbeit hier permanent berwacht wird
158484 nach dem ganzen hin und her in den letzten tagen bin ich schon sehr berrascht das es heute alles geht
158485 es sch chtert schon ziemlich ein wenn man merkt das unsere arbeit hier permanent berwacht wird das ist nicht wirklich die atmosph re die man zu olympischen spielen erwarten w rde
158486 mich hat das problem nicht ber hrt ich habe auch schon vorher alle information die ich brauchte aus dem internet bekommen
158487 existe um aumento dos fatores de incerteza e desestabiliza o no contexto internacional a economia chinesa enfrenta dificuldades crescentes e desafios

158490 ich bin sicher auch madrid h tte sich in der qualifikation einen anderen gegner gew nscht
158491 das ist ein hammer los der schwerstm gliche gegner f r uns aber ich bin sicher auch madrid h tte sich in der qualifikation einen anderen gegner gew nscht
158492 schalke ist sicherlich nicht der beste aber auch nicht der schlechteste gegner f r uns trotzdem gehen wir optimistisch in die spiele tatsache ist dass das r ckspiel in madrid ist und das ist ein vorteil f r uns
158493 das ist eine paarung die man sicher eher f rs achtel oder viertelfinale denkt aber wir wollen um jeden preis in die gruppenphase und m ssen deshalb auch diesen gegner schlagen einen favoriten sehe ich nicht die chancen auf ein weiterkommen stehen 50 50
158494 das ist schon der gr te einzel erfolg meiner karriere und bedeutet mir sehr viel
158495 erkl rte bodmer als belohnung darf er beim sommer grand prix am kommenden wochenende in hinterzarten gegen die weltspitze antreten

158500 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
158501 i pretty much knew it but i never had the proof
158502 yeah no big deal lets blow some stuff up and laugh it off
158503 why do you think mary cheney always seems so jovial
158504 if you know a series is going to get canceled it cannot end in a cliff hanger
158505 i seem to remember the latter being somewhat like brisco county jr but it was 25 years ago

158510 you dont like banana splits what are you some kind of a commie
158511 the only i question i still have is whether or not tony blames sam for what happened
158512 no one will see them but some security guard and an unhappy mail carrier
158513 trust honesty integrity i dont like those words not one little bit jerry
158514 i sometimes think the writers try and figure out what would be the typical tv plot line and then head in the exact opposite direction
158515 if you ever think about turning that triangle into a square
158516 compared to the crap that buffy season 1 was this actually looks ok
158517 please dont pee on the carpet i just put it down
158518 benjamin rip off that shirt we gotta get you lubed up
158519 i cant trust andi i dont want to put her in danger
158520 the quality of the marking process is highly suspect and unfairly casts doubts on the professionalism and the integrity of school leaders their staff and the laudable efforts of the pupils in their care
158521 until schools are satisfied that all returned scripts have been submitted for full and thorough review with marks and levels accordingly adjusted naht members will continue to have absolutely no confidence or trust in the reliability of this years ks2 and ks3 test data
158522 ofqual will be closely monitoring the review process to ensure that it is carried through accurately and objectively so that pupils get the marks their work deserves
158523 there are some real question marks of the quality of marking
158524 my union would have preferred the holding back of the results until at least the national assessment agency did the job of looking at all the marks so there could be some real confidence in the system
158525 schools across the country have reported wildly erratic and inconsistent marking and there will be a significant number of appeals
158526 bye bye to you sarkozy and to your french missiles are going to shake your grounds until you cooperate fn french bastards of interpol so forth

158532 this is walter freakin skinner of the f b i and i am going to jail big time
158533 when i heard my wife died i could barely finish my lunch
158534 the main reason i went into medicine was for the laughs that and the pussy but that dried up ten years ago if youll pardon the expression
158535 our big goal was to make the show four things funny sad strange and beautiful to have those be the informing ideas and nothing else anybody who felt like a misfit growing up appreciated the show because more than anything the show is trying to say that weird is good
158536 but did you know who played the part of ice cream headed mr whippy it was michael stipe from rem
158537 maybe action was too edgy maybe firefly was too good for tv maybe i was the only one who liked vanished
158538 when a show is on fox you can bet itll get a chance
158539 better not get too attached to it because its on fox
158540 its a controlled substance cause its good like that so fags try and steel it from peoples backyards until they get stomped into reality and realize what really works for them
158541 preach the gospel at all times when necessary use words
158542 tore the very fabric of our communion at its deepest level
158543 exercise an enhanced responsibility in offering guidance on doctrinal moral and pastoral matters
158544 we were disappointed when it was removed as a point scoring option from the english entry level scheme
158545 we need to get something ready by the end of this year
158546 this should ensure that the scheme reaches the 2009 target of 1 7m ha
158547 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy
158548 i am sure that yahoo management will take a verbal beating
158549 i just dont think that the annual meeting is where the debate over yahoo strategy is going to take place
158550 no matter how strongly a large number of shareholders feel about the boards previous actions
158551 this combined with a weak gdp figure for q2 raises the possibility that the economy as a whole could see a contraction in q3
158552 looked for other types of people to bring to the show maybe more real life sci fi shows can get insular sometimes its good to see characters interact with real people every so often instead of just people who know the secret or robots
158553 both the show and movie take certain inspiration from terminator mythology like the value of self sacrifice perseverence and faith but when we deposited sarah connor in the present day we instantly created a new timeline and mythology for her
158554 people always say something to me at the pharmacy the produce section or the airport i always feel like im disappointing in real life just reaching for the celery
158555 surprised and thrilled at how many people are watching our show people are seeing the show and are really excited about it
158556 he was able but didnt have blood in him to be a leader
158557 the plan was to keep him young have long hair go to school and be normal his essence of youth and innocence still there a lot of that dies at the beginning of this season the writers are trying to do it subtly in the script
158558 in a region linked with mexico through family and economic ties they say the fence sends a message that mexicans including those who enter legally arent welcome
158559 mcallen mayor richard cortez shares concern that the fence alienates legal visitors and hurts the economy
158560 u s customs and border protection agency doesnt need the fence because it has other means of control such as clearing riverbanks of brush so agents can spot people crossing
158561 were going to make plenty of noise and yet potentially have more stability and success than weve had historically in the fourth quarter well be focused in the fall with two new series one comedy and one drama and then use our big assets in january to launch an even more powerful second season
158562 we are seeing a trend of vouchers for everything now there is a whole generation of consumers voucheristas i call them who will track down a discount on anything
158563 if they dont eat cornflakes but you have to buy a box cornflakes to get a deal thats what they will do
158564 people are getting more price sensitive and companies in the days out market know that thats why there are so many deals at the moment
158565 do we only have one f b i agent in this town
158566 closed captioning is sponsored by terminator the sarah connor chronicles now online at ctv ca
158567 since when does john want to go to school hes certainly changed
158568 kyle said listen and understand the machine is out there it cant be bargained with it cant be reasoned with it doesnt feel pity or remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop ever until you are dead
158569 if the show does get picked up for a second season we now have the mystery of why cromartie didnt kill ellison did he consider ellison inconsequential or was ellison necessary for skynets future
158570 i can think of at least two ways in which cameron could survive that blast the first is that the explosion didnt affect her chip and she could repair herself and grow her skin back although it was mentioned that terminators could be destroyed with intense heat second another terminator model just like her is sent back
158571 its science fiction on fox its on the bubble as of right now but its an expensive series that gets mediocre ratings by foxs standards im just waiting for the final word
158572 ign tv laughs okay gotcha the show is doing well in the ratings but everyone wonders is it doing well enough and speculating that because its such an expensive show it might be a harder sell for renewal should the fans be optimistic based on what youre hearing
158573 shooting him like that in front of her was as cold as any robot
158574 she would not be the first human to be fooled by a machine
158575 the demon hand revolved around the hand the t 888 that shot derek reese lost in his fight with cameron dont you know anything
158576 i bet it lasts two weeks before the cliches bury it for good
158577 imagine hypothetical situations and how you would react to them time pass or make lists ration places you want to see
158578 make stories for co attendees like that woman in a red saree on your rights is married to her cousin
158579 just look directly in to the trainers eye and creep them out
158580 imagine the presenters naked or better if hot mentally undress them come on dont say no just because were married
158581 give all attendees names depending on the way they smell
158582 think of yourself in any other profession and how your normal day in that life would be
158583 we had our education paid for and now its our turn to pass it on
158584 however the party has kept open the alternative of a majority government by making alliance with a few parties if a consensus government failed to take shape
158585 very clearly the insurgency is in no position to overthrow the government or really even to challenge it
158586 its actually almost in no position to try to confront it by and large whats left of the insurgency is just trying to hang on
158587 were getting close to something that looks like an end to mass violence in iraq
158588 weve put out the forest fire now were dealing with pop up fires
158589 we are now in our third consecutive month with reduced violence levels holding steady
158590 to relieve the burden on our forces and it will make life easier for our wonderful military families
158591 report that there now appears to be a degree of durability to the gains that we have made
158592 weve got to work to have a comprehensive plan that takes advantage of our assets theres no more source of reliable electricity than coal
158593 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
158594 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
158595 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
158596 la soluzione del problema complesso e delicato non potr essere affidata a una sola categoria di persone ma dovr essere portata avanti da tutte le categorie interessate
158597 al riguardo ci siamo accordati per sottolineare il bisogno dinformazione e di educazione dei cybernauti
158598 e gli operatori di telecomunicazioni dovranno assumere un ruolo attivo sensibilizzando e informando costantemente gli abbonati
158599 le modifiche ovviamente non dovranno portare ad un aggravio significativo dei costi
158600 esprimiamo il nostro forte disappunto e una ferma condanna di questa risoluzione che vincola tra loro temi senza alcun nesso come i diritti umani la libert religiosa il problema del darfur e della birmania insieme con le olimpiadi di pechino e critica il governo cinese senza alcuna ragione
158601 sono animati dalla malvagia intenzione di politicizzare sabotare e rovinare i giochi

158607 whenever we get in the car he jumps in too because he wants to come with us
158608 and when mum comes back he jumps on her lap like an excitable puppy
158609 he is stubborn but really thinks he is part of the family
158610 in an officious and controlling manner productive of strife rather than harmony
158611 on the assumption that mr a was his biological father
158612 the kids couldnt even use the same toilets they had to walk a few hundred metres from their shed
158613 i was stunned when our seven year old daughter came back in tears saying she had been told she wasnt allowed to use the swings because they were only for the germans how do you explain that to a kid her age
158614 i wasnt surprised to find you had to be at the pool by 7am to bag a sun lounger but this was something else we were treated like second class citizens
158615 the package holiday was a lot of money but we thought at least we wont have to pay much more when we get there and the kids will love it
158616 we chose the place because it promised loads for them including a brazilian football club superstar stage school and family entertainment
158617 the germans might have had that but we wouldnt know as we werent allowed near the kids club we ended up hiring a car and paying extra for days out or they would have been bored out of their minds

158724 the one who anointed the lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair
158725 the history of the word climaxes in the word becoming flesh
158726 it is clear from the new testament that the primary means by which the church grew was through the preaching of the gospel
158727 we proclaim christ crucified a stumbling block to jews and foolishness to gentiles
158728 the act of proclaiming or preaching was not the giving of opinions or of reinterpreting old religious traditions in new and creative ways
158729 faith comes through what is heard and what is heard comes through the word of christ
158730 the soundest methodological starting point for doing theology is the gospel since the person of jesus is set forth as the final and fullest expression of gods revelation of his kingdom
158731 another reason for beginning with jesus christ is that our encounter with him is where our faith journey begins
158732 all biblical texts testify in some way to jesus christ
158733 what is the role of preaching in this grand plan of salvation
158734 the prologue to johns gospel reminds us that the divine communication by which the worlds were made is the same word that has taken human flesh in order to dwell among us
158735 in making the comparison between moses and jesus john does not detract from the ministry of moses but links it to the greater word of god that brings grace and truth
158736 this is confirmed by the way he moves very quickly to incorporate the account of the cleansing of the temple in chapter 2
158737 the effect of johns treatment of the logos in this prologue passage is to place the incarnation of the living word jesus firmly in the context of salvation history in israel and to extend the line of this holy history back to the creation and behind that to the preexistence of christ as the eternal word of god
158738 the word of god by which all things were created is the word that establishes a covenant with a people being redeemed and that finally bursts into our world as the god man immanuel john begins his gospel by recalling the first words of the book of genesis but in so doing he identifies the word of god by which creation was effected as the same word that became flesh

158740 jes s subi a la monta a y llam a su lado a los que quiso
158741 juan el disc pulo del se or el mismo que descans sobre su pecho public tambi n el evangelio cuando se encontraba en feso
158742 entonces llamando a sus doce disc pulos les dio autoridad sobre los esp ritus inmundos para que los echasen fuera y para sanar toda enfermedad y toda dolencia
158743 y los disc pulos vi ndole andar sobre el mar se turbaron diciendo un fantasma y dieron voces de miedo
158744 el cual dondequiera que le toma le sacude y echa espumarajos y cruje los dientes y se va secando y dije a tus disc pulos que lo echasen fuera y no pudieron
158745 y estando jes s en betania en casa de sim n el leproso vino a l una mujer con un vaso de alabastro de perfume de gran precio y lo derram sobre la cabeza de l estando sentado a la mesa
158746 mas todo esto sucede para que se cumplan las escrituras de los profetas entonces todos los disc pulos dej ndole huyeron
158747 e id pronto y decid a sus disc pulos que ha resucitado de los muertos y he aqu va delante de vosotros a galilea all le ver is he aqu os lo he dicho
158748 por tanto id y haced disc pulos a todas las naciones bautiz ndolos en el nombre del padre y del hijo y del esp ritu santo
158749 aconteci que al pasar l por los sembrados un d a de reposo sus disc pulos andando comenzaron a arrancar espigas
158750 y sin par bolas no les hablaba aunque a sus disc pulos en particular les declaraba todo
158751 entonces los ap stoles se juntaron con jes s y le contaron todo lo que hab an hecho y lo que hab an ense ado el les dijo venid vosotros aparte a un lugar desierto y descansad un poco porque eran muchos los que iban y ven an de manera que ni aun ten an tiempo para comer y se fueron solos en una barca a un lugar desierto pero muchos los vieron ir y le reconocieron y muchos fueron all a pie desde las ciudades y llegaron antes que ellos y se juntaron a l y sali jes s y vio una gran multitud y tuvo compasi n de ellos porque eran como ovejas que no ten an pastor y comenz a ense arles muchas cosas cuando ya era muy avanzada la hora sus disc pulos se acercaron a l diciendo el lugar es desierto y la hora ya muy avanzada desp delos para que vayan a los campos y aldeas de alrededor y compren pan pues no tienen qu comer respondiendo l les dijo dadles vosotros de comer ellos le dijeron que vayamos y compremos pan por doscientos denarios y les demos de comer el les dijo cu ntos panes ten is id y vedlo y al saberlo dijeron cinco y dos peces y les mand que hiciesen recostar a todos por grupos sobre la hierba verde y se recostaron por grupos de ciento en ciento y de cincuenta en cincuenta entonces tom los cinco panes y los dos peces y levantando los ojos al cielo bendijo y parti los panes y dio a sus disc pulos para que los pusiesen delante y reparti los dos peces entre todos y comieron todos y se saciaron y recogieron de los pedazos doce cestas llenas y de lo que sobr de los peces y los que comieron eran cinco mil hombres
158752 en seguida hizo a sus disc pulos entrar en la barca e ir delante de l a betsaida en la otra ribera entre tanto que l desped a a la multitud y despu s que los hubo despedido se fue al monte a orar y al venir la noche la barca estaba en medio del mar y l solo en tierra y vi ndoles remar con gran fatiga porque el viento les era contrario cerca de la cuarta vigilia de la noche vino a ellos andando sobre el mar y quer a adelant rseles vi ndole ellos andar sobre el mar pensaron que era un fantasma y gritaron porque todos le ve an y se turbaron pero en seguida habl con ellos y les dijo tened nimo yo soy no tem is y subi a ellos en la barca y se calm el viento y ellos se asombraron en gran manera y se maravillaban porque a n no hab an entendido lo de los panes por cuanto estaban endurecidos sus corazones
158753 terminada la traves a vinieron a tierra de genesareth y arribaron a la orilla y saliendo ellos de la barca en seguida la gente le conoci y recorriendo toda la tierra de alrededor comenzaron a traer de todas partes enfermos en lechos a donde o an que estaba y dondequiera que entraba en aldeas ciudades o campos pon an en las calles a los que estaban enfermos y le rogaban que les dejase tocar siquiera el borde de su manto y todos los que le tocaban quedaban sanos
158754 porque ense aba a sus disc pulos y les dec a el hijo del hombre ser entregado en manos de hombres y le matar n pero despu s de muerto resucitar al tercer d a
158755 los disc pulos se asombraron de sus palabras pero jes s respondiendo volvi a decirles hijos cu n dif cil les es entrar en el reino de dios a los que conf an en las riquezas
158756 pero id decid a sus disc pulos y a pedro que l va delante de vosotros a galilea all le ver is como os dijo
158757 y ellos saliendo predicaron en todas partes ayud ndoles el se or y confirmando la palabra con las se ales que la segu an am n
158758 aconteci que estaba jes s orando en un lugar y cuando termin uno de sus disc pulos le dijo se or ens anos a orar como tambi n juan ense a sus disc pulos
158759 as pues cualquiera de vosotros que no renuncia a todo lo que posee no puede ser mi disc pulo
158760 este principio de se ales hizo jes s en can de galilea y manifest su gloria y sus disc pulos creyeron en l
158761 desde entonces muchos de sus disc pulos volvieron atr s y ya no andaban con l
158762 luego puso agua en un lebrillo y comenz a lavar los pies de los disc pulos y a enjugarlos con la toalla con que estaba ce ido
158763 en esto conocer n todos que sois mis disc pulos si tuviereis amor los unos con los otros
158764 fue entonces mar a magdalena para dar a los disc pulos las nuevas de que hab a visto al se or y que l le hab a dicho estas cosas
158765 cuando ya iba amaneciendo se present jes s en la playa mas los disc pulos no sab an que era jes s
158766 en aquellos d as como creciera el n mero de los disc pulos hubo murmuraci n de los griegos contra los hebreos de que las viudas de aqu llos eran desatendidas en la distribuci n diaria
158767 saulo respirando a n amenazas y muerte contra los disc pulos del se or vino al sumo sacerdote
158768 cuando lleg a jerusal n trataba de juntarse con los disc pulos pero todos le ten an miedo no creyendo que fuese disc pulo
158769 y se congregaron all todo un a o con la iglesia y ense aron a mucha gente y a los disc pulos se les llam cristianos por primera vez en antioqu a
158770 su puesto queda sin qui n lo ocupe y su habitaci n queda sin qui n la habite
158771 conviene entonces que elijamos a uno que reemplace a judas y el elegido debe ser de los que estuvieron con nosotros todo el tiempo en que el se or convivi con nosotros desde que fue bautizado por juan bautista hasta que resucit y subi a los cielos
158772 se or t que conoces los corazones de todos mu stranos a cual de estos dos eliges como ap stol en reemplazo de judas
158773 juzguen como nuevos doce patriarcas las doce tribus de israel

158776 t eres sim n hijo de jon s pero en adelante te llamar s pedro
158777 oh egeas si t quisieses conocer este misterio de la cruz y c mo el creador del mundo quiso morir en el madero para salvar al hombre seguramente creer as en l y le adorar as
158778 oh cruz instrumento de salud del alt simo oh cruz signo de victoria de cristo sobre sus enemigos oh cruz plantada en la tierra y que fructificas en el cielo oh nombre de la cruz que abarcas en ti al universo salve cruz que has unido al mundo en toda su extensi n
158779 salve oh cruz preciosa recibe al disc pulo de aquel que en ti estuvo clavado cristo mi maestro
158780 t hermano de pedro obtuviste su misma muerte pues la cruz engendr para el cielo a los que hab ais nacido de una misma carne
158781 hombres religiosos de toda naci n de las que est n debajo del cielo
158782 as que no hab a entre ellos ning n necesitado porque todos los que pose an heredades o casas las vend an y tra an el precio de lo vendido y lo pon an a los pies de los ap stoles y se repart a a cada uno seg n su necesidad entonces jos a quien los ap stoles pusieron por sobrenombre bernab que traducido es hijo de consolaci n levita natural de chipre como ten a una heredad la vendi y trajo el precio y lo puso a los pies de los ap stoles
158783 un buen hombre lleno de fe y del esp ritu santo
158784 separad a pablo y bernab para una tarea que les tengo asignada
158785 es necesario pasar por muchas tribulaciones para entrar en el reino de dios

158787 si quieres ser perfecto ve vende cuanto tienes dalo a los pobres y ven y s gueme
158788 jos el apellidado por los ap stoles bernab que traducido es lo mismo que hijo de la consolaci n levita chipriota de linaje como poseyese un campo lo vendi trajo el dinero y lo puso a los pies de los ap stoles
158789 segregadme a bernab y a pablo para la obra a que los llamo
158790 muchos de los jud os y pros litos adoradores de dios siguieron a pablo y a bernab que les hablaban para persuadirlos que permaneciesen en la gracia de dios
158791 a vosotros os hab amos de hablar primero la palabra de dios mas puesto que la rechaz is y os juzg is indignos de la vida eterna nos volveremos a los gentiles
158792 mientras los disc pulos quedaban llenos de alegr a y del esp ritu santo
158793 el sacerdote del templo de zeus trajo toros enguirnaldados y acompa ado de la muchedumbre quer a ofrecerles en sacrificio
158794 confirmando las almas de los disc pulos y exhort ndoles a permanecer en la fe dici ndoles que por muchas tribulaciones nos es preciso entrar en el reino de dios
158795 su nombre t picamente hebreo significa el se or ha dado su gracia
158796 pasando de all vio a otros dos hermanos jacobo hijo de zebedeo y juan su hermano en la barca con zebedeo su padre que remendaban sus redes y los llam
158797 pasando de all un poco m s adelante vio a jacobo hijo de zebedeo y a juan su hermano tambi n ellos en la barca que remendaban las redes
158798 pasando otra vez jes s en una barca a la otra orilla se reuni alrededor de l una gran multitud y l estaba junto al mar
158799 seis d as despu s jes s tom a pedro a jacobo y a juan y los llev aparte solos a un monte alto y se transfigur delante de ellos
158800 y tom consigo a pedro a jacobo y a juan y comenz a entristecerse y a angustiarse
158801 y se sent en el monte de los olivos frente al templo y pedro jacobo juan y andr s le preguntaron aparte dinos cu ndo ser n estas cosas y qu se al habr cuando todas estas cosas hayan de cumplirse jes s respondi ndoles comenz a decir mirad que nadie os enga e porque vendr n muchos en mi nombre diciendo yo soy el cristo y enga ar n a muchos m s cuando oig is de guerras y de rumores de guerras no os turb is porque es necesario que suceda as pero a n no es el fin porque se levantar naci n contra naci n y reino contra reino y habr terremotos en muchos lugares y habr hambres y alborotos principios de dolores son estos pero mirad por vosotros mismos porque os entregar n a los concilios y en las sinagogas os azotar n y delante de gobernadores y de reyes os llevar n por causa de m para testimonio a ellos y es necesario que el evangelio sea predicado antes a todas las naciones pero cuando os trajeren para entregaros no os preocup is por lo que hab is de decir ni lo pens is sino lo que os fuere dado en aquella hora eso hablad porque no sois vosotros los que habl is sino el esp ritu santo y el hermano entregar a la muerte al hermano y el padre al hijo y se levantar n los hijos contra los padres y los matar n y ser is aborrecidos de todos por causa de mi nombre mas el que persevere hasta el fin ste ser salvo pero cuando ve is la abominaci n desoladora de que habl el profeta daniel puesta donde no debe estar el que lee entienda entonces los que est n en judea huyan a los montes el que est en la azotea no descienda a la casa ni entre para tomar algo de su casa y el que est en el campo no vuelva atr s a tomar su capa mas ay de las que est n encintas y de las que cr en en aquellos d as orad pues que vuestra huida no sea en invierno porque aquellos d as ser n de tribulaci n la cual nunca ha habido desde el principio de la creaci n que dios cre hasta este tiempo ni la habr y si el se or no hubiese acortado aquellos d as nadie ser a salvo mas por causa de los escogidos que l escogi acort aquellos d as entonces si alguno os dijere mirad aqu est el cristo o mirad all est no le cre is porque se levantar n falsos cristos y falsos profetas y har n se ales y prodigios para enga ar si fuese posible aun a los escogidos mas vosotros mirad os lo he dicho todo antes
158802 entonces jes s respondiendo dijo no sab is lo que ped s pod is beber del vaso que yo he de beber y ser bautizados con el bautismo con que yo soy bautizado y ellos le dijeron podemos el les dijo a la verdad de mi vaso beber is y con el bautismo con que yo soy bautizado ser is bautizados pero el sentaros a mi derecha y a mi izquierda no es m o darlo sino a aquellos para quienes est preparado por mi padre
158803 uno a tu derecha y el otro a tu izquierda

158805 en aquel mismo tiempo el rey herodes ech mano a algunos de la iglesia para maltratarles
158806 entonces se le acerc la madre de los hijos de zebedeo con ellos y se puso de rodillas para pedirle algo
158807 por entonces el rey herodes prendi a algunos de la iglesia para maltratarlos hizo morir a espada a santiago hermano de juan

158816 it significantly impairs your ability to stay independent which is what people want
158817 it was something that has kind of been on my mind in general and once i started looking at balance it became very clear it would have applications in that direction
158818 poor balance isnt something you have to accept you can help yourself you can improve balance
158819 what we now have in the culture dish is cells that have the same genetic makeup as the als patient and they are the same cells that are affected by the disease
158820 there is no way we could go to an als patient and take these cells
158821 now we have to figure out whether these motor neurons are able to mature
158822 for these to be useful for drug development we need mature motor neurons
158823 up until now its been impossible to get access to the neurons affected by als and although everyone was excited by the potential of the new technology it was uncertain that we would be able to obtain them from patients skin cells
158824 our paper now shows that we can generate hundreds of millions of motor neurons that are genetically identical to a patients own neurons this will be an immense help as we try to uncover the mechanisms behind this disease and screen for drugs that can prolong life
158825 los pescadores tambi n se entristecer n y har n duelo todos los que echan anzuelo en el r o
158826 he aqu vienen d as sobre vosotros que os llevar en anzuelos y a vuestros descendientes en barquillos de pescador
158827 cortar s con tu cuchillo su cuero o con asta de pescadores su cabeza
158828 y pasando junto a la mar de galilea vio a sim n y a andr s su hermano que echaban la red en la mar porque eran pescadores y les dijo jes s venid en pos de m y har que ser is pescadores de hombres
158829 asimismo el reino de los cielos es semejante a la red que echada en la mar coge toda clase de peces la cual estando llena la sacaron a la orilla y sentados cogieron lo bueno en vasos y lo malo echaron fuera
158830 dios engrandezca a japhet y habite en sus tiendas de sem

158832 alzando sus ojos vio a israel alojado por sus tribus
158833 el arca e israel y jud est n debajo de tiendas
158834 morena soy oh hijas de jerusal n como las caba as de cedar
158835 ensancha el sitio de tu caba a y las cortinas de tus tiendas sean extendidas no seas escasa alarga tus cuerdas y fortifica tus estacas
158836 la tienda de un rabe es su hogar pero la palabra
158837 por fe abrah n habit fue morador de tiendas en la tierra prometida como en tierra ajena con isaac y jacob herederos juntamente de la misma promesa
158838 murieron todos estos sin haber recibido las promesas sino mir ndolas de lejos y crey ndolas y salud ndolas y confesando que eran peregrinos y advenedizos sobre la tierra
158839 cuando edificares casa nueva har s pretil a tu terrado porque no pongas sangre en tu casa si de l cayere alguno
158840 ser n como la hierba de los tejados que se seca antes que crezca
158841 este es un buen ejemplo de la apariencia de hierba sobre los tejados
158842 en las tinieblas miran las casas que de d a para s se alaron no conocen la luz
158843 no os hag is tesoros en la tierra donde la polilla y el or n corrompen y donde ladrones minan y hurtan

158847 y cuando la hubiera hallado junta las amigas y las vecinas

158849 as alumbre vuestra luz debute de los hombres para que vean vuestras obras buenas y glorifiquen a vuestro padre que est en los cielos
158850 y si la hierba del campo que hoy es y ma ana es echada en el horno
158851 qu tienes ahora que toda t te has subido sobre los terrados
158852 lo que hablasteis al o do en las c maras ser pregonado desde los terrados
158853 de ellos que se inclinan sobre los terrados al ej rcito del cielo
158854 subi a la azotea a orar cerca de la hora de sexta
158855 y los que sobre el terrado no desciendan a tomar algo de su casa
158856 mas yo estoy como oliva verde en la casa de dios
158857 plantados en la casa de jehov nuestro dios florecer n
158858 y llegaron a casa de un hombre de bahurim que ten a un pozo en su patio dentro del cual se metieron y tomando la mujer de la casa una manta extendi ndola sobre la boca del pozo y tendi sobre ella el grano trillado y no se penetr el negocio
158859 y estaban en pie los siervos y los ministros que hab an allegado las ascuas porque hac a fr o y calent banse y estaba tambi n con ellos pedro en pie calent ndose
158860 y pondr la llave de la casa de david sobre su hombro
158861 mi amado meti su mano por el agujero de la puerta
158862 y saliendo l a la puerta le vio otra y dijo a los que estaban ah tambi n ste estaba con jes s nazareno
158863 y tocando pedro a la puerta del patio sali una muchacha para escuchar llamada rhode la cual como conoci la voz de pedro de gozo no abri el postigo
158864 ellos subieron al aposento alto que era ya su lugar de reuni n
158865 descubrieron el techo en donde estaba jes s y haciendo apertura bajaron el lecho en que yac a el paral tico
158866 y por el tejado le bajaron con el lecho en medio delante de jes s
158867 dif cilmente se puede uno imaginar que los que llevaban al paral tico hubiesen cavado un agujero a trav s del techo sin hablar de la interrupci n e inconveniencia causadas a aquellos que se encontraban dentro de la casa con dicha operaci n pero tal objeci n no tendr a caso si nos refiri semos no al techo principal de la casa sino al de la galer a cubierta bajo la cual creemos que estaba el se or en tal caso debe haber sido bastante f cil destechar la cubierta de tejas y ladrillos y entonces habiendo hecho el agujero a trav s de las ligazones que soportan las tejas bajar su carga en medio y frente a jes s
158868 saulo respirando a n amenazas y muerte contra los disc pulos del se or vino al sumo sacerdote y le pidi cartas para las sinagogas de damasco a fin de que si hallase algunos hombres o mujeres de este camino los trajese presos a jerusal n mas yendo por el camino aconteci que al llegar cerca de damasco repentinamente le rode un resplandor de luz del cielo y cayendo en tierra oy una voz que le dec a saulo saulo por qu me persigues el dijo qui n eres se or y le dijo yo soy jes s a quien t persigues dura cosa te es dar coces contra el aguij n el temblando y temeroso dijo se or qu quieres que yo haga y el se or le dijo lev ntate y entra en la ciudad y se te dir lo que debes hacer y los hombres que iban con saulo se pararon at nitos oyendo a la verdad la voz m s sin ver a nadie entonces saulo se levant de tierra y abriendo los ojos no ve a a nadie as que llev ndole por la mano le metieron en damasco donde estuvo tres d as sin ver y no comi ni bebi
158869 estas diferencias no pueden en absoluto alterar el hecho el objeto narrado es extremadamente remoto no tratan ni siquiera de las circunstancias que rodearon el milagro sino con las impresiones subjetivas que los compa eros de san pablo recibieron en esas circunstancias
158870 un temperamento nervioso excitable un alma violentamente agitada por las m s terribles dudas una fantas a de lo m s v vido llena de las terribles escenas de persecuci n por un lado y por el otro con la imagen ideal del cristo celeste la proximidad de damasco que implicaba la urgencia de la decisi n la intransigencia que lleva a la soledad el calor cegador y doloros simo del desierto de hecho todo esto combinado produjo un estado de xtasis en los que el alma cree ver las im genes y los conceptos que violentamente la agitan como si fueran fen menos del mundo externo
158871 y cayendo en tierra oy una voz que le dec a saulo saulo por qu me persigues
158872 amigos por qu hac is esto nosotros somos hombre como vosotros que hemos venido a anunciaros que dej is los dioses falsos y os convirt is al dios vivo que ha hecho el cielo la tierra y todo lo que hay en ellos el cual ha permitido en las pasadas generaciones que todas las naciones siguiesen sus caminos sin embargo no ha cesado jam s de dar testimonio de s mismo haciendo el bien mand ndoos desde el cielo lluvias y estaciones fruct feras y saci ndolos de comida y llenando vuestros corazones de felicidad

158874 et si cognovimus secundum carnem christum sed nunc jam novimus
158875 la doctrina del ap stol es en realidad teoc ntrica y no antropoc ntrica lo que solemos llamar metaf sica sustenta para pablo el hecho inmediato y soberano dios como l lo concibe es todo en todos tanto para su raz n como para su coraz n
158876 la ltima palabra de la teolog a paulina es dios todo en todos
158877 no hay diferencia entre jud os y gentiles puesto que todos pecaron y todos necesitan la gloria de dios
158878 a causa de un hombre entr el pecado en el mundo y por el pecado la muerte as que la muerte pas a todos los hombres puesto que todos en l pecaron
158879 todos pecaron cuando ad n pec todos pecaron en y con su pecado
158880 dado que me deleito en la ley de dios seg n el hombre interior pero hay otra ley en mis miembros que lucha contra la ley del esp ritu y me hace cautivo en el pecado
158881 salvar a todos los hombres y los har llegar al conocimiento de la verdad
158882 la escritura concluy bajo el pecado mientras que la promesa por la fe en jesucristo pudo ser dada a los que creen
158883 dios envi a su hijo nacido de mujer bajo la ley para que pudiera redimir al hombre que estaba bajo la ley para que pudiera recibir la adopci n filial
158884 dios envi a su hijo bajo la apariencia de la carne pecadora
158885 dado que en l se realiza la plenitud de la divinidad corporalmente
158886 siendo de forma divina se despoj a s mismo ekenosen eauton de donde kenosis tomando la forma de un siervo
158887 fuimos reconciliados con dios por la muerte de su hijo
158888 es imposible en este pasaje ro 3 25 desembarazarse de la siguiente doble idea
158889 el doble peligro de esta idea es primeramente el querer aplicar al sacrificio de cristo todos los modos de acci n reales o supuestos de los sacrificios imperfectos de la antigua ley y por otro lado el suponer que dios se apiada por una especie de efecto m gico en virtud de este sacrificio donde por el contrario fue l quien tom la iniciativa de la misericordia instituyendo el sacrificio del calvario y dot ndolo de un valor expiatorio
158890 justificados gratuitamente por su gracia por la redenci n en cristo jes s a quien dios puso como sacrificio de propiciaci n mediante la fe en su sangre para la manifestaci n de su justicia por la remisi n de los pecados pasados en la paciencia de dios para manifestar su justicia en el tiempo presente para probar que es justo y que justifica a todo el que cree en cristo jes s
158891 abraham crey a dios y le fue reputado por justicia
158892 justificados por la fe sin el auxilio de la ley
158893 de acuerdo con dios es creado en la justicia y en la santidad
158894 el hombre viejo es crucificado con cristo para que el cuerpo de pecado sea destruido con el fin de que no sirvamos ya m s al pecado
158895 gracias sean dadas a dios porque siendo siervos del pecado hab is obedecido de coraz n a la doctrina en la que hab is sido liberados pero ahora siendo libres del pecado habi ndoos convertido en los siervos de dios ten is el fruto de la santificaci n y en la vida eterna
158896 los muertos que est n en cristo surgir n primero

158900 no se equivoc en nada quien compar el alma de san pablo ameno prado de virtudes y con un espiritual ed n la mayor alabanza que a alguien podemos tributar es reconocer que no hay palabras adecuadas suficientes para ponderar las grandezas y virtudes de su alma

158906 i commend our new attorney general and her staff for the courage fortitude and heart theyve shown in their recent efforts shutting down illegal gambling machines on guam
158907 well see if the notices go out and well act accordingly
158908 the worst is over in the financial crisis or will be very soon
158909 enslaved his conquered enemies and had them build his great wall
158910 why dont we sit down and discuss this like a family
158911 hes made us the laughing stock of the entire world
158912 if you screw this up im going to leave you
158913 from what i saw in this trip to the west bank i would say that if its not already impossible it is so close as to be virtually the same
158914 close to adopting practical measures that will force israel to cease the overflights
158915 he has certainly im sure said things in town halls
158916 since they dont have any new ideas the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me theyre going to try to say that im a risky guy theyre going to try to say well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills and and theyre going to send out nasty emails
158917 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
158918 we hit another low note every day from this campaign
158919 observers from across the country including some prominent republicans are questioning the tone of senator mccains campaign this is not the john mccain americans thought they were seeing
158920 all it take is a little dip in the polls for john mccain to cast aside his values
158921 how bad does john mccain want to avoid talking about real issues
158922 to some extent the appearance of paris hilton and britney spears people complain about it they should just relax and enjoy it
158923 and i dont like to text message because id rather call somebody on the telephone
158924 i do understand the importance of the computer i understand the importance of the blogs
158925 does drive the news it is changing the shape of the news its changing the information age and ive got to stay up with it
158926 but i am forcing myself let me put it this way i am using the computer more and more every day
158927 it doesnt mean that i have to e mail people
158928 constantly showing them to me as the news breaks during the day
158929 i use a computer almost every day i go on different web sites ours and the various media
158930 the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
158931 it looks like they got away with it scot free
158932 and that the so called loyal bushies that they stuffed into these positions will also have gotten away with it and will be there essentially indefinitely protected by civil service protections that they dont deserve

158939 the microsoft negotiations were just the latest example of the negligence by this board

158957 advanced discussions with a party have continued but without agreement to date
158958 we are disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement overnight i think it would have been a good fit
158959 edf are as people know the worlds largest nuclear operator i think it would have been a very sensible way to take forward new nuclear plans in the uk
158960 but the future of new nuclear in the uk doesnt depend on this particular deal
158961 its up to the board now and edf to see if there is any way that this gap can be bridged but i think we are absolutely committed to new nuclear power and if this deal is not able to go through for whatever reason we will be looking at plans to make sure we can continue with our foot on the floor because britain needs these new nuclear power stations
158962 it is time to bring this farcical british energy sales process to an end
158963 the employees at british energy are the best in the world and are more than capable of running the next generation of nuclear energy supply if given the opportunity
158964 the government must act in the interests of the employees and the entire nation it is vital we get the new nuclear power station build programme under way in order to reduce our dependency on expensive gas and oil
158965 if we do not act now this dependency will cripple the economy
158966 the government must force british energy to make available their sites in order that international consortiums can build the next generation of power stations
158967 uk manufacturing can develop and become a global supply chain player for nuclear and clean coal power station new build
158968 that wasnt the view of all of the shareholders and of course the government is only a minority shareholder in this publicly listed company so the board has quite rightly overall responsibility to all of the shareholders to try to find the right way forward
158969 i hope that they can i do remain convinced this is the right deal but its got to be acceptable to the shareholders and those are the discussions that are going on today
158970 oh what tangled webs we weave when at first we do decieve
158971 if alonso moves then there could be drivers with experience available
158972 there are also good new generation red bull drivers and toro rosso is aligned with the new generation ideally we would like to have a young driver next to an experienced one
158973 we also have to see how bourdais develops over the second half of the season
158974 i read in the press that the holden teams have to work a lot harder and weve done that coming into winton
158975 certainly theres more fords up the front at the moment than holdens but theres enough of us up there it only takes one to win
158976 i wouldnt have thought thered be three tenths between first and second tomorrow
158977 the weathers forecast to be changeable again so todays probably good practice for when it counts
158978 today was difficult with the weather constantly changing but we were able to get lots of information with the new tyre at our test circuit we might have been quickest today weve got three tenths but my car performance wasnt exactly there im happy in the wet so were ready for anything tomorrow
158979 but when you lose a couple it puts some extra emphasis on this particular test and thats pretty obvious
158980 since the involvement of this group of coaches weve only lost once two test matches in a row so that puts a bit of extra edge on it a bit of extra stress
158981 theres always a lot of tension every test match that youre involved in particularly the big ones
158982 thats the way it should be i think most people would go through that tension
158983 were very focused to do the best job we can i think people are doing that the teams doing that and thats all we can do
158984 weve just got to make sure that we remain focused on doing that and dont get our attention on other things that dont matter
158985 as to whether were going to be good enough we cant do any more than were doing
158986 weve put in place some policies which we think will work and worked at those particularly hard and i think the guys feel good about that
158987 in my view williams should finish his season with his club in australia and then come to france
158988 i find it funny and bizarre that a player would break his contract in the middle of the season to go somewhere else
158989 there is a rule in the french competition that a player can finish his season in australia and then come to france midway through the season
158990 at a basic level we dont believe anybody should break their contract
158991 we have heard from david about this matter but it is really something for the french authorities
158992 what is striking about mccains sharper edge criticized by several newspapers recently is how it appears to conflict with some of his more high minded talk of the need for civility on the stump today a voter in racine called him on it
158993 obama said critics were trying to paint him as strange and scary
158994 1 well known for some bad quality or deed 2 morally bad shocking
158995 1 having a reputation of the worst kind notoriously evil 2 causing or bringing infamy disgraceful

159005 infelizmente e com pena minha tenho que admitir que sou o maior vendedor no afeganist o vai haver uma crise de venda de livros se algo nos acontecer ou se falirmos
159006 por isso que muito importante conseguir que outros tamb m se envolvam nisto
159007 os livros s o como o mar tem que se mergulhar no mar para apanhar a p rola tem que se ler livros para resolver os problemas do pa s
159008 desta forma um estudante salvava dinheiro e tempo por n o ter que viajar desde kunduz ou takhar at cabul para comprar um livro
159009 claro que o neg cio fazia parte dos meus objectivos mas as pessoas teriam beneficiado mais do projecto

159022 grave concern about the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan and the serious impact on civilians
159023 the number of insurgent attacks bombings and other violent incidents is up by approximately 50 on the same period last year
159024 are mounting an increasingly vigorous systematic terror campaign of threats abductions and executions aimed against members of the civilian population
159025 searches conducted by afghan and international forces have on some occasions involved excessive use of force extra judicial killings destruction of property and or mistreatment of suspects
159026 but we need the continued support of ngos and the international community if we are to prevent further suffering
159027 it is imperative they remain committed to afghanistan the needs of its people cannot be met by the government and the un alone
159028 the first irregularity i would mention is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
159029 the international media continued that media witch hunt so that is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me i believe that this fact seriously jeopardizes the trial itself
159030 our plans have not been dealt a blow candidate spending infringements will be regulated by the police and the courts and not the electoral commission

159063 we feel badly about this but believe that for this to be the best experience for all parties and to ensure appropriate consistency and continuity of the process it would be best to postpone the meeting until the new commissioner is named
159064 weve now written to president monson and asked if another general authority can be designated to meet with us
159065 the reason the august meeting with affirmation was postponed is clearly given in the letter

159122 we learn every day and as such the nff must not relent on its effort towards taking the game of football in the country to greater heights we have recorded achievements in the past but i want to believe that the present board can do more as there are still rooms for improvement there are still a lot of work to be done because in football it is not over until it is over and that is why i think the federation can do more for the upcoming youths in the country and for the game in general

159149 hiv develops resistance very rapidly and once that happens drugs dont work as well as they theoretically should or they stop working altogether
159150 physicians routinely have the patients virus tested for resistance in advance of treatment to help make the appropriate clinical decisions
159151 the focus has been on specific areas of the hiv genome where we expect these resistance conferring mutations to occur
159152 we focus on a particular sequence on an important gene from amino acid 1 to 300 and as such we miss roughly a third of this gene until recently most researchers believed that this hidden area was of little clinical significance
159153 the mechanism about how these mutations could be involved in resistance was not clear however in our paper we present data that explains in considerable detail how these mutations work
159154 the ability to derive als motor neurons through a simple skin biopsy opens the doors to improved drug discovery for the first time researchers will be able to look at als cells under a microscope and see why they die if we can figure out how a persons motor neurons die we will figure out how to save motor neurons
159155 for the first time we have the opportunity to examine cellular and molecular defects in motor neurons and glial cells derived from patients with als and we can now begin drug screens on disease specific classes of human motor neurons
159156 through the work of the jenifer estess laboratory for stem cell research we now can glimpse the new age of als research an age of progress and promise
159157 it has been a privilege to collaborate with kevin eggan and his team and to contribute to this critical step forward we will continue to work hand in hand with harvard researchers and project a l s to exploit the potential of these cells for drug screening

159160 the transition from adolescence to adulthood has been shown to be a time for taking on many negative health behaviors including increases in smoking and alcohol use and decreases in physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption
159161 in this study we were investigating whether tv viewership and recognition of snack advertisements were associated with snack food consumption and the odds of being overweight or obese
159162 given that bacterial vaginosis and hiv infection are both transmitted sexually it is difficult to determine whether associations found are causal or if there is some other reason why women with bv are more likely that others to become infected with hiv
159163 if additional follow up studies show that there was a relationship between bv and the risk of incident hiv infection though then increasing the treatment of bv could be considered for the future prevention of hiv infection
159164 that may be because women in high risk groups have a greater risk of acquiring hiv from causes other than bv this could be helpful information in identifying which populations would be helped most through targeted bacterial vaginosis control measures
159165 they blamed it on everything else under the sun they worked in loud factories they listened to loud music one got hit by a tractor
159166 some people with the mutation have hearing loss in their 40s of the kind we normally see in people a decade or more older
159167 often identifying a gene in individuals who have early onset of a disorder will help explain why the disorder occurs in the general population
159168 in many types of hereditary hearing loss its likely that environmental factors that people can control such as smoking and exposure to noise also can influence how severe the hearing loss is and how early in life it begins
159169 you can have children tested early so they dont have speech or school problems
159170 british medicine is highly respected worldwide because of the training provided and the breadth of experience and clinical expertise of most consultants and gps

159172 we wanted to know whether a drug specific for ppar delta would have the same beneficial effects
159173 genetic engineering in humans commonly known as gene doping when mentioned in connection with athletic performance is certainly feasible but very impractical
159174 we got the expected benefits in lowering fatty acids and blood glucose levels but no effect absolutely none on exercise performance
159175 that led us to consider whether ampk activation was the critical trigger that allowed ppar delta to work
159176 it essentially puts a turbo charge on ppar delta which explains why exercise is so important
159177 thats as much improvement as we get with regular exercise

159183 this upgrade consolidates the gold standards position as a leading voluntary standard at ecofys we have worked hard to improve on the first version cutting back on red tape whilst all the time ensuring that the checks and balances are strengthened
159184 tfs green are long time supporters of the gold standard so were delighted to be sponsoring the new handbook we hope it will make it easier to structure high quality projects that comply and may be awarded the gold standard raising the bar for projects and encouraging premium prices for projects that need and deserve them
159185 it is truly remarkable that the gold standard version 2 continues to be as rigorous in ensuring the integrity of a ghg reduction project while at the same time simplifying and streamlining guidelines to reduce unnecessary transaction costs
159186 given the excessive demand for high quality credits in the voluntary as well as the compliance market first climate is proud to be a main sponsor of such an important and timely initiative from the quality leader in the carbon market
159187 both in the voluntary and in the compliance market the gold standard has been setting the benchmark in terms of sustainability reliability and therefore quality of carbon offset projects the further development and clarification of the guidelines and procedures will guarantee an even more transparent and efficient project cycle and assure the continuing premium character of gs credits

159201 xgnp can either be used as an additive to plastics or by itself it can make a transformational change in the performance of many advanced electronic and energy devices
159202 it can do so because its a nanoparticle with a unique shape made from environmentally benign carbon and it can be made at a very reasonable cost
159203 now that we know how to make this material and how to modify it so that it can be utilized in plastics
159204 our attention is being directed to high end applications where we can really make some substantial changes in the way electronics fuel cells batteries and solar cells perform as a result of using this material
159205 as an engineer we do research with an eye on not only understanding the fundamentals of how things work but also on coming up with solutions to solve important problems facing the world we live in

159207 when manny said hed be willing to play in iraq i thought about it
159208 nashua is a beautiful place its a great city its a much better place to play than in iraq
159209 he said i want to go back to the red sox
159210 i need some production in the middle of the lineup
159211 its in the back of my head but you just focus on getting your stuff right
159212 you want to keep the streak going but you just want to win this game just like any other
159213 coming from summer and going into that your bodys getting beat up but other than that everythings been going good they teach it pretty well so right now our defense is looking sharp we have all our packages in so its looking good
159214 well mix it up with an i wing and a spread formation and things are going well so far
159215 its hard where its not the guys you are used to playing with in high school but its going well
159216 everyones very competitive and it should be a good game
159217 i think i fit in well with what ive seen so far so hopefully well do well
159218 the coaches in the state are very good about getting us those films
159219 i think we made some good decisions regarding the kids on this team but unfortunately we lost a few early and in the last few days as well
159220 our defense is way ahead and offensively our timing is getting better
159221 i always thought i would play about five years and have a couple of kids and retire
159222 im kind of unique i really love the game and i go out and play for fun i think with annika its a lot of hard work every time she tees it up shes expected to win her work ethic is just grind grind work out hit balls
159223 i dont think annika could come out here and finish 15th on the money list and live with herself me im ok with that i enjoy what i do i love playing golf but its not the end of the world for me
159224 i play 16 to 18 tournaments a year and get the rest off
159225 and i like what i do so i just play im not sure that im going to play next year but i have plans to finish out this year and then im going to re evaluate and see but im getting close
159226 i was looking forward to a wonderful day but ive never made as many bogeys as i have the last three months and its driving me crazy
159227 i dont know what to do its so disappointing that i cant post something low it seems like i cant play 18 holes
159228 on the 17th tee i got really mad a bad drive off the tee and i didnt hit a good chip
159229 but the rest i have no complaints i think the first day im not worried
159230 im finally back from the physically unable to perform list and im excited to be out here with my teammates
159231 its fun to get back out here its exciting any time you get a chance to play football with the patriots team to play in the national football league its a tremendous honor i dont take it for granted
159232 its good to be out here today and well see what happens tomorrow and well move forward nothing is promised in the national football league with injuries and all the things that can happen ill probably take it day by day and work hard and get better and see how i can help the team
159233 its funny that you ask that because my workouts have really increased and the passion is still there
159234 if it wasnt i definitely wouldnt be here i would be home with my boys and my little daughter and not on this practice field i would never take an opportunity like this and take it for granted so if i didnt have that same passion that same fire and desire i wouldnt be here
159235 im out here and thats the only thing that matters
159236 im out here and im ready to go im excited about it im flying around out there and im ready for the season
159237 a do i feel like getting up in the morning at 5 30 and working out twice a day doing all of the little things that it takes in order to keep yourself in great shape and b do i want to continue to hit people and fly around and be a part of these meetings and both answers are yes
159238 i still have that passion i still feel pretty good i watched myself on tape and im still moving halfway decent so im excited and coach bill belichick he still wants me to play here my teammates still support me so im excited
159239 it was nice to see him out there yesterday he was out there for all of the spring practices and camp he has a confidence and a presence out there that is special
159240 i am sure everyone on the field not just the defensive backs but all the defensive players the coaches and the offensive players feel that presence and confidence they feel that air that he brings in when we walks on the field
159241 does this cpa appear to be genuinely interested in my business needs
159242 es geht jetzt vor allem darum die notwendigen restrukturierungs und finanzierungsma nahmen schnellstm glich auf den weg zu bringen

159244 wir gehen davon aus dass auch 2009 ein sehr anspruchsvolles jahr mit gro en herausforderungen sein wird
159245 its good you should read it go and buy it
159246 the hard part for me was this derailed into a train wreck so quick so fast and so oddly
159247 you had the buddha zen master guy in spring training reading and life is good dont worry be happy and it just looked like he was poised to have a monster season physically he worked his butt off
159248 at the end of the day youre taking the field with a guy who doesnt want to play with you doesnt want to be there doesnt want to obviously effort wise is just not there and thats disheartening and disappointing
159249 during my years here ive seen how they have mistreated other great players when they didnt want them to try to turn the fans against them
159250 the red sox did the same with guys like nomar garciaparra and pedro martinez and now they do the same with me their goal is to paint me as the bad guy i love boston fans but the red sox dont deserve me im not talking about money mental peace has no price and i dont have peace here
159251 tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing
159252 but the fragments cannot demonstrate the full picture of the spectacular opening ceremony
159253 nobody stopped us when we entered the main stadium on monday chinese officials let us in after we showed our id cards and we shot the rehearsal
159254 the purpose of the broadcast was aimed at heightening enthusiasm toward the beijing olympics by showing south korean viewers the magnificence of the opening ceremony there was no other intention

159256 froh dass es in der volkspartei spd viele meinungen gibt
159257 es hat doch ohnehin seit monaten niemand mehr geglaubt dass wolfgang clement spd mitglied ist da w rde es auch keinen berraschen wenn er es nicht mehr ist wer sich so unsolidarisch verh lt muss mit einer solchen entscheidung rechnen
159258 wir machen alle fehler wer ohne s nde ist werfe den ersten stein
159259 wahlen gewinnen wir nur gemeinsam wolfgang clement geh rt genauso zur spd wie andrea nahles und hermann scheer
159260 die spd tut sich damit berhaupt keinen gefallen weil wolfgang clement f r eine bestimmte politische richtung in der spd steht
159261 sein rauswurf w re ein symbol daf r dass diejenigen die einen n chternen realistischen wirtschaftsfreundlichen kurs vertreten in der spd keine politische heimat mehr haben
159262 was seine wirtschafts und ordnungspolitischen vorstellungen angeht gibt es viele bereinstimmungen mit der union das ist richtig aber ob sein herz jetzt f r die union schl gt das muss herr clement selbst entscheiden
159263 so wichtig ist wolfgang clement nicht mehr dass wir wochenlang ber ihn streiten sollten

159270 andy marinos sa rugbys national teams manager sat down with all the players before we returned to sa especially those who we released to their provinces and said they should be in contact with the doctor
159271 we even got reports from the doctor we spoke to him and asked why he didnt play in the currie cup last week and he said it was precautionary this is where he belongs this is where we think he can show his talents the best
159272 it makes it easier for us to keep a group of 22 together for several reasons
159273 if we need the other players the longest flight to where we are would be two hours this way we would know what form they are in and they would get some currie cup game time
159274 i urge you to be bold and courageous in identifying the problems and recommend the way forward the national universities commission on its part will redouble its efforts at ensuring that in a little while meaningful progress is made in sporting activities and facilities in the universities
159275 we have been close on a number of occasions but this time it is an absolute must win situation
159276 the guys are really motivated for this one it took the blue bulls three years to build at least were creating the opportunities
159277 every team is competitive this season even the smaller unions so we are expecting a tough match
159278 there are a whole lot of talented youngsters at the valke and rudy joubert valke coach has done well to turn the team into a competitive outfit
159279 full of whites and indians who dont understand transformation and lack vision
159280 im happy we had fairly good frank constructive discussions as the statement indicates the explanation that was given was acceptable to me
159281 i was not wrong the apartheid setup before 1994 was whites indians coloureds and blacks when you deal with the transformation of that setup you say have our people been accorded enough transformation that will allow them to go up on the upper level if it is not the case you put it in that context and say it has not been transformed
159282 that would be a totally incorrect assumption a letter was dispatched by myself to komphela to co ordinate this meeting that is a fact and any reading other than that is mischievous and totally irresponsible
159283 i have an obligation to meet moss mashishi as somebody who deals with sports in this country there was no political pressure it was his own request to say lets meet and discuss this matter
159284 id want someone to find out what happened to me i think estelles kids deserve to know i dont want them to get away with what they think they got away with
159285 i understood what was going on and she acted up
159286 she took her medication during pill call she was thrown in there and they dont know how to deal with people who may be manic depressive or sick
159287 the woman had health issues and had defecated on herself
159288 she was with us for a couple of days i watched as the guards came and dragged her out and kicked her with steel toe boots
159289 more broadly with respect to the criminal case cca has cooperated fully in the investigation and will continue to do so
159290 on all other matters we defer to the office of the district attorney
159291 none of those details have ever come out who was involved and the circumstances around her murder its a good minor victory now but its great that were moving in that direction
159292 i would dearly love to tell ms richardsons family who killed her and under what circumstances im not going anywhere i hope to do that
159293 i cant wait to complete all the signing formality when we get back to england
159294 i played a game last saturday in portsmouth colours because i am still a player of the club and the deal is finally sealed
159295 i know the club has its own contract policy but we just had to sort out some other things in the contract
159296 but with what we did together last season i still think theres a lot more to come
159297 i have repeatedly said it that i love to play for the club i enjoy my relationship with the manager
159298 we saw the fields and most of us are just sitting at home cooking washing and looking after our husbands and children so we decided to get together and start to play we also need to have some fun and the exercise is good for us
159299 these get togethers let us forget the problems at home and allow us to have some fun
159300 i am alarmed and concerned that if nothing is done to check these excesses our football will die flatly
159301 is it not possible for the federal government and national assembly to enact a law stopping or minimizing showing foreign football so as to project our local league
159302 i was so angry one day that i called my children to mention the players of wikki tourists and they could not name up to five it is a shame it is embarrassing it is humiliating
159303 we have to do something to save our football i believe that too much airing of foreign leagues on our television is not helping

159325 we recently developed routines which mean that you a council employee delegate the responsibility for your inbox when you go on holiday
159326 if you consider your council work emails to be private mail then maybe you need to reconsider

159328 this was a vicious premeditated and sustained attack which was totally unprovoked
159329 i am unable to accept there was no premeditation on the part of ralph

159331 furthermore i am unable to accept the submission that there was in the case of this applicant an absence of intention to kill
159332 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy
159333 over a period of some months going back to the stabbing in norwich road a year or so ago there have been concerns in the community about an element of people who are intent on causing violent disorder mainly alcohol fuelled
159334 we felt it was time we put our pod in this area so people could come and talk to us in confidence and we can show and reassure traders and residents we are listening to their concerns
159335 ultimately what we all want is for norwich road to be a vibrant diverse area of town where people feel safe coming to use and celebrate in its diversity
159336 we are reminding people that ipswich is covered by a designated public places order which can restrict people drinking in public
159337 people who abuse the way they drink in public are going to be arrested and dealt with quite firmly
159338 we want to make sure that the mix is able to co exist and flourish together
159339 we have to work with community leaders to ensure they are aware of whats going on and are able to support us and for us to support them
159340 our key message is about promoting alternative lifestyles to using drugs
159341 if you are using cannabis you are not in yourself and not really living
159342 we are providing information to ensure people are able to make an informed choice
159343 there are lots of activities on offer a whole summer of activities planned for young people
159344 the great thing about the project is over the three years we have been doing it we have created debate allowing people to come down here and have an opinion
159345 we give legal advice and health information about cannabis but do not have a particular line on it
159346 in the second quarter demand for oil remained robust driven by continued growth in asia and the middle east and despite signs of a slowdown in the atlantic basin

159354 his leadership has been instrumental in the county executives effort to run county government like a business certainly johns track record of success will be a key factor when the county executive reviews his appointment this fall
159355 within 24 hours of receiving a complaint from mrs fanti i turned the complaint over to eeo and the county attorneys office for investigation
159356 as a result of that investigation mr murphy was suspended for one week this was the first time i had received a specific complaint from mrs fanti regarding harassment

159362 we all make mistakes im not a judgmental person i may not agree but im not going to judge you for it because we all gotta be accountable and we all gotta take responsibility for the choices that we make
159363 but be that as it may im not going to stop being his friend because he made a mistake i think thats when you need your friends the most when you have made a mistake

159375 on creating of the court tribunal for investigation of crimes of alyaksandr lukashenkas regime
159376 a political moment is unfavourable now osce pace and other international institutions hope for liberalisation of the regime they hope something will change in belarus after the election it will be cleared out that is an illusion and an idea of public or international tribunal will become topical again
159377 my action was dictated by a fact that nothing except for political statements of the authorities was made to make the election process more democratic
159378 i call to oppress the current cynicism and impudence of the authorities that are going to deceive and disunite the belarusian society
159379 only phased sanctions can make lukashenka solve an issue of political prisoners
159380 for that matter i am so sick and tired of the judges not all being familiar with every song that is performed each week on the show
159381 ill play it by myself on guitar and you guys come in halfway through
159382 and here is david cook performing a chris cornell version of michael jacksons billie jean
159383 i walked into this competition with no expectations and im walking out with out any
159384 my music teacher in the second grade made me sing in a christmas pageant
159385 and now im here the rides been pretty nuts you couldnt write this
159386 i dont think anyone realizes how much work we put into this
159387 hes a great guy humble and down to earth people chose me to stand beside him that was an honor
159388 he has more talent at his age than id know what to do with at 25
159389 they were afraid david crosby was going to call me during rehearsal so they took my phone away
159390 everyone here starts off at a certain place and they get better
159391 if youre going to steal my man im going to steal your song
159392 this kind of music could definitely suit your voice you could make an album out of it i dont know if that was a stellar performance for me there were some pitch problems and sometimes you rushed the music a little bit but it was alright
159393 whats great about you is that youre consistent your are who you are you have an emotional connection with each song that you pick and i think thats what record companies and executive want you are brooke white excellent and wonderful
159394 i totally disagree with paula because i think what was lacking on that song was any emotion it looked like you were busking your way through the song i thought all of you looked very odd together as a group it wasnt one of your better performances i wasnt that crazy about it
159395 you sang it well enough and i liked the ensemble touch of adding an intimate band around you but your performance came off as safe and boring for me brooke and im going to have to agree with simon in that i didnt really feel anything from you on that one you have the potential of being a real breakout talent on this show it just didnt happen tonight it wasnt bad it was good just not great
159396 you know what i love that youve been doing the past couple of weeks youre a rocker but youve been showing that youve got this unbelievable range i liked how you went into the falsetto there you made your own arrangement which was very cool and once again another hot consistent performance
159397 i like your haircut let me tell you something ive never heard a guy do that song and it was fantastic hearing you do that going into your false with strength it shows how well rounded you are as an artist
159398 im not going to say it was as good as last week because it wasnt but if you can make a song about sparrows good which actually you did congratulations
159399 this was as weve come to expect from you which is good you didnt slip at all in the quality of your performances as others have done you didnt reach new heights or blow me away but your voice is a real find and a real treasure this year
159400 i wasnt jumping up and down but i wasnt mad at you either it was alright you showed some signs of strength right there and conviction i thought it was a pretty good performance i would say six and a half out of ten
159401 im very proud of you because i was a little worried that you werent going to connect but i think that you really had a great minute and thirty seconds and you really connected with the audience and you were having fun
159402 look were not going to remember this in ten years time are we it was cute you sang it quite well but overall i thought it was forgettable and i thought it was very reminiscent of something you would see and hear on a cruise ship if you want my honest opinion
159403 youre starting to come out of that little shell are you really that shy youve got this big old voice trapped in that tiny little body and tiny little personality i know theres more to you than what we see on that stage you just need to find that confidence and comfort in yourself
159404 i thought it started a little bit rough for me but by the middle of the song i thought you picked it up i thought yeah this is kind of cool you worked it out
159405 this was one of your strongest performances you seemed so comfortable you let go your voice sounded so strong and rich and you were confident it was great i loved it
159406 this is the point where i lose my season pass to dollywood because i didnt like that at all it sounded like the same song as before referring to ramieles song simon probably doesnt know any of dollys songs i didnt think you sang it particularly well i dont think this kind of music suits you well if this had been the first time id seen you or heard you i wouldnt get it sorry
159407 well i thought it was better than that i agree with paula that this was one of your stronger performances its not always about how familiar the song is youre singing but what you bring to it and youve gained tremendous confidence on that stage was it your best no but youre growing and getting better
159408 i do believe that that will probably be one of the better performances of the night nice job
159409 carly that was glorious you are such an amazing talent you are beautiful that voice of yours oh my god and you look great
159410 i thought it was good i dont think it was great i also think that youve got to have a word with whoevers dressing you at the moment i think at this stage without being rude youve got to start looking more like a star and im not seeing that progression at the moment
159411 the irony of simon giving wardrobe critique just sells itself what can you add to that i thought you had a beautifully controlled performance i think youve kind of fallen into the middle of the pack in past weeks but that performance right there should remind the people at home why youre here and how good you can be
159412 david archuleta is back tonight and i stand corrected that was the best performance of the night right there
159413 you have an amazing tone in your voice youre strong you have a beautiful aura about you youre just glorious
159414 i had issues with your choice of song last week this week absolutely on the money
159415 that was a great performance for you david you hit a rocky patch a bit there but you seem to have righted yourself this week this song and style definitely suited you
159416 country music is definitely your wheelhouse and i think you gave a very nice performance this is kind of the kristy lee week
159417 you look stunning tonight you just gave a beautiful performance i think this was your best performance
159418 i totally disagree i thought last week was your best performance and i thought this was pleasant but forgettable
159419 i knew that this would be a good week for you because this is the kind of music you can sing and if this were country idol id be praising you as a contestant but its not and i know as soon as you cant sing something country youre going to go back to being the girl whos just way out of her league on that stage or maybe youll grow as a performer in the meantime and surprise us all but im sure well see you next week
159420 you took on the biggest tiger of the night and i think you did pretty good its still hard for me to hear anyone else sing that song it was alright
159421 you look beautiful that colors gorgeous on you lets talk about your voice your voice has like a velvety tone thats it for you and i just think youre growing and growing and growing and youre connecting with the audience so much more and i love it
159422 you forget what a brilliant song writer dolly parton is because this is one of the best pop songs ever written i almost wish you hadnt got it in a strange way the first part was good the second part as i had a feeling unfortunately paled by comparison to the whitney version i dont even know if it helped you that much it was a good it wasnt a fantastic version of the song
159423 you keep on bring it up every week a notch dude that was a blazing hot performance nice job
159424 i just want to say one thing youre a star a rock star a blues star and you look gorgeous
159425 i think this is the best i have heard you sing throughout the competition
159426 far and away not only your best performance to date but the best performance of the night as well great job
159427 if you could succeed at any other talent what would it be and why
159428 is there a song you hope to sing on the tour this summer
159429 why do you feel it necessary to apologize after a negative critique
159430 the one thing i think might hurt him is his lack of power behind his voice and i think that it might have something to do with him being a stoner he sounds and looks like he smokes weed and i am not just saying that because of his dreds hes very mellow sounds just like a stoner has short breaths which would indicate a smokers lungs and his eyes were very glassy and red
159431 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
159432 well doctor what have we got a republic or monarchy
159433 d emocracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths
159434 weve used up our stupid quotient it is time to get it right
159435 treat every person who presents himself or herself to you as a potential leader with the utmost suspicion
159436 many people are working hard right now to orchestrate your choice of leaders they are employing sophisticated psychological techniques
159437 why have i left my job it was my decision everything has its beginning and end i dont know where i will work i am at disposal of the city internal affaires department i have some serious problems with health im not kidding i am at hospital of the ministry of internal affaires now i have problems with back bone knees blood pressure its not surprising work is nervous i repeat i was my decision nobody pressed upon me i am not a man that can be pressed on i can just say that my wife is glad
159438 unfortunately prosecutors and taxation bodies are not interested in illegal arms supplies
159439 lukashenka is a brutal dictator i believe america must stand up to dictators
159440 they intend to solve organizational matters deal with issues of security and logistics
159441 of course i look i will never vote for a candidate from the bpf i remember times their first leader zyanon paznyak when i saw him at sessions i became so frightened i felt soul chilling terror what a disgusting feeling that is why everything connected with the belarusian popular front is unacceptable for me
159442 appearance is of great importance for a candidate it is the first rule that is still active secondly it is cv people like military men young people and male candidates they also like doctors and teachers in other words clerisy governmental officials are not very popular people like investigators prosecutors judges in other words lawyers on high posts journalists have good reputation the same as actors though we have just one actor in the parliament davydzka a person who has successful career should run for parliament in preretirement age otherwise he or she will spoil their career i am astonished at people who are good professionals but run for mps maybe they have become tired of their jobs
159443 it is possible though i am totally against maybe books newspaper voting ballots will disappear but will it bring joy is internet shopping can be compared with normal shopping election is a ritual visiting of a voting station bar concert and so on they are democratic rituals they make people interested in state affaires maybe we will introduce this system one day but its too early now to speak about it moreover theres a danger of human factor hackers break into cia systems what if they break into the system and change results of elections
159444 from the one hand yes it is necessary some like it hot
159445 our state gets usd 600 for 80 per cent stake
159446 will invest actively and aggressively usd 400 in our network
159447 we think this deal is profitable both for turkcell and belarus
159448 i believe that aggravation of competition at market is for the good of the market and customers
159449 using turkcells experience and investment resources best will make more dynamic progress
159450 the market is already shared but there is still a resource of 1 million subscribers
159451 in my view future competition will be deal not with drawing over of customers but with services buildup by using of new technologies and new services
159452 we have come as good partners we would like to cooperate to make best one of the best companies in the world
159453 we think belarus has rather high potential in economy and technology we are happy to work with belarus and think that the agreement signed today is a step forward to more fruitful cooperation between belarus and turkey
159454 unfortunately prosecutors and taxation bodies are not interested in illegal arms supplies
159455 it looks as if i became a victim of a joke
159456 the belarusian euro atlantic association founded by anatol maisenya was closed down by the ministry of justice 9 or 10 years ago but destroyed in the last century organisation still exists for the taxation bodies it is a mixture of absurd and unprofessionalism
159457 i have no objections to threefold or tenfold control unfortunately prosecutors and taxation bodies are not interested in illegal arms supplies
159458 a man who phoned said he was a kgb officer but didnt say his name moreover he asked how he could find youth activists uladzimir syarheyeu and yahor babrou they will be called for questioning too
159459 everyone wanted to ask yarmoshyna when will you stop lying
159460 most participants of the conference asked the same question when will you stop lying
159461 are you not ashamed to lie constantly georgy moscow i dont have this habit

159478 campaign and honestly my first thought was is this purely pr without real management commitment and substance behind it
159479 put your hand on a hot stove for a minute and it seems like an hour sit with a pretty girl for an hour and it seems like a minute thats relativity
159480 oh yeah that melinda doolittle sure can sing shell be in the finals for sure dont cha know
159481 yeah no offense but we do have much better hook ups
159482 some are taking this opportunity to assuage their own egos by claiming that they werent surprised at all
159483 the leitch scenario of a substantial increase in demand for highly skilled people driven by employers seeking to be world class was seen as at best a partial guide to the future and at worst positively misleading all the evidence was that most uk employers were poor at investing in people and that demand for high level skills was driven mainly by innovation on which uk employers had a similarly poor record
159484 the publicly funded sector proves less attractive to students and employers than the private sector leading to unfilled funded places and a small number of elite institutions seek to secede from the publicly funded sector
159485 private providers cherry picking lucrative vocational provision the take over of failing institutions by the private sector and extreme stratification of the higher education system p 12 including a small group of elite institutions with high fees strong research and significantnumbers ofinternational students

159487 i believe this self representation business is a sham i suspect some big money organization or a wealthy benefactor is providing the finances for this obscene abuse of the legal system and the us constitutions separation of church and state tradition are christians really going to allow some gay activist and a black robed lawyer decide how the bible is written
159488 the intent of the publisher was to design a religious sacred document to reflect an individual opinion or a groups conclusion to cause me or anyone who is a homosexual to endure verbal abuse discrimination episodes of hate and physical violence including murder
159489 this whole lawsuit is making a mockery of the holy bible and a blatant attempt by the homosexual community to away the rights of bible believing christians in the united states past cases against christians and their beliefs has shown that court actions infringing on their beliefs and practices is even easier than taking away candy from a baby
159490 my fear is that christians bishops pastors and church goers will silently accept the decision of a black robed lawyer who may or may not have his own religious agenda too often religious leaders have failed to motivate their churches to take action when their rights are being violated by oppressive anti religious forces inside and outside our government
159491 zondervan doesnt translate the bible or own the copyright for any of the translations instead our company relies on the scholarly judgment of credible translation committees
159492 has some very genuine concerns about the nature and efficacy of the plaintiffs claims
159493 this case just may go a lot further than it deserves thanks to a liberal judge who believes his word is sacrosanct
159494 were an international christian communications company with a heart for helping people find and follow jesus christ by inspiring them with relevant biblical and spiritual resources we do this through our best selling award winning and life changing products
159495 if people believe this lawsuit will disappear they are sadly mistaken judge cook is considered an activist judge who has a personal agenda when it comes to so called discrimination cases and the homosexual plaintiff against zondervan and thomas nelson is claiming the bible discriminates against gays and lesbians this case is not going away any time soon

159510 i wonder if you simply have to be in the right circumstance to find facebook to be useful from a professional perspective
159511 the fact prices dont seem able to go much below 8 000 a tonne is interesting
159512 wed normally see upwards of 100 000 tonnes of copper hitting warehouses over the summer and it just hasnt happened the reality is theres not much copper out there with most producers struggling to hit production targets
159513 were at the stage where weve seen a large spike in lead prices as stocks moved quickly from about 100 000 to 90 000 tonnes and now were seeing a slight shift in psychology as stocks start to come back in
159514 i would suspect that we will see gold staying around these levels until the data comes out
159515 the u s labour market report often leads to wide swings
159516 the fear of inflation isnt quite as prominent as it was two months ago
159517 people are looking at the global economic outlook and it appears to be more controlled now

159521 increased unemployment typically the acquired company suffers severe headcount cuts in mergers
159522 authors self package their book entirely on their own authors distribute digital copies of their books for free to attract readers and to identify a market they use self distribution tools to sell as many books as they can
159523 you said you can still hear the sound of your grandfather opening an 8 ounce bottle of coca cola tell me more about how that made you feel
159524 long term trends in personal given name frequencies in the uk
159525 although no one disputes the lengthening of the tail clearly more obscure products are being made available for purchase every day the tail is likely to be extremely flat and populated by titles that are mostly a diversion for consumers whose appetite for true blockbusters continues to grow
159526 one percent of a million is still 10 000 equal to the entire music inventory of a typical wal mart store
159527 the concentration of sales around the blockbusters is not as strong as rhapsody but its still substantial
159528 customers give lower ratings to obscure titles it is a myth that obscure books films and songs are treasured what consumers buy in internet channels is much the same as what they have always bought
159529 there is no segment with a particular taste for the obscure rather customers with a large capacity for content venture into the tail
159530 if we just had more platinum records wed make more money
159531 that it would be imprudent for companies to upend traditional practice and focus on the demand for obscure products
159532 when producing niche goods for the tail end of the distribution keep costs as low as possible
159533 strictly manage the costs of offering products that will rarely sell
159534 do we want infinite choice or do we prefer to pick up on the likes and dislikes of others in forming our own tastes
159535 cementing the prominence of a small number of cultural favorites
159536 my findings suggest it would be imprudent for companies to upend traditional practice and focus the demand for obscure products the data shows how difficult it is to profit from the tail
159537 there is no segment with a particular taste for the obscure
159538 the whole point of long tail theory is that adding 9 million obscure titles to a digital catalog has negligible marginal costs so any incremental sales would be profitable elberses ill conceived analysis completely missed this point
159539 how can the investment fixed costs in production and marketing of one of these products ever be covered by such low volumes

159541 its not having a particularly damaging impact on our business because weve decided to move forward with at least a number of our productions and until such time as we feel thats not prudent were going to continue to basically approach our business in that way

159543 every course in king of clubs is in many ways like a puzzle game with multiple routes a generous helping of moving obstacles and the potential for some outrageous and intricate hole in ones and even a hole in none
159544 its always about balance theres always a balance and harmony between life and death and beauty yet they evoke certain feelings and open up suggestions and arguments between the elements i want the beauty to draw the viewer in the colour the surface the narrative between the elements but also the juxtapositioning of the elements to create a fresh evocative energy be it childlike or sinister or both

159547 the amendment includes language requiring institutions to make available the development of plans to detect and prevent unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material on the institution of higher educations information technology system
159548 the conferees have combined elements from both bills to require institutions to advise students about this issue and to certify that all institutions have plans to combat and reduce illegal peer to peer file sharing
159549 we work closely with leaders in the higher education community because we both have a stake in ensuring that intellectual property continues to be a strong vibrant part of our nations economy
159550 by including these important provisions in the higher education act congress is sending a strong message that intellectual property is worth protecting
159551 there was some early uproar when facebook first permitted applications about some of the music sharing apps
159552 what ultimately happened then was that the music sharing apps very rapidly were tweaked so that people werent doing any actual file sharing
159553 hasbro certainly couldve saber rattled and pushed the issue with facebook
159554 particularly under the grokster decision from a few years back facebook has to be very careful even if its getting indemnity from the people who are putting applications on the site that indemnity might not amount to much if theres very little there to back it up
159555 in fact in last weeks f8 conference announcement they said they are trying to award and sort out the good applications versus the not so good ones
159556 its posturing but its the way that they are ensuring that theyre not in bed with their application makers for this purpose
159557 strive s to work with developers to correct any issues we discover but when necessary we will act quickly to correct problems and ensure a safe and high quality facebook platform experience for all
159558 i think that this is a questionable area of intellectual property law and its not clear cut
159559 when things arent clear cut you dont necessarily go and cut off peoples access to platforms
159560 the thing is theres 400 000 developers using facebooks platform and theyre trying to find ways to be successful and that means copying games that are going to work
159561 theyre clearly trying to segment quality apps that help the user experience versus ones that dont
159562 automated toolkits obfuscation and the prevalence of unpatched browsers and plug ins
159563 if you dont make the problems public the companies dont fix them and the consumers buy shoddy stuff
159564 the concept of responsible disclosure is well and good for new locks that havent hit the market yet but that doesnt help you when the lock is already embedded in millions of facilities theyre not going to fix them
159565 how does it help the consumer not to tell them that there is a vulnerability
159566 medeco customers have a right to know whether their locks can be compromised
159567 we believe that lock picking obviously is an illicit activity even if its a sport we frown on all of that even if its for fun
159568 as new technologies have become available that is what spurred product innovation and that spurs development of new standards
159569 our responsibility is to make changes when we see a change in the state of the art
159570 everybody has some responsibility to not disclose things that can hurt people and that people dont have power over changing
159571 is it a known vulnerability if people dont know about it
159572 im not sure you need to worry about it unless people are out there demonstrating it and showing how to do it
159573 the assumption is that the criminals dont know about it
159574 criminals know how to pick locks the secrecy just hides the truth from the consumer
159575 the goal is to make security better as soon as its not responsible to do research the bad guys win
159576 the lock picking industry doesnt get this because theyre basically still a guild a secret knowledge kind of field whereas computer security is always built on open knowledge
159577 there have been insecurities discovered by computer people turned locksmiths that have existed for hundreds of years
159578 let them make their security assessments based on how secure they are told the locks are

159584 our drivers are highly qualified and experienced in driving inside the tarmac the blame lies with shiva who came in the way of the bus
159585 we are in no way connected to the accident the driver and the vehicle belong to an agency who are licensed to operate vehicles inside the airport the airline should not be held responsible for no fault of its
159586 on an average we used to book around 70 passengers for the evening flight but ever since the change in time of the air india flight the average booking has gone down to 40
159587 it will happen soon perhaps over the next three to four months

159589 forgive me for being cynical but i dont believe mobileme is working properly for one second thank god i wasnt one of the 1 did apple get the enron accountants to come up with that figure who got totally screwed on email but i have had all the other woes people have reported over the past few weeks
159590 it simply stopped delivering about 50 of my messages for about two hours theyve never turned up today after the damn thing is supposed to be working i had a 30 minute period a few hours ago where mail kept demanding my password and wouldnt sign in to my imap internet message access protocol account
159591 mobileme has been working perfectly fine for me for the past week or more
159592 syncing between home the mobileme cloud and my work machine is dead
159593 i keep getting inconsistent data despite continually resetting removing restarting mobile me and sync over a number of days im hoping for a second free month from apple for this
159594 every type of publicity has some effect so how big a deal it is its not the end of the universe but its not helpful
159595 in terms of it being expected what you have to look at is apple has a larger and larger footprint in the market and many of its customers are new to computers and as it acquires more consumers its getting the less sophisticated types who dont know the things like on the first day of the service there will be lots of calls and the servers will be overtaxed sophisticated users will tend to know this but the newbies will complain and thatll create bad press
159596 this is the first stumble that apple has made in a pretty long while
159597 i feel that since coo tim cook arrived apple has been executing uncommonly well it could be that apple is seeing some of the limits of growth
159598 as long as nvidia manages good operations and improves in these areas theyve got a stunning range of products for many industries gaming gpus graphic processing units chipsets for pc and mac open gl has always been their strength so open gl or maybe open gl es plays to their advantage were talking physics physx which will probably be integrated into open cl cuda etc
159599 in the desktop portable and even mobile space nvidia has a lot to offer apple as long as quality control is maintained
159600 i dont know much about it but isnt that the point of android that its open source if they want an open source cell phone why dont they just use that
159601 oh right they think they are entitled to apples hardware
159602 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple thing but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups youd actually save just as much
159603 but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling
159604 but that ad diminishes him and makes him look silly
159605 the theme of the gala will focus on celebrating diversity and promoting cultural awareness
159606 surrogates and high profile supporters have their place in the campaign
159607 they can help draw crowds raise money and communicate enthusiasm for the campaign like every other asset they need to be leveraged carefully
159608 celebrities are coming onboard because theyre excited about obama like the rest of america
159609 anyone who knows and listens to barack obama doesnt think hes empty headed
159610 with jet airways 21 day advance purchase fares more and more passengers will get to enjoy the airlines world class service at attractive fares on several domestic routes adding up to unbeatable value

159612 we cannot think of a better way to celebrate the life and legacy of this great son of the african soil
159613 were kind of in the middle of the storm right now
159614 the iphone really lit the fire and now everyone is trying to catch up with their own versions
159615 i feel like galileo when he was viewed with skepticism on demonstrating that the earth revolved around the sun
159616 what we realized is that you cant offer advertisers and agencies the level of integration and personalization theyre after when an independent ad rep is handing things
159617 as people get smarter about ad networks theyre going to realize their limitations and that if you want to really make brands shine you have to do it yourself
159618 it was multiyear deal but it had clauses which we triggered
159619 we knew wed do this one day but definitely not this early
159620 our sales team saw how limited we were by the partnership and they were all over me to sell on our own
159621 the response weve been getting from agencies over the last two weeks has been amazing
159622 the level of integration were pursing is really in line with what agencies are pitching to clients
159623 they were curious about what the online versus tv audience would be like
159624 there was this perception that the users of a social news site and youtube were a fairly young bunch and the traditional pbs audience skews a little older
159625 the pilot didnt get a green light but the data surprised people the experiment was so informative that i dont think it will be long before someone at pbs or another organization tries to develop a hybrid on and offline social news program
159626 theres a really negative perception of people in the south particularly of those in the appalachian region
159627 we had to show them that we werent going to portray them negatively and that the clips could actually help attract more local tourism
159628 we were able to say to the bethabara park museum this is your target market
159629 these are the people who you solicit donations from and that youd like to use your educational programs and thats why you should let us film
159630 i would like to thank sam for his many years of sterling service as independent non executive director on sasols board and many of our board committees
159631 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy
159632 we now expect that the pretax return on sales for the year to be at least 4 percent
159633 the market is selling off because of the weak economic numbers out of the u s
159634 growth and oil demand is slowing in the u s europe and japan and its too optimistic to think emerging market demand will compensate for that
159635 the overall momentum on crude oil has clearly changed from the dynamics of the first half of the year
159636 prices will likely correct over the next six months to the 100 to 110 range
159637 there arent enough fundamental factors right now pushing prices higher
159638 we believe that schlitz is if not the one of most iconic brands of the 20th century
159639 and theres still a lot of people who have very positive residual memories about their experience for many of them it was the first beer they drank and we wanted to give it back to those consumers
159640 for many years the product was associated with happy times especially to people my age
159641 as we all know the world is not the best it can be today we used to think those were hard times and when we look back on them those were the good old days
159642 they decided not to pull their product off the shelf
159643 they decided to weather the storm and sell that product thats the worst possible mistake they could have made
159644 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the u s economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our u s operations
159645 this new partnership with daimler financial services is a unique opportunity to bridge a gap between two cities where the company has a presence and the art scenes are so vibrant were excited about the possibilities of how we can further expand the changing cities concept

159650 we are surprised and disappointed with this action especially given that sugammadex received a unanimous recommendation for approval by the fda advisory committee on anesthetics and life support in march of this year

159659 lets be clear the administrations cuts will seriously hurt the most vulnerable the terminally ill
159660 by issuing this rule cms is taking an end run around congress and its longstanding role protecting hospice
159661 the governments reason for its decision that would effectively cut rates the need to save money simply isnt true
159662 research has shown that hospice saves the medicare system money is highly rated by family members of hospice patients and enables the patient to die at home in most cases
159663 this rule defies logic and will have a direct negative impact on care at the bedside
159664 congress should intervene to stop the administrations cut to hospice care before the rule goes into effect
159665 it is in our nations fiscal and moral interest that high quality hospice care remains an option for all who need these unique services and support
159666 we are pleased with our first quarter results and believe that we are on track to meet our targets for the full fiscal year although we anticipate that macro economic conditions will continue to be difficult during the foreseeable future we feel that our products brands and services provide a compelling value proposition to our customers content providers and the consumer i am excited about funimations prospects with their content additions that will solidify this fiscal year and provide strong growth impetus for next year i am particularly pleased with bcis management and their commitment to significantly improving this divisions results for the year

159668 caraustars operating results before restructuring costs were positive for the quarter

159675 we remain fully committed to echelon and convinced that it will produce long term sustainable growth for our company in the years to come we look forward to resuming construction as soon as we are able to do so
159676 during the second quarter we continued to see the same economic factors at work that were present in the first quarter consumers across the nation are faced with rising food and fuel costs and the housing slump continues to impact consumer confidence despite these economic headwinds our business is still producing significant operating cash flows and our results are generally in line with our expectations for the quarter we remain confident in our ability to manage through these difficult economic times and believe we will be prepared to capitalize on growth opportunities when conditions normalize
159677 our veteran management team has been through difficult times before and is drawing on that experience to guide us through this challenging period we continue to aggressively refine our operations exploring new and innovative ways to run our businesses and control costs without compromising the integrity of our entertainment offering
159678 as we stated last quarter we expect stronger second half margins in our supply business segment compared with first half margins
159679 however on top of the previously announced loss of several key 2007 earnings contributors the continued increase in coal commodity and transportation costs combined with lower than planned results from our marketing and trading activities prompts us to lower our 2008 ongoing earnings forecast today
159680 as we look ahead to initiating our 2009 earnings forecast later this year we anticipate that rising delivered fuel prices and the completion of our scrubber construction program coupled with the fall in sulfur dioxide allowance prices will create challenges for us in 2009 compared with our expected results in 2008
159681 while we will clearly continue to explore ways to mitigate these cost pressures we expect that our 2009 earnings will be lower than what we expect to achieve in 2008 our ability to recover these fuel price increases is constrained by the fixed price provider of last resort contract that expires at the end of 2009
159682 we are more optimistic about our earnings outlook for 2010 than we were a year ago when we established our current forecast range of 4 00 to 4 60 per share
159683 based on what we have been able to achieve through our rigorous hedging program and the prices that we currently see in the marketplace we anticipate that for 2010 and beyond our generating portfolio and marketing expertise will allow us to continue to increase value for shareowners even in the face of higher fuel and other commodity costs
159684 ako iyong pinakatakot actually siya pwedeng okay na sa kanya ayaw ko lang masira iyong love team niya kay maja ayaw ko

159689 it was a very welcome news kasi akala ko talaga based on yung feeling ko noong nag audition ako feeling ko i didnt do so well so medyo na depress ako after the audition but when they actually told me that i got the job siyempre ang feeling ko naka tiyamba
159690 and it took a long time na makapagsara kami ni tita cory and naging tapat naman ako sa usapan na yon at si tita cory din ay naging tapat sa usapan
159691 ayun siya yung tumili for me siyempre after the initial excitement then she realized i will be gone for more than a month kasi sa south america yan e
159692 so when we realized na yun nga more than a month yun na realize namin na buti na lang nag quality time kami nang six months this year nakapag pondong quality time kaya we can spare i think 30 days apart

159694 we our doing our own version of the endemol show and we are going to shoot it in south america
159695 contestants will come to terms with their greatest fears and outdo themselves in a foreign land far from home and face their new environment
159696 noong pinag aralan namin they suggested why not do it either in south africa or argentina so it was just a matter of where it would be more practical for us to do it since we wanted to do it this year the consensus was to shoot it all cost considered in argentina
159697 yung series ng philippines will be the 31st series that will be shot in argentina so kabisadong kabisado na nila the props and the stunts are there the stunts supervisor all the experts handang handa na sila sa argentina so its more practical for us talaga na dalhin doon
159698 i can charge him with bribery or perjury because he told a lie in a sworn statement maybe even libel for trying to discredit me
159699 because i pitied him de borja i was trying to protect him and then he did this to me now hes trying to discredit me
159700 since i had given a firm no to his offer i thought the matter had already been settled mr de borja however kept pestering me with phone calls and text messages i never initiated the calls
159701 submit to a lie detector test to see whos telling the truth
159702 produce his phone records to prove that i ever contacted him
159703 the time i called i was with manolo lopez then he was on his way to america thats why its just me who came to talk to you
159704 related that because he is very close to the lopezes of meralco he wanted to call him regarding his possible inhibition in a certain meralco case
159705 lopezes desire that the same justice with whom the lopezes are more comfortable sit in the ca division
159706 to tell him once and for all to stop pestering me
159707 this case will be brought to the supreme court and you will still lose it would be a waste if you dont accept the p10 million your children may blame you later
159708 if you will not accept we will be forced to look for other ways no matter what i salute you
159709 mr de borja would be supported by the firm he told me he was the one who recommended the firm theyre really trying to intimidate me
159710 his affidavit was prepared by a lawyer to picture me as a person who would accept a bribe only a lawyer can do such a well presented affidavit
159711 i expect matters to get worse because im up against the billions of the lopezes
159712 what would it take or you to resist the governments offer
159713 empowering isabela voters to reclaim their democratic right to elect leaders of their own choosing and to contribute as full partners in their own development
159714 if people find it truthful we also print that so where is the bias
159715 we had a good quarter driven by strong underwriting results and positive investment returns our 94 combined ratio reflects good underwriting results from all parts of our business the highlight of the quarter from a top line perspective was the very strong start in our hagerty partnership which contributed significantly to our 9 overall premium growth for the period we are pleased with most aspects of our results and will continue to focus on underwriting discipline and capital management
159716 business conditions for the automobile industry deteriorated sharply again in the second quarter due to further ongoing steep rises in oil and raw material prices the weakness of the u s dollar the impact of the international financial crisis and a weaker u s economy
159717 we assume that 2009 will be another difficult year full of challenges
159718 gm previously announced that it anticipated a significant second quarter loss driven in large part by costs associated with the american axle and local us strikes and charges related to the successful us hourly attrition program actions to reduce north american truck capacity delphi and other matters
159719 as our recent product capacity and liquidity actions clearly demonstrate we are reacting rapidly to the challenges facing the us economy and auto market and we continue to take the aggressive steps necessary to transform our us operations
159720 the simple fact that encouraging mothers to breastfeed their infants cannot possibly create any real confusion or
159721 our state faces a looming cash crisis this situation leaves me with no easy choices
159722 this is not an action that i take lightly i understand that this will affect people at a time when they are already struggling and so i want to apologize to all the state employees for having to do that
159723 the whole place was packed with people trying to figure out how to get served
159724 go ahead were all getting laid off or minimum wage
159725 our workers have received mixed messages from their supervisors about which employees will be exempt and which employees will not be exempt
159726 he cant force us to do anything different than were already doing
159727 he is under pressure and were all under pressure thats why i dont understand why this distraction was needed
159728 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on

159743 new leadership and im liking it thats what causes a bottom
159744 this stock is beginning to get beat up too aggressively
159745 i think we might be having a little tug of war
159746 and i just cant close my eyes to that sea change
159747 no tengo ninguna duda de que con la plantilla que tenemos cambiar la din mica de otros a os queremos que la gente venga al campo a disfrutar dar una alegr a a la afici n y estar nosotros tranquilos tambi n
159748 deseando enfrentarnos a equipos de empaque porque hasta ahora los equipos han sido de menos categor a para coger confianza queremos jugar contra equipos que nos pongan en m s dificultades para ver qu nivel podemos llegar a dar el equipo est trabajando bien nadie se quiere quedar fuera todos quieren demostrar cosas el equipo est saliendo a lo que nos dice el entrenador y estamos contentos de momento con el trabajo hasta ahora

159752 dominated campaign coverage last week and became one of the biggest campaign events thus far with 62 percent of the public saying they heard a lot about it
159753 despite all the media attention and the high level of public awareness only 15 percent say they have learned a great deal about obamas approach to foreign policy from hearing or reading about his overseas trip kohut notes
159754 a third say they learned some about his foreign policy views but more than half 5 percent say they didnt learn much or learned nothing at all
159755 as has been the case throughout the general election campaign coverage of obama outweighed that of republican john mccain last week by a significant margin kohut notes 81 percent of the campaign stories analyzed by the project for excellence in journalism prominently featured the illinois senator while 53 percent featured mccain
159756 we have no objection if they want to go to their countries on their own will but we are concerned about their well being
159757 we look to this step with hope as the beginning of a systematic campaign for fighting rampant corruption but we think it lacks the required degree of seriousness
159758 such a move will falter if it is not coupled with the required transparency and the legal mechanism that governs the process of fighting corruption and if the job is not assigned to people of integrity
159759 putting an end to the illegal attrition of public wealth and other forms of corruption is an integral part of any democratic system of government
159760 boost the welfare and progress of arab societies and help push forward with development
159761 aware of the fact that corruption represented a stumbling bloc for human development and runs counter to the pillars and values of arab culture
159762 by doing so we can count on a pool of experience for addressing this peril
159763 lies in copying the definition of corruption as developed by democratic european countries in the same way we import technology
159764 it is my hope that the american public will someday hear mr hamdans defense
159765 it is not the defense that has requested this closed session
159766 but it is necessary according to the government to protect the information
159767 naomi went from one doctor to another in america pulled all her contacts and did not take no for an answer my daughter saved my life

159780 ive been boxing for a while now i know for a fact from practicing boxing in the past that its a great workout
159781 the goal here is not only to provide the soldiers a different way to work out and get in shape but also to instill discipline and self confidence because thats what boxing is all about
159782 just about everything you see came from our group we got together and came up with ideas from our different backgrounds we were able to put it all together and make the facility what it is today
159783 boxing causes you to think a lot you have to think about what youre going to do to defend yourself from an attack and what youre going to do as an offensive attack to your opponent
159784 you can definitely get in shape with this program that we have you are guaranteed to work every bit of your body with this you learn discipline and the basic skills of defense you will get a greater love of the sport
159785 people not in the brigade can still come and train they just cant get in the ring and do contact like sparring until we get a memorandum from their commander stating they are released to do that
159786 it was harder than i thought it was going to be all of a sudden i got scared and nervous all at the same time
159787 i started questioning my decision but after the first round i caught my breath and got a little more into it
159788 i didnt know much about boxing i still have a lot to learn im just learning the basics and getting it little by little every day
159789 if we dont have competitive taxes were going to continue to chase jobs away from ontario
159790 this is good news indeed since such changes will increase capital stock by 62 billion within five years time and improve worker annual incomes by 2 9 billion
159791 both provinces have effective tax rates on capital that are higher than the worldwide average and higher than rates in the united states
159792 i was offered a contract by dick james who was the manager of northern songs who in turn recorded all the beatles early discs
159793 it was an extraordinary meeting and he was quite insistent because hed heard me play the guitar and sing on stage as did john and ringo it was quite difficult for me to decide which way to go and then in the same week i was offered a line of small roles in classical theatre and i decided to follow that route

159808 the unstable buying price of palay would impoverish rice farmers instead of helping them

159813 some of whom are large producers themselves who could quite easily bring their own milk from aberdeen three or four times a week
159814 i think thats rubbish i dont think that would happen at all
159815 you cannot take milk from aberdeen and manufacture it here three times a week it wouldnt be fresh enough for one thing i doubt if there will be any change for producers whoever buys the dairy
159816 shetlanders have been the victims of both seamen and dockers strikes in the past when no milk reached shetland and rationing was enforced
159817 the hosiery trade has been very important in shetland but for the benefit derived from that industry many in these islands would have been reduced to the point of starvation

159836 its crucial that we know what the rocks are beneath our feet our changing climate means the need for this information is even more urgent
159837 identifying geohazards such as earthquakes and volcanoes is often a matter of life or death
159838 other challenges facing all nations in the 21st century include rising sea levels management of waste and storage of carbon
159839 knowledge of the rocks that we all live on has become increasingly important and sharing that knowledge at a time of global environmental change is crucial

159843 push for strategies that raise the stock price of the few companies they own but may lower the stocks of other companies or that raise prices in the short term while harming companies long term prospects
159844 the shareholders of the generally much larger acquirer often lose when the acquirers stock declines
159845 t he result is often an anemic over leveraged company that lacks the funds to invest in long term projects and that cannot weather economic downturns
159846 serious problem for long term average investors trying to save for retirement
159847 entrepreneurs and managers more reluctant to operate as public companies

159860 with cognisance of the dangerous consequences we asked the ecumenical patriarch not to proceed with uncanonical moves if that call is received with understanding we are ready to concelebrate the divine liturgy and hold talks with him otherwise we may see an ecclesiastical division that could be compared to the events of 1054 the great schism
159861 to avoid your personal participation in the celebrations so that your presence cannot be interpreted as a show of support for possible anti canonical acts
159862 the source of the clash between the two patriarchates is precisely the significance of ukraine which for the orthodox church is as great as the geostrategic political energy and defence importance of ukraine is right now ukraine has shifted westwards in all these areas and it is doing the same ecclesiastically the west for ukraine means constantinople the opposite pole from moscow which also happens to be kievs mother church

159884 these systems allow the viewer to see sights that have not been seen before that are just ravishing
159885 its like youre in your own little airplane flying along with these guys giving you a sense of their power and speed
159886 instead of describing the course verbally well use this mapping technology something which today is instantly recognizable by consumers to give a clear picture
159887 theres a camera embedded in the weightlifting platform shooting up through glass to give you a bottoms up look at a weightlifter
159888 with lead athletes the difference between clearing the bar and just brushing it can be a question of millimeters having that lipstick camera there can mean the difference between getting a medal and maybe not
159889 our mantra here is storytelling we not only want to demystify a sport for the american audience but we want to engage our audience in these sports
159890 it really hasnt changed my thoughts on racing its shown me things can happen in an instant
159891 its something im going to have to get used to because i still want to go out there and race
159892 i was pretty scared and didnt know exactly what had happened
159893 they were telling me to calm down and at first i was fighting against them
159894 when my dad herbert came out and told me to do what they said i calmed down and let them put the neck brace on me they got my upper body out of the car and got me off the track
159895 at first it didnt bother me because tabitha had been in a few wrecks and hit the wall a couple times
159896 as a mother i didnt start getting nervous until the brought out the ambulance when they stretchered her out i started to panic and get scared
159897 obviously our first thought is we hope these people are all right because theyre our extended family
159898 it was a coordinated effort these people are professionals and they did a wonderful job protecting the well being of our drivers while still clearing the track quickly to keep the event going
159899 its hard for people to believe but its been a lot of fun and i really enjoy it
159900 whatever she wants to do we support her as much as we can
159901 we told her if she wants to continue after the crash well help her and if she didnt we wouldnt be upset she wants to be involved in this
159902 weve just had so many people call to check on her and see if they can help we want to thank everybody for their support and thoughts and prayers for her its really very overwhelming and we really appreciate it
159903 it makes me real happy knowing that no matter what happens i have people behind me
159904 there is no reason why air tourism needs to create undue noise and stress over residential neighborhoods and scenic environmental areas
159905 air tours could take routes that dont impact residents and visitors but the problem is that many air tour operators just dont seem to care
159906 in the late 1980s and again in the late 1990s voluntary fly neighborly programs were instituted to keep helicopters from flying over populated areas
159907 but the tour industry didnt keep its word either time the helicopters soon resumed their flights over residential areas and now the problem has become far worse as noisy biplanes fixed wing airplane tours and ultralight planes fly over our towns and beaches
159908 theres a lot of anxiety and frustration on the north shore
159909 for the most part the air tourism industry is following the program and being community minded but i dont think that its 100 percent
159910 im hopeful at this point that we can have some positive dialogue between the companies and the community and if necessary the faa
159911 its an issue that can be overcome we can get back to a place where everyone can peacefully coexist
159912 if they called us direct and said someone flew over their place wed do something about it
159913 but if we dont get direct calls theres nothing we can really do
159914 we dont fly over hanalei bay or the other areas theyre complaining about except in case of bad weather
159915 its a vocal minority pushing this were doing what we can
159916 few of the operators are meeting their commitment to keep away from homes neighborhoods and sacred sites
159917 it would be a shame to deny that experience but theres a way to manage it
159918 every now and then someone goes off the beaten path and everyone suffers because of it
159919 sometimes it takes extreme measures to get really productive dialogue
159920 the noise impacts all of us residents and tourists alike
159921 no one likes it visitors to kalalau and kokee complain about feeling invaded as the aircraft fly into remote valleys and through the canyon
159922 all of us recognize the importance of tourism to kauais economy
159923 in the end we will either have a respectful air tourism industry or no air tourism industry we seek the former but the choice will be made by the industry
159924 deposit institutions are used more frequently to launder the proceeds of crime than any other single sector of the canadian economy
159925 listen the eagles are coming to town this weekend there is going to be a lot of people and there is probably going to be some petty crime and you are going to have a heightened police presence to deal with the crowds and traffic
159926 a casino really isnt any different when you attract a high number of people there will be a higher incidence of crime it just goes with population
159927 there will no doubt be more incidents but in terms of it being statistically out of the norm or the general population of moncton being at an increased risk that is not true at all
159928 you have to remember that the construction hasnt started on the facility and that is going to give a time for people to do a lot of things to get ready and that includes safety and security within the building
159929 you have to remember that casinos have some of the most stringent rules and regulations you will find in anywhere
159930 its almost like a three pronged approach there is the operators of the casino that have a lot of experience in many of their facilities and then you have the rcmp that patrols that region and obviously the department of public safety which works with law enforcement
159931 i think its the anticipation and the fear of the unknown rather than what actually occurs
159932 there is a high level of security and control in gaming centre sand casinos there are security cameras people discreetly on the floor supervising they are highly trained to spot things before they develop
159933 there is a lot less rowdiness or silly activity occurring on the floor of a casino than in a well attended bar on a saturday at midnight
159934 if the people that are in the casino are mostly from the local population they are going to reflect local norms
159935 obviously we like to keep the photos up so they can see them when they come back here
159936 they really put a personal touch into taking care of the animals
159937 having traveled and left my animals i know that it matters
159938 we both sort of looked at each other and said well take them

159952 in 1996 richard holbrooke a facut o oferta ministrilor si oamenilor de stat care ma reprezentau prin care se angaja in numele statelor unite ca nu voi fi judecat de acest tribunal

159954 prima neregula pe care o mentionez este vanatoarea de vrajitoare declansata de presa musulmana chiar inaintea inceperii conflictului armat presa care m a declarat criminal de razboi in momentul in care singurele victime erau doar sarbii
159955 este evident pentru majoritatea oamenilor ca aceasta curte nu ma va achita cred ca aceste fapte pun serios in pericol corectitudinea acestui proces
159956 information of this attack was shared very late with pakistan this was a case where the u s did not want to alert the pakistanis in advance because of concerns over information leaks
159957 the foreign newspapers keep writing such things against isi and we reject these allegations
159958 what the u s wants is a revamp especially among the isis units which deal with areas along the afghan border additionally the u s wants to see new structures in place for closer oversight on people in the field basically within the isi there has to be a strong internal affairs unit of a kind

159960 moment the bill achieves royal assent likely to be the first half of 2009 and this note is to alert all members of the plp that they will need to comply with the new regulations when they come into force
159961 the suggestion that the gould report impacts on changes to part finances and expenditure controls is inaccurate the report was concerned with the administration of elections
159962 controls on candidate spending have existed since 1883 the government is not therefore inventing them it is merely reverting to the previous system in terms of when they become active
159963 our plans have not been dealt a blow candidate spending infringements will be regulated by the police and the courts and not the electoral commission
159964 when stock car racing was desperate to capture the imagination of sports fans they did anything they could to conjure up images of the indianapolis 500 and the number was the easiest way to do that
159965 it felt a lot like the 24 hours of daytona
159966 you just rode around trying to survive and every lap youd ride by the flagman thinking please throw that checkered flag soon
159967 when i was running in the busch series i used to love watching cup races on sunday
159968 i could watch the start and then during the middle i had time to go take a shower and take my kids to the mall or something and still get home in plenty of time to see the finish
159969 but it didnt bother me one bit to get out of the car an hour earlier than we had been
159970 we did not hit those shots down the stretch and they did
159971 they hit free throws and just did what they needed to do
159972 we know theyre going to come out and try to box and one taber spani and theyre going to try to pinch on chiney ogwumike we have stuff for that we just didnt put the ball in the hole we ran plays and got the shots we wanted we just didnt put the ball in the hole
159973 i thought carly got the best of ogwumike this game
159974 she beat her on both ends of the floor and outplayed her but she had help
159975 whenever wed compete against each other it was pretty intense
159976 russells 10 times better than i am at either football or baseball
159977 you have to be supertalented to do both as well as he does in baseball you expect him to get a hit every time and in football im amazed at the type of leader he is
159978 he was a starter in the infield after only five weeks
159979 we didnt have him the whole fall and he came to practice on jan 10 after two to three weeks you could see the talent there hes a tremendous athlete and his instincts are so good the time away hurt him in the field he was a little rusty when he came back but what amazed me is that he was still able to hit even in the acc one of the top leagues in the country
159980 to play in the outfield for a guy as talented as wilson is actually easy
159981 there are wide receivers or cornerbacks who get bored in the spring and go out and run the 200 meters on the track team i dont think thats as much a two sport athlete as russell wilson
159982 i knew my whole life i wanted to play two sports in college
159983 harry was a big influence on me in a lot of different ways telling me ive got to be tough and constantly on the grind hes always been there for me i love him to death
159984 i saw this kid playing shortstop with a great arm and someone told me he was a top quarterback recruit in football
159985 so i called up then nc state head football coach chuck amato and told him about russell
159986 a lot of scouts said russell could have been taken in the third or fourth round of the 07 mlb draft and were making calls trying to get him to sign
159987 i have no doubt hell make it to the big leagues
159988 he told me dont ever let anyone tell you you cant play two sports do what your heart tells you that was motivating for me especially coming from someone who played professionally my goals long term are to play professionally but being successful for me means being a leader in your community people like brian jordan kids look up to them i want to be someone like that
159989 russell handles both sports as well as anybody ive ever seen
159990 the things this guy has done and continues to do so far hes done it unbelievably well hes such a positive guy he always has a smile on his face were so proud to be associated with such a first class person from a first class family for all our students who say they dont have time to do certain things tell them the russell wilson story
