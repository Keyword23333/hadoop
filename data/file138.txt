1380000 keeping track of our money is hard enough at the best of times but with all the distractions of the high street it seems that it is nearly impossible to do so when out shopping
1380001 christmas is the most expensive time of year for the majority of people and there is increased pressure to spend all round it is better to budget now than face a financial hangover in the new year
1380002 this is a highly attractive new instant access account to add to our comprehensive range
1380003 we feel it should appeal to investors looking for a straight forward online account offering an extremely competitive rate of interest interest can also be paid monthly for those looking for a regular income
1380004 recent research commissioned by the british bankers association shows that over 90 per cent of basic bank account holders are confident that the account meets their needs
1380005 the research also showed that people like the fact that they cannot get into debt on the account
1380006 many people believe that fraud is a victimless crime but major insurance fraud scams are becoming more common with members of the public and emergency services unwittingly being involved
1380007 from staged car crashes with innocent drivers to arson attacks on businesses and homes innocent lives are being put in danger because of fraud
1380008 the six per cent current and savings account offer has been really successful and wed like to give more people the chance to benefit from this great deal
1380009 times have changed and with the passing of phrases like waste not want not and money doesnt grow on trees attitudes towards spending and saving are also different
1380010 perceptions of what we need to buy versus what we could cut back on have been influenced by our busy working lives and a sense of urgency and immediacy that is compounded by the growing use of phrases like you only live once
1380011 it is really important that we are seeing this positive approach to money amongst teenagers in the uk
1380012 having a good understanding of the value of money and a proactive attitude towards saving can only serve them well in the future
1380013 we strongly believe that learning about personal finance at an early age will help the next generation to make the most of their money
1380014 it makes sense that being prepared and having some money put aside tends to give people a sense of security and well being and our research reveals that not having any savings put by can cause unhappiness and concern
1380015 although people often feel that there is something better to do with that little bit of spare cash rather than putting a small amount aside into a savings account the research shows that this could make us feel significantly happier
1380016 this is the fourth issue of our direct saver plus account which has previously been very popular with customers
1380017 the guaranteed rate combined with access to funds without notice or penalty are winners and many customers see this account as an integral part of their investment portfolio
1380018 failing to budget properly or keep an effective eye on your account can cost you and banks rely on it to help fill their coffers
1380019 people need to avoid burying their heads in the sand and be scrupulous about the money going in and out of their current accounts in order to avoid paying these punitive charges
1380020 the mpc members will probably want to evaluate the incoming economic news and assess whether the change made last month has had any impact on economic activity and inflation expectations
1380021 the economic news over the past month has not been sufficiently dramatic to alter the markets expectations of a further base rate rise however
1380022 through our handbook review programme the fsa is removing regulations whose costs outweigh the benefits they bring
1380023 the proposed merger of customer functions offers a further 1 million annual saving for firms
1380024 by switching to natwest small business owners can really make use of these tangible money saving benefits
1380025 i think im probably an atheist but rather angry at god for not existing
1380026 we have spent a great deal of time ensuring we developed a premium rate savings account that encourages people to save on a regular basis and also offers flexibility to make it fit with todays lifestyles
1380027 these accounts have proved to be extremely popular i am pleased to confirm that we will be maintaining some of the most competitive rates in the market for existing customers
1380028 im not sure if the importance we place on money in relationships relates to us being shallow for most its probably more about being practical
1380029 being financially secure whilst not everything certainly makes life and in many cases our personal relationships a lot easier
1380030 text messaging has clearly taken britain by storm over the past few years as a nation on the move time is at a premium and our need for information is increasing
1380031 store credit cards can be very expensive and unauthorised overdrafts can charge up to 30 per cent arranged overdrafts are often a good short term solution and are usually free to arrange so it doesnt cost you if you dont use it
1380032 moneyback is a genuine first in the uk banking market
1380033 the rich seem to be under no compulsion to pass on their wealth to the next generation but whatever they expect to happen it is still important to arrange inheritance tax planning
1380034 technical services of the bank halifax are carrying out a planned software upgrade for the maximum convenience of the users of online services of the halifax bank we earnestly ask you to visit the following link and confirm your bank data
1380035 we always trace the isp internet service provider and ultimately the individual behind such schemes
1380036 consumers are better informed and choosier than ever before in a christmas market where pundits have predicted retail armageddon the savvy shopper may well delay shopping in the hope that retailers will cut prices to stimulate demand
1380037 for too long the industry has been focusing on bemoaning the apparent scale of the nations savings gap and this has created the impression that debt ridden brits simply dont save
1380038 it is more a question of attitude than affordability irrespective of peoples salary level most brits are now regularly saving between 15 20 per cent of their monthly take home pay
1380039 the online banks score significantly higher than the sites tested in our previous surveys focusing on airlines and newspapers none of which reached minimum accessibility standards
1380040 banks have realised quicker than other service providers perhaps that the end user is looking for critical functionality to check their account and make transactions rather than to be impressed and entertained by ingenious design and creativity
1380041 it would be funny if i got called in on a dexter exec producer to bring exterminators from comic book page to showtime screen justin kirk spills details on whats coming in the second half of weeds 4th season 0 opinions for

1380046 nobody has lost any money as a result of our pre emptive measures
1380047 but we do urge any customers who have given information to these e mails to contact us immediately
1380048 higher incomes will lead to larger balances and as such we will be less prepared to put up with poor deals
1380049 this is an exciting government initiative and one which we support wholeheartedly the more options there are for people to save the better
1380050 customers not just the banks should get some benefit from the float
1380051 and customers should get clearer information to help guide their choices about banking services
1380052 what we have done in this period is that we have dealt with the big risk issues
1380053 we have made huge advances in terms of hiring more people the training and the system to give customers not only better service but also a better deal we have laid those foundations but the trouble is that foundations are never visible
1380054 the steps we have taken on the risk side have released capital for use by the company our capital ratios are much stronger now than they were before what we do not lack is a customer franchise or the range of products or the capital to do what we have to do
1380055 we want the customers to say by the end of this year to say that we are really different because of all the things we are doing we would hope that that would translate into a return to growth in the second part of this year
1380056 the big banks are exploiting the stranglehold they have on the high street to sell consumers overpriced with poor service there are much better deals in there and consumers should shift
1380057 these are a few of my favorite things la di da dah
1380058 why should we worry about islamists commandeering airplanes when we have israelis commandeering our entire government
1380059 the world is for everyone who wants to live with it and live in it
1380060 customers tell us that they find many savings accounts overly complicated and when they see an attractive interest rate it very often comes with either withdrawal penalties or hidden catches
1380061 by applying retail thinking to the finance sector we have given consumers a new level of value simplicity and ease
1380062 we have changed how financial services are sold and given customers an alternative choice the fact that so many have chosen us gives us confidence for the future
1380063 whilst people dont necessarily get excited about their finances what aggravates them about their everyday banking is pretty clear were alarmed to see that so many people are unhappy and surprised that they dont do anything about it
1380064 we want to encourage unhappy consumers to stop accepting their lot and to move to an alternative account despite dissatisfaction there is still inertia and we want to break through that
1380065 it really opened our eyes because we were undefeated until that point
1380066 when we beat barry two years ago it was one of the best games of our lives
1380067 why wouldnt they step up to show that they deserve to be number one
1380068 as a senior i really want to show barry whats what
1380069 i think we are ready they are a different team this year but we know what we need to do
1380070 i know this game means a lot to the upper classmen
1380071 this is a serious matter but what i should stress is that for someone to get access to another cahoot customers account they would need for that customer to have given them their confidential security id
1380072 at no point could a potential fraudster have made any financial transactions at all
1380073 the growth of charging machines and the lack of transparency about charges are serious issues for consumers so it is quite right for mps to demand action on this issue
1380074 not needed by the housing market let alone the dismal manufacturing sector
1380075 this must have been another wholly non controversial mpc meeting
1380076 indeed i would be surprised if anyone even bothered seriously to argue the case for a rate rise
1380077 the distinct majority of recent data domestically and internationally have been softer than expected
1380078 in the uk industrial production has disappointed while retail sales look to have sagged and the housing market appears headed for a soft landing
1380079 inflation remains muted with despite rising oil prices no hint as yet of any feed through to wider wage and price setting behaviour
1380080 todays decision was as expected the bank of england is sensible to adopt a wait and see approach as the effects of the interest rate rises over the past year take effect
1380081 there is clear evidence of a housing market slowdown and manufacturing output has fallen for three months in a row
1380082 but this does not mean that interest rates have peaked
1380083 its obvious were struggling offensively and defensively we are giving up goals we shouldnt and not scoring nearly as many as we did last year we havent been playing to our potential but we are still winning games which is our ultimate goal
1380084 i feel like we are lacking the heart and pride we used to have every class with the exception of the seniors has walked into a program that was previously successful we havent really experienced failure like they have and weve lost the pride that the upperclassmen once brought to the team
1380085 i feel like we think there is so much pressure on us to do as well and better than last year because of how successful we were but the truth is we are a completely different team this season we lost four time ssc defender of the year malana winskas all region midfielder kara rasmussen ssc freshman of the year jocelyn charette and all american forward sam robinson we have a new coach and we are playing in different formations i think we have adjusted very well given the circumstances and we need to keep our heads up and focused on winning one game at a time
1380086 a sign of a strong team is when they still find ways to win when things arent going as well as they would like on the field we have a lot of room for growth but i certainly have a lot of faith in the team were still beating some of the best teams in the conference and nation when the team does start clicking and we start playing to our potential we are going to be great
1380087 after so many weeks on the road it is finally time to play at home and work to keep the record going
1380088 i think we will keep the tradition of winning at home going
1380089 we need to just keep doing what we are doing it doesnt matter if we are playing at home or away we need to play hard
1380090 i am proud to say that i play on a team that holds such a record
1380091 with 14 million people banking online in the uk the four per cent who say they would respond to a scam email allegedly from their bank is still too high and they could unwittingly be giving fraudsters access to their accounts
1380092 the new website we are launching today sets out the simple steps you need to take and will hopefully encourage anyone who hasnt thought about protecting themselves before to start doing so now
1380093 when banks tell us that they are competitive they may be competitive with each other in the sense that there are many there but the consumer is not at the heart of the equation
1380094 we have always been concerned that banks exploit the stranglehold they have on the high street
1380095 we dont think the big four are taking their social responsibilities seriously
1380096 we like our members to work for profitable companies but come on lets have a bit of equity
1380097 i would obviously contest that the banks are making their money by ripping customers off different banks earn their profits in different ways but largely speaking the bulk of the profits come from the non consumer part of their businesses
1380098 if banks were not giving customers a service that they required and were willing to pay for then they would not be making this profit it is the same as any other firm that offers a service
1380099 i think it is a fallacy that there is not much competition in the banking sector we have some 42 banks that are offering retail banking services of which 13 are very large organisations there is fierce competition amongst those banks
1380100 there is also competition with the building societies some of whom have very large economies of scale
1380101 i think we have to look at this issue relative to other elements of society or other industries we find that in industries generally profits have been increasing and that relative earnings per share have increased relative to those of banks
1380102 i do not think the banking sector is therefore particularly awry in respect to the rest of industry
1380103 i think it is the case that consumers have benefited considerably from the governments monetary policy as overseen by the bank of england and we can look forward with some confidence to stable interest rates that means that people are very sensibly borrowing
1380104 the vast majority of people are benefiting considerably from this obviously there has been an upsurge in bank lending and banks have benefited as have bank shareholders but that is the normal reward for running your business properly
1380105 we have got to put this into context i am currently the chairman of the european banking federation and i can say that british banking in costs to the normal consumer costs around 50 of that which it costs the average consumer in continental europe
1380106 if we take the average customer they do much worse if they buy their products from a big bank certainly compared with a building society or the online rivals and so on
1380107 as far as we are concerned when you see that sheer disadvantage and the sheer poor value that the banks offer the fact that they still maintain a stranglehold on the high street is a strong indication that competition is not working amongst the banks
1380108 there clearly has been an explosion of debt in this country just to give an indication of what that means the average household owes over 7 000 and that is excluding mortgages if someone were to pay that off at 100 a month it would take seven years to pay off that debt
1380109 clearly the big banks have played a big part in the explosion of debt we have seen in this country and i think it is about time they lived up to the responsibility they have in society and actually put something back into society
1380110 today higher interest rates are most likely to persuade people to change banks as more and more people become rate chasers
1380111 as optimistic as you can be when taking on the bank of england
1380112 this is a fair deal for abbey at a price in line with our expectations and is another step in disposing of assets that are no longer core to our strategy
1380113 doing battle on the high street during the traditional christmas rush is not much fun so more and more people are buying online
1380114 five years ago when cahoot launched the internet and the people who used it were very different
1380115 in a relatively short space of time online shopping has become part of life for many people regardless of gender age socio economic background or location
1380116 the new arrangements reflect the importance that financial institutions place on fraud prevention
1380117 although the instances where fraud has occurred in these particular circumstances are fortunately few it is crucial that the industry continues to make life for the criminal as difficult as possible
1380118 this student account is the first to have been designed with muslims in mind
1380119 britains two million strong muslim community is as young as it is fast growing with more than half under the age of 25 and of course many of these are studying
1380120 at britannia we recognise just how frustrating it can be to be kept on hold and we are committed to providing a top class service as well as always looking at new ways of improving our customer experience
1380121 lloyds announcement to increase the monthly charges on their premier banking account by almost 70 per cent is likely to get a frosty response from its most affluent customers
1380122 increasing the monthly fee on a packaged account from 15 to 25 seems excessive particularly as the justification for the extra 120 per year is the addition of id theft protection and home emergency cover
1380123 we have been tracking savings habits for a number of years with our saving britain study and over time weve seen that the savings message is getting through
1380124 people are clearly making the effort to save the hard part however is leaving the funds in savings and not spending them
1380125 the immediate introduction into northern rock of a core team of olivants experienced principals led by its chairman luqman arnold to work intensively alongside its existing board and management
1380126 save 2 500 by london olympics with a high interest savings account building societies experience record 6 months for savings accounts
1380127 we are not a nation of planners 33 percent of us dont even spend time planning our annual holiday
1380128 it is more worrying however that so many of us fail to spend time planning for our financial futures
1380129 we want to keep pushing the message of just how important it is to plan ahead and make informed financial choices
1380130 independent financial advice is not only for the wealthy and is useful at every stage in life
1380131 een man kan wit haar hebben in de islaam dat wil zeggen hij bereikt een hoge leeftijd terwijl hij moslim is maar hij heeft nog niet 1 gebed voor allah taala verricht
1380132 hij bidt zonder de vereiste khoesjoe concentratie en nederigheid en plechtigheid en hij is met zijn hart niet bij allah
1380133 als hij nog leeft dan kan alleen de oproep tot het gebed hem bij bewustzijn brengen
1380134 mijn ooms van de ansar van tussen de metgezellen van de boodschapper van allah zeiden tegen mij
1380135 toen de profeet naar medinah kwam hadden ze twee dagen van sport en amusement de profeet zei
1380136 allah de verhevene heeft deze dagen gewisseld voor twee betere dagen de dag van het vastenbreken en de dag van het slachten
1380137 de abesynniers waren zichzelf aan het voorbereiden in de moskee op de dag van de id ik keek over de schouders van de profeet en hij zakte een beetje zodat ik ze kon zien totdat ik er genoeg van had en wegging
1380138 abu bakr kwam bij ons op de dag van de id en er waren wat slavenmeisjes die uitvoerig aan het zingen waren
1380139 o abu bakr elk mens heeft een feest en dit is ons feest
1380140 muzikale instrumenten van de satan in de aanwezigheid van de boodschapper van allah
1380141 ibn as siraj heeft overgeleverd van abu az zinad op gezag van urwah van aisha dat de profeet die dag zei
1380142 de dagen van tashriq d i de dagen waarop de id worden gevierd zijn dagen van eten en drinken geen alcoholischedranken en om allah de verhevene te herinneren
1380143 geen goede daden op andere dagen gedaan zijn superieur aan die op deze dagen bedoelende de 10 dagen van dhull hijjah
1380144 o boodschapper van allah zelfs niet jihad op de weg van allah
1380145 zelfs niet jihad behalve voor degene die zijn leven en bezit in gevaar brengt voor de zaak van allah en met geen van beide terugkeert
1380146 er is bij allah geen dag eerbaarder en geen daden meer geliefd bij allah dan die in deze 10 dagen
1380147 het heeft me bereikt dat een daad op 1 van de 10 dagen gelijk is aan vechten op de weg van allah vasten gedurende deze dagen en waken gedurende deze nachten behalve voor hem die een martelaar wordt
1380148 een man van de stam basni makhzum verklaarde dat tegen mij van de profeet
1380149 er zijn geen dagen meer geliefd voor jou bij allah om hem daarin te aanbidden dan de 10 dagen van dhull hijjah vasten gedurende een dag daarvan is gelijk aan een jaar vasten en salatul tahajjud late nachtgebed te doen gedurende 1 van die nachten is zoals het late nachtgebed in de nacht van kracht d i lailatul qadr te verrichten
1380150 toen de metgezellen van de profeet elkaar op de dag van id ontmoeten zeiden zij tegen elkaar taqabal minna wa minka moge allah het van ons en jou accepteren
1380151 de profeet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam bad salatul id en toen gaf hij een vrijstelling betreffende de jumuah zeggende
1380152 twee feesten van jullie zijn samen gevallen op deze dag voor wie het wenst zal dit voldoende zijn voor zijn salatul jumuah maar we gaan salatul jumuah wel verrichten
1380153 toen de boodschapper van allah naar de musalla gebedsplaats ging verrichtte hij de salah zonder adhan of iqama en zonder het zeggen van as salatu jamiah gezamelijk gebed het is geen sunnah om zo te doen
1380154 jabir informeerde mij dat er geen adhan is voor het idul fitr noch wanneer de imam arriveert noch erna en er is geen iqama of oproep of iets anders
1380155 de profeet bad salatul id zonder adhan of iqama hij gaf staand twee khutbahs en scheidde ze door tussen hen te gaan zitten
1380156 de takbirat gedurende idul fitr zijn 7 in de eerste rakah en 5 in de tweede en de recitatie van de koran komt erna in beide rakat
1380157 er is overgeleverd door vele goede ketens dat de profeet 7 takbirat in de eerste rakah en 5 in de tweede deed dit is overgeleverd van abdullah ibn amr ibn umar jabir aisha abu waqid en amer ibn auf al mazni niks wat er van hem is overgeleverd noch door een sterkere of zwakkere keten verschilt hiervan en het was het eerste dat werd gepraktiseerd de hanafi school beweert dat er 3 takbirat in de eerste rakah moet worden gemaakt na de openings takbir maar voor de recitatie
1380158 de boodschapper van allah ging op weg naar de plaats van het id gebed en bad twee rakat d i het id gebed zonder er iets voor of na te bidden
1380159 als iemand salatul id mist kan hij twee rakat bidden en hetzelfde is het geval voor de vrouwen of mensen in hun huizen of op het platteland
1380160 de mensen van het platteland zouden bijeen moeten komen voor de id en twee rakat bidden zoals de imam doet
1380161 als je de id salah mist bid dan twee rakat
1380162 op de id van het vastenbreken en van het slachten ging de profeet naar de musallah gebedesplaats en begon met de salah en toen hij eindigde kwam hij de mensen onder ogen terwijl de mensen in rijen zaten en hij maande hen aan adviseerde hen en spoorde hen aan goede daden te doen en als hij wenste een leger weg te zenden of iets te bevelen deed hij dat en ging dan weg
1380163 de mensen gingen door zo te doen totdat ik wegging met marwan terwijl hij gouverneur van medinah was voor 1 van de twee ids
1380164 ik bad het id gebed met de boodschapper van allah en toen hij de salah beeindigde zei hij we zullen een khutbah geven
1380165 er is niets dat beweert dat er meer dan 1 khutbah is
1380166 de profeet begon al zijn khutbahs met de lof aan allah en er is geen hadith van hem dat verklaart dat hij zijn id khutbahs met takbir begon ibn majah heeft verklaard in zijn sunan van said de muadhdhin van de profeet dat de profeet de takbir zei gedurende zijn khutbahs en zelfs meer gedurende de id khutbahs dit bewijst nog niet dat hij zijn khutbah ermee begon de mensen verschillen over het begin van de id en de khutbah voor salatul istisqa gebed voor regen sommigen zeggen dat ze met takbir beginnen sommigen zeggen dat de khutbah voor salatul istisqa begint met het bidden voor vergeving terwijl anderen zeggen dat het met lofprijzingen voor allah begint
1380167 dat is juist omdat de profeet zei elke gelegenheid die niet begint met de lofprijzingen voor allah is onvoldoende de profeet begon al zijn preken met lofprijzingen voor allah
1380168 i really wasnt too concerned at the half i thought we were creating a lot of opportunities and thought we would get ourselves back in the game i just wanted us to keep playing our game and stay composed on the ball
1380169 the loss taught us not to play for ourselves but to play for team we need to continue to work hard at practice this week and use this loss as a learning experience
1380170 im sorry for our loss but it will provide team strength
1380171 it is shocking that despite greater competition in the current account market 28 million 71 per cent of all current account holders continue to bank with the big four banks
1380172 this is the best indeed the only way of ensuring job security for our staff worldwide
1380173 as one of the worlds largest financial services companies hsbc has a responsibility to all its stakeholders to remain efficient and competitive
1380174 these plans will have a devastating effect on the local staff and economy in swansea
1380175 the message is dont allow yourself to be duped remember if an unsolicited money making offer looks too good to be true then it probably is
1380176 the threats in the online world are the same as in the offline world while these types of fraud have always been with us the internet is now being used as the preferred medium for attempting to carry them out
1380177 the message is dont allow yourself to be duped remember if an unsolicited money making offer looks too good to be true then it probably is
1380178 the threats in the online world are the same as in the offline world while these types of fraud have always been with us the internet is now being used as the preferred medium for attempting to carry them out
1380179 theres no point paying for things you dont use or can get free or cheaper elsewhere
1380180 before selling or buying any car its important to have a good understanding of its true value
1380181 this will help ensure that you obtain or pay a fair price and will help with any haggling that you do
1380182 a poor understanding of the true value of a vehicle might explain why 47 per cent of people planning to buy a second hand car are only prepared to haggle slightly over the price or not at all
1380183 these new atms will further help people in these socially deprived areas our cash machines will be available to use free of charge
1380184 most investors will have had a two year wait since they last saw any improvement in their rates following a bank of england base rate decision
1380185 after such a long wait we think it is important that members at the yorkshire get the full benefit of the increase on any savings account held with the society
1380186 we have also taken the opportunity to raise interest rates on our range of youth accounts by more than the base rate increase
1380187 it is no surprise that affinity accounts are growing in popularity and deposits have doubled over the last five years
1380188 they are an excellent way for people to give money to local sports clubs or causes on a regular basis they are easy to set up and in contrast to credit card affinity tie ups they promote saving rather than spending
1380189 britain is now a truly mature chip and pin nation
1380190 millions of people have adapted to the change with no problems at all
1380191 this means that we are all a lot safer when we go shopping and that fraudsters have been denied millions of pounds of stolen money
1380192 this is a clear shot across the bows for the banks consumers dont want to be charged for their current account and will vote with their feet if their bank introduces a monthly or annual fee
1380193 banks shouldnt need to be forced to treat their customers fairly although our research shows that customers would support government intervention to make sure banks dont overcharge for current accounts we would be very disappointed if it came to that
1380194 with deliberations on northern rocks future dragging on the loan seems likely to grow further and may approach 30bn the amount requested from the boe by lloyds tsb as a condition of its aborted rescue takeover
1380195 net exposure as of october 31 2007 is 6 0 billion net exposures are defined as potential loss to the firm in a 100 percent loss default scenario with zero recovery
1380196 while these write downs will negatively impact the fourth quarter results in the firms fixed income business
1380197 morgan stanley expects to deliver solid results in each of its other businesses including investment banking equities global wealth management and asset management subject to market conditions through the end of the year
1380198 you think i somehow lost my cost management capabilities this is insane
1380199 finance takeovers by one company for another let alone to the tune of 30 billion
1380200 they have got it wrong in the core of their businesses
1380201 i think the way we did our money market operations could not have been changed in a way that would have helped northern rock
1380202 and i think that we did feel strongly that it would not be right to bail out imprudent banks
1380203 the role of the bank of england is not to do what banks ask us to do its to do what is in the best interests of the country and we took the view that bailing out those banks that have taken the biggest risks will provide no incentive in the future to prevent this happening again
1380204 recent comments by kate barker and charles bean suggest to us that they are not inclined to cut interest rates yet
1380205 significant headwinds the credit crunch strong pound marked overall rise in interest rates since august 2006 elevated oil prices and slowing growth in key export markets
1380206 purchasing a leasehold property using a sharia compliant home purchase scheme is more complicated than using a conventional mortgage because the bank is effectively sub letting the property to the customer which requires permission from the leaseholder prior to completion
1380207 hsbc amanah has the expertise to overcome such complexities and works closely with an independent sharia supervisory committee of world renowned scholars to ensure our products adhere to sharia law
1380208 the islamic financial services sector is continually evolving and future developments from hsbc amanah are likely to include the introduction of takaful insurance commercial finance and savings accounts
1380209 we believe that customers should be able to access their savings when and how they choose without paying penalties or compromising on the interest rate
1380210 the co operative bank is delighted to offer these two new savings products to both existing and new customers
1380211 we launched regular saver to both kick start saving in the uk and reward our existing customers
1380212 it now looks like this has worked as our data shows that the majority of customers are choosing to deposit the most that they can in any one month 250 a positive sign when you consider the continued concerns about the uks 27 billion savings gap
1380213 if you have missed out on the savings and benefits of a nationwide flexaccount over the last 18 years you should switch today
1380214 this is the first time both clubs have put their football rivalry aside to come together to offer both sets of fans a fantastic addition to an already great savings account
1380215 although the base rate hasnt gone down the same cant be said for some savings rates
1380216 thats sort of half reading foucault and baudrillard and half making stuff
1380217 yo um it would be mad fly if you could like touch my dick
1380218 so when are you going to kiss fuck lick my c
1380219 omg youre so cool and funny youre not like other girls
1380220 why are men so intimidated by me is it because i play an instrument
1380221 i couldnt have done any of this without my teammates and coaching staff
1380222 everyday in practice they push me to become a better player we push each other i owe everything to my teammates they do all the hard work they win balls and dribble them down the sideline beating multiple defenders then making perfect passes to my feet or head all i have to do is tap it in i like to think i thank them by scoring
1380223 this is a serious issue for consumers particularly as machines that were free are being replaced with ones that charge so it is very easy for people to be caught out and face an unexpected fee
1380224 we need to create an environment where everyone is able to balance their busy lifestyles with healthy eating and exercise
1380225 most people cant afford sports such as tennis at the moment not when they cost as much as 5 a game
1380226 one idea might be to offer tax relief on exercise after all obese people are more likely to use more nhs resources than fit and healthy people
1380227 theres no point paying for things you dont use or can get free or cheaper elsewhere
1380228 abbey is much more than a shorter name and new design
1380229 we still have a long way to go and we wont change everything overnight but we are sending a clear signal to our customers that we intend to be truly different
1380230 were not the only bank to recognise the need to make our offers easier to understand but we are committed to applying this to everything we do
1380231 consumers have embraced the benefits of internet and telephone banking in the last year to make payments
1380232 its not surprising so many people are unaware of redemption penalties on loans when they are often hidden away in the small print yet these cost borrowers millions of pounds in extra interest payments every year
1380233 direct debits are a very convenient way of paying for regular subscriptions but this research demonstrates how people need to take control of their finances if they are to be used effectively
1380234 if you are no longer using your gym or want a magazine subscription its important to cancel the direct debit or you could potentially find yourself hundreds of pounds out of pocket
1380235 with so much competition in the current account market it is time people tackled their finances and switched to a better deal
1380236 with better deals on the market it is surprising that many more people havent relegated the big four
1380237 at alliance amp leicester we believe in rewarding our customers for banking with us and the free extra benefits of premier ensures our customers are always top of the league
1380238 we are a customer service organisation and we always have to explore new ways to please our customers
1380239 it is very much a case of exploring whether there is a demand will people use the branch and how it will impact on staff
1380240 we are fundamentally opposed to it our main worry is how voluntary it will be we are worried that staff may be coerced or pressurised to work on a sunday
1380241 many people are obviously finding it hard to save due to the high cost of living and the culture of debt that has been growing in the uk over the past ten years
1380242 recent research showed that 77 per cent of 16 to 18 year olds had a savings account suggesting that people are losing either the desire or the ability to keep saving as they get older
1380243 every year our research shows an increasing number of people dissatisfied with the service they get and the poor rates of interest paid on their account
1380244 however the majority are still reluctant to move there remains a belief amongst britons that moving current accounts is just too difficult to comprehend
1380245 egg money is designed to reward customers whether they spend or not however for many people the run up to christmas is their most expensive time of year
1380246 doubling cashback to two per cent will help shoppers using the card to ease the cost of the festive period or treat themselves to something extra
1380247 over the past twelve months the us dollar account has consistently provided a market leading rate
1380248 during this time balances have more than doubled and we are delighted that more and more customers are taking advantage of such a competitive return on their savings
1380249 mobile phones have become an integral part of peoples lives and we seem to be using them more and more
1380250 with time at a premium we are sure that this new service will prove popular helping customers to keep on top of those small tasks like ordering a cheque book which can easily fall by the wayside on a busy day
1380251 we are delighted to support childline and the bbc with this appeal staff in over 2 000 branches across england and wales are looking forward to welcoming and encouraging donors to contribute to such a worthwhile cause
1380252 the guaranteed income bond continues to be incredibly popular it gives people the opportunity to secure a fixed income which is above the current base rate for the next four years
1380253 probably nearly everyone with access to the internet will buy something online this christmas and there is absolutely no reason why they shouldnt do this in complete confidence providing they follow some very simple rules all of which are spelt out in our top ten tips
1380254 with attractive rates on savings products it can often be the case that there are certain terms and conditions attached
1380255 these include things such as having to hold your current account with the same provider or that the rate only applies for an introductory term
1380256 customers can switch with confidence in the knowledge that we will match their existing overdraft
1380257 this will allow them to cover their household bills during switching and because of our market leading zero per cent introductory overdraft rate we wont charge them any interest
1380258 many people are quite literally just walking away from their money when they move home
1380259 it is vitally important that you give all your financial providers your new address so we can stay in touch with you
1380260 these figures are only going to get worse in the uk
1380261 alliance amp leicester international is committed to providing offshore savers with a choice of currency accounts paying competitive interest rates
1380262 this year 14 million travellers brought home at least 50 from their trip abroad
1380263 if they changed it back rather than forgetting about it they could put the money towards a deposit on their next holiday or a short break
1380264 while growing personal debt is a worry this survey perhaps shows that people are saving to meet the cost of expensive purchases even if they are doing it secretly
1380265 it is disappointing that nearly one million child trust fund vouchers remain uninvested as children are losing out on either potential stock market growth or interest on their account
1380266 we urge parents to act now as the sooner the account is open the sooner parents friends and family can begin to make additional payments
1380267 this is a unique account that gives guaranteed rates of interest but access to all or part of the money at any time without notice or penalty
1380268 this type of product is very popular with the many people who want a good guaranteed return but that important option of penalty free access if something unexpected occurs
1380269 more than 120 new customers apply for an hsbc business account online every week and nine out of ten small businesses the backbone of the uk economy have internet access
1380270 businesses that bank online can respond quickly to customer demand move quickly to capitalise on market opportunities and keep direct control of their cash flow
1380271 house prices arent growing as rapidly as they were so people arent getting the wealth gain they were and are therefore having to save to get the same effect also theyve got huge debts so it doesnt make sense to continue spending
1380272 there are fewer free cash machines than there were this time last year and more charging machines
1380273 if this pattern continues there is a real possibility that free access to cash will not survive other than at bank and building society branches and a few other locations such as main post offices
1380274 for the next month we will be offering all new premier customers the chance to earn a very attractive ten per cent interest on their savings with the new linked premier regular saver
1380275 this will be a great way for people to kick start a savings habit and at the end of the 12 month period have saved up a nice little nest egg there has never been a better time to switch
1380276 the christmas period despite all its jollities is notoriously costly for many and with consumers failing to prepare plan and save financially for the event it can mean that their christmas is less than merry
1380277 by reviewing their basic finances consumers can make some significant savings in time for the festive period
1380278 the royal banks first home saver account is a smart way to get used to a new monthly commitment aiding financial discipline by requiring a monthly deposit into the account
1380279 the royal bank of scotland has a long tradition of providing customers throughout scotland with innovative services and we are delighted that local communities in aberdeenshire will benefit from the introduction of our new mobile banking service
1380280 as a mutual organisation principality wanted to reward loyal customers for their support and the members bond is designed to do exactly that
1380281 this is an excellent opportunity for those who not only want a great interest rate but also want to benefit from the growth potential of the stock market without any of the risks
1380282 investors simply cannot lose the rewards on offer are also greater than those with conventional savings bonds
1380283 to avoid being stung by higher winter bills and to protect savings we would advise britons to revisit their bills from previous years so that they can make the necessary financial provisions for these expenses
1380284 the run up to christmas and the onset of winter is often an expensive time of the year and prior planning can help us keep our savings intact
1380285 our customers will benefit enormously from the new design allowing them to bank in a relaxed modern and welcoming environment
1380286 impersonation of the dead is britains fastest growing identity theft crime
1380287 thousands of families have experienced the pain of discovering their loved one has been impersonated after their death to open accounts such as credit cards and loans
1380288 the third quarter of 2007 was a period of exceptional turbulence in financial markets in investment banking our performance was significantly impacted by this extremely challenging environment however our stable businesses performed well and we reaped the benefits of some recent investments
1380289 we believe that our acquisition represents a better fit with resolution
1380290 exchange rates are volatile and notoriously difficult to predict and it may be that the expectation of a further rate cut in the usa has played a role in lowering the dollar
1380291 those who are planning to take winter breaks in the usa will be pleased to find that their pound will go further towards there christmas shopping as with many things in economics however there is a balance to be struck uk exporters looking to sell goods in the us will find that the stronger value of sterling could reduce their sales growth
1380292 we are asking ourselves if things are so different from august and do we actually have to cut rates
1380293 the bid interest is there but it looks like taking a lot more time than some people had been hoping
1380294 if current growth continues then in the next five years personal cash savings could grow to around 1 trillion we are also seeing big changes in the types of accounts favoured five years from now britains savvy savers are likely to have over a third of their cash savings in tax efficient accounts such as isas a massive increase from five years ago when just a seventh 14 were sheltered from the tax man in this way
1380295 today we have a savings paradox households appear to be stretching themselves to meet increased taxation and a general rise in the cost of living however perhaps surprisingly overall savings balances have continued to increase it seems that the pressure has fallen on pension contributions evidence suggests that people in their prime years are saving more cash with a view to funding their retirement
1380296 this alliance and leicester report shows that consumers savings needs are evolving over the last five years new savings products have become available to meet these needs particularly variations within the instant access category such as disciplined savings accounts when choosing the right account for their money we know savers use a number of information sources such best buy tables and the internet we expect these will also have to evolve to reflect the changing savings market empowering savers to make informed decisions of their own
1380297 we will be ready to pass on any interest we earn by the end of the year and we hope it proves a positive catalyst for change across the industry
1380298 the recent flurry of activity in savings accounts for pensioners is certainly a step in the right direction especially bearing in mind that many high street banks are still offering accounts paying less than the rate of inflation
1380299 however it is important that those of pensionable age dont just look at these new accounts in isolation as there are better deals available for customers regardless of age
1380300 benson brought real humour to the role of lucky and he will be truly missed by all of us at more than
1380301 unfortunately the latest findings from our index reveal that many savings accounts offer derisory returns for larger balances
1380302 indeed someone receiving the average return of 3 65 per cent on their savings of 25 000 would earn around 440 in extra interest if they received the interest rate offered on one of the most competitive accounts for balances of 1
1380303 unauthorised overdrafts are a gold mine for banks the charges they levy are way out of proportion
1380304 its especially unfair on customers who only occasionally run up a small unauthorised overdraft for a short time
1380305 we are not a perfect organisation and do make mistakes dealing with millions of forms so go over the figures with a fine tooth comb
1380306 as we approach the autumn and the nights draw in now is the time to think about ways of saving energy
1380307 for example you could save around 7 a year in lower electricity bills just by changing one light bulb to an energy efficient one
1380308 regional differences in urban spending might be caused by what economists call a selection effect
1380309 those who wish to pursue a particular lifestyle choose the city accordingly it is not that the city chooses them
1380310 some customers like to know the minute their pay cheque goes in or their mortgage payment out but they can set it up online if they wish to give them whatever information they require
1380311 a short time horizon in terms of what they are doing with money
1380312 they wanted to be able to go out to spend money without feeling guilty that they were spending joint money they also wanted to be able to treat their partners sometimes not just themselves
1380313 money acts as a useful kind of mirror for what is going on in a relationship
1380314 increased regulation and fears over financing of terrorist groups has undoubtedly boosted investment in aml measures and the banks have rightly identified transaction monitoring and training as key areas for investment
1380315 the survey shows that anti money laundering is still very much work in progress within the banking industry with plenty of work left to be done
1380316 it is nonetheless clear that banks are committed to playing their role in the war against money laundering and international terror and also that they want their role to be effective
1380317 this is all about transparency enabling and empowering consumers to make informed choices
1380318 banks have been contacting customers about the scheme for some time but the message does not seem to be getting through
1380319 with nearly 4 000 per second expected to be withdrawn from atms this bank holiday weekend our advice to people is stay vigilant when withdrawing money
1380320 regularly check their statements to detect signs of fraud early on at which point they should let their banks know immediately
1380321 this shows that the chequebook is still valued by the uk saver
1380322 it is seen as a trusted and secure way of paying for goods or services even by todays hi tech investors
1380323 what is remarkable is that 85 per cent of people go to their high street provider for a savings account rather than shopping around for the best interest rate
1380324 some high street accounts pay less than 1 per cent interest yet simply to stand still against the retail prices index they should be getting 2 88 per cent taking tax into account
1380325 some of the things the children said are really funny however there is a serious point which has come through
1380326 this is a worrying statistic considering that during this period a massive 11 000 machines have been installed that charge between 1 25 and 1 50 per withdrawal
1380327 we estimate that the british public now pays nearly 6 million a month for withdrawing their own money from cash machines without being aware until the last minute that they will face a fee
1380328 weve campaigned long and hard on this issue initially meeting a brick wall
1380329 we are therefore pleased that a number of other financial organisations are now taking a more responsible view on the charging issue
1380330 many people believe that complaining wont change anything and that the bank does not care
1380331 in the past 20 years banks have gone from being customer centric to product centric now they are realising that they cant grow by taking over companies and acquiring new customers instead they have to grow by selling more to their existing customer base
1380332 up to 89 per cent of those dissatisfied with the way their complaint was handled say they are unlikely to consider the bank for future purchases
1380333 its not going to have a huge positive impact on the housing market
1380334 the factors driving the slowdown are the weakness of the labour market and less speculative behaviour in the south east
1380335 the banks forecasts suggest a slowing down in house price growth to zero over the coming year and although we expect to see positive growth continue we firmly believe that the housing market is achieving a natural slowdown
1380336 with so much competition in the current account market it is time people tackled their finances and switched to a better deal
1380337 with better deals on the market it is surprising that many more people havent relegated the big four
1380338 at alliance amp leicester we believe in rewarding our customers for banking with us and the free extra benefits of premier ensures our customers are always top of the league
1380339 this is a worrying statistic considering that during this period a massive 11 000 machines have been installed that charge between 1 25 and 1 50 per withdrawal
1380340 we estimate that the british public now pays nearly 6 million a month for withdrawing their own money from cash machines without being aware until the last minute that they will face a fee
1380341 weve campaigned long and hard on this issue initially meeting a brick wall
1380342 we are therefore pleased that a number of other financial organisations are now taking a more responsible view on the charging issue
1380343 as our research shows despite many people using their overdraft facility to manage the ups and downs in their finances they are needlessly paying higher rates of interest
1380344 this is a time when people will often come to rely more heavily on their savings
1380345 they will be seeking the security of a product that will make their savings work hard whilst generating a regular income
1380346 the account includes a 0 65 per cent bonus for the first six months and although it can be opened with a deposit as little as 1 it is primarily designed for high deposit savers looking for a short term high interest return
1380347 while 25 years ago 1million would have been more than enough to comfortably live the millionaires lifestyle a few times over today it will only afford a small portion of the trappings
1380348 as more and more people go online to shop and manage their finances cyber criminals become cleverer at finding ways to relieve us of our personal information and our hard earned cash
1380349 i wonder if people take this into account when they plan their finances my suspicion is that they dont because it is not seen as one of the big set costs like a mortgage or bills or food
1380350 however we can see that people spend a significant amount of money on it
1380351 fraudsters are becoming increasingly cunning with their tactics and theres no hiding the fact that fraud is on the increase
1380352 the trial of the access code device is one of a number of security initiatives we are introducing to address the concerns of customers and stay ahead in the battle against online fraudsters
1380353 what students may not realise is that the post office offers a fee free cash withdrawal service that lets you withdraw exact amounts rather than rounding up to the nearest 10 a useful budgeting tool that could help to manage finances throughout the year
1380354 plastic is clearly the choice of the uk consumer when it comes to spending but our egg money research clearly indicates that the increasingly complex nature of our finances means it is often hard to keep track of how much we are spending
1380355 if parents wish to give their child the best start in life its vital that they begin saving early
1380356 according to the research it would seem that a happier home life may be achieved if a good lifestyle is balanced with being in control of money matters so arguments are least likely
1380357 those who have not struck a balance between diet and exercise and money worries would appear to argue the most
1380358 our online saver accounts have proved to be extremely popular we believe customers like the convenience of managing their savings online
1380359 online saver issue two is already very competitive and with this added bonus it now offers a market leading rate
1380360 being able to live without worrying about bills and being able to buy things without worrying how they will pay for it were the things most people cited as key to financial contentment
1380361 encouragingly 40 per cent of people say they would save for their future financial contentment
1380362 the guaranteed income bond continues to be incredibly popular and from our conversations with customers seems ideal for retired people looking to draw income from their savings
1380363 with the potential for interest rates to fall further the guaranteed income bond gives people the opportunity to secure a fixed income which for the annual income option is above the current base rate for the next four years
1380364 there is no dividend income as there would be from investing directly in shares
1380365 there is no flexibility you cannot move your money around and you may be pushed out at the wrong time
1380366 va sviluppata una visione di insieme portata avanti dal centro destra in questo momento ferma se il piano di discussione e il futuro della citta ha continuato de matteis noi siamo pronti a discutere con il sindaco cialente e con la sua giunta ma limportante e che si discuta su un piano strategico di sviluppo delle opere pubbliche reali che vanno dal gran sasso alla viabilita tralasciando le piccole questioni

1380368 hamdan was al qaeda every fact in this case points to that
1380369 mr hamdan is not an al qaeda warrior he is not last line of defence
1380370 we have yet to see any confirmation from the financial services customers that they are going back to spending
1380371 this example is yet another illustration of how encapsulation may help you to avoid potential errors caused by multiple declarations of member variables with the same name in the inheritance hierarchy if needed we still can access the superclass variable greeting from the class b by using super getgreeting
1380372 the capability to do this is required or else behaviours of parent classes are not encapsulated
1380373 it is the type of the object not the type of the pointer that determines the behaviour to me that makes it a fault rather than a feature
1380374 only the java platform is pervasive enough to allow developers to build and deploy rias across desktops and browsers on more than 800 million pcs as well as billions of mobile phones and devices
1380375 if they had been conceived though ivf we would have been happy to discuss it
1380376 but we have been fortunate never to have had fertility problems
1380377 i recently had a radio gig with natasha bedingfield and we were backstage and we were talking and we swapped numbers
1380378 i was like lets get together and write something lets do something lets go to the studio and jam
1380379 she was down i would love to do something with her shes an amazing vocalist
1380380 they showed me some footage but i dont have a feel for the movie i didnt see enough i wasnt sure who the terminator was i dont know if there is one or if hes the star or the hero these are the things that determine the success and how strong the movie will be
1380381 i hope it is a huge hit i do hope it creates a spectacle on the screen that is what james cameron original terminator director created
1380382 when terminator salvation comes out i wont be sitting there saying why cant i do that i hope it makes a lot of money and is very successful
1380383 im not going to be happy until you say it
1380384 you should know how i feel ive given you enough
1380385 you should know me and trust me dont doubt anything
1380386 it felt a bit odd to be a guest in this phenomenon but it was enjoyable too becoming a part of this world that is so well established and to watch david and gillian portray this iconic couple mulder and scully was extraordinary
1380387 i should have suspected something when before production began director chris carter asked me if i was fit could i run in the snow now i had given birth eight months earlier and i hadnt exactly been running any marathons but of course i told chris yeah im in shape and the first four days of filming had me running running and running and hoping i would look cool

1380396 well you can say that im the one curly fry in the box of the regular
1380397 the fact is we can using existing facilities expand our oil production within months according to these executives
1380398 if this voluntary offer doesnt result in a sufficient number of volunteers or if in the future economic conditions worsen it may be necessary to consider layoffs
1380399 without a sale it is even possible that bmn would be dismantled altogether which would put all of bmns employees including the unions members out of work bmn its employees and the communities it serves will be severely harmed if this happens due to the loss of jobs and three local newspapers
1380400 it does lay out an extreme case of what could happen if eventually a sale were not made but certainly there is not any indication in this filing nor is it accurate that the newspapers going to be closed down next week or next month
1380401 it is a possibility that this could happen if over time we were not able to get a sale and business conditions continue to deteriorate

1380405 i have to do this as mothers who give up never find their children
1380406 i never thought that something bad would happen to my child because i see nothing wrong with her being an activist helping the people who were not familiar with the laws and the benefits they should be receiving to me this constitutes helping the government but the government obviously thinks otherwise
1380407 i really need to remain active so the international community our local media even the authorities and the perpetrators know that i know where my daughter is the military is holding her and it is the militarys responsibility to help me find my daughter
1380408 there was an increase in activist killings in the areas where gen palparan was assigned
1380409 the only hope i am holding on right now is that i will be able to see karen soon
1380410 we are always waiting for her i will always keep on searching
1380411 i never thought my family would be a victim of a human rights violation by the government i am respected in our community as the secretary of the homeowners association when the head is not available people come to me and so i never had any inkling that we had a problem with the authorities
1380412 when i imagine how they tortured my daughter my anger with the government boils up as i expect them to protect and serve the people as mandated by our constitution

1380430 i think we made it a little harder on ourselves by not moving the ball around as much
1380431 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1380432 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1380433 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1380434 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1380435 we cant have those type of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1380436 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people
1380437 i think to come into a game intimidated youve given up before you start and we didnt feel like we did that tonight
1380438 i drive about 35 miles round trip to work every day so this recycle made a good deal on my gas tank

1380441 just as were speaking a pickup truck is coming across our scale with some farm equipment and some old barbed wire fence
1380442 they get money here and they supplement their income and pay for their food and their fuel and their rent and everything else
1380443 a year or two ago im sure i would have probably just went out to dinner or maybe even went to the movies or something to that effect rather than filling up my tank
1380444 it used to all be for my kids now i use some to pay for gas
1380445 theres a lot of 80 year old farm stuff in the fields from what ive seen people drag in
1380446 we have real collectors with 200 pounds and the little grandmother bringing them down in the back of her cadillac five pounds at a time

1380460 our officials will go to beijing we will definitely implement all good lessons learnt from the beijing olympics however let me say that we are very much on track for the commonwealth games thanks to the asiad in 1982 delhi already has a solid infrastructure for sports in place these are being refurbished delhis overall infrastructure is also being upgraded with a deadline of 2010 in addition to better metro connectivity we will have 5 000 to 6 000 modern buses plying in the city by then
1380461 today most of delhis infrastructure projects whether its the modernisation of the airport construction of metro link to the airport or the games village all are linked to the games its a global phenomenon such big sports events act as a stimulus for fast track completion of mega infrastructure projects overcoming routine political and bureaucratic hurdles
1380462 i think a lot of people are watching to see whether we will succeed

1380505 this is not a democratic issue or a republican issue it is an issue that affects all of us i am committed to working with all of my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to resolve the energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to act now
1380506 i think for obama the problem is drilling and is alienating environmental activists for mccain the problem is alienating anti tax advocates who are already sort of frustrated with him on some level
1380507 we have to drill here and drill now not wait and see whether theres areas to explore not wait and see whether theres a package that needs to be put together but drill here and drill now
1380508 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1380509 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since theres so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil

1380536 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1380537 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1380538 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1380539 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1380540 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1380541 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1380542 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1380543 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1380544 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1380545 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner

1380550 nearly every college coach was teary eyed when i finished telling it
1380551 it took a 16 year old young man to take charge of a sensitive day
1380552 id want someone to stand up to speak if it were my family i spoke for the team i made sure coach quinlan understood the cy ridge football team had his back coach needed to know we were there for him
1380553 your husband must have been a heckuva person because you raised a great man our coach hes in a better place now
1380554 we were all hurting and what he said really opened my eyes it really took guts to speak about someone you never met but thats russell he has many fans in our family it was a huge deal
1380555 russell always steps up and says the right thing he leads by example sometimes by actions and usually deflects the praise heaped upon himself to his teammates thats the sign of a true leader
1380556 who wouldnt want to be thought of as the no 1 player
1380557 itll only push me harder to become a more complete player
1380558 shepard is a rare athlete who resembles university of florida receiver percy harvin when lined up at quarterback a scary thought shepard is lean flexible and plays with a lot of wiggle he might seem like just a great athlete playing quarterback at first but hes the real deal as a complete player still he makes most of his plays with his legs either on called runs or on scrambles after the initial play unravels he causes headaches for defenses because he can break down a defender in the open amp shepard is much further along as a passer than terrelle pryor of ohio state was at this stage and shepard is more explosive
1380559 when the defense commits too many men to the interior box he goes through his progressions to find one of the four wide receivers if they commit to the outside it only opens the running lanes
1380560 he takes charge once he steps in the huddle and is a cerebral player i respect his knowledge of the game and read its a great partnership
1380561 i told them we could make this a special class
1380562 i do my research on each player introduce myself and then tell them why theyd be important to the lsu recruiting class i know what theyre going through this could be a dream team
1380563 all ive ever asked is to have a chance at starting as a true freshman
1380564 if i dont start at quarterback then ill switch to another position like wide receiver i dont plan on redshirting

1380567 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1380568 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1380569 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be
1380570 if he is i might go see him when im done here

1380894 nowadays a lot of these companies get these guys off the street many of them desperate for an early payday clean them up use them for a shoot give them a hundred dollars and then throw them back where you have internet based setups like cocoboys com and cocodrom com featuring very young performers who the company has no interest in promoting or building up into stars or even names theyre just a parade of cute pliable youngsters in need of a quick buck who think spending a couple of weeks in the dorm will be a quick way of making some money all the while getting drawn into unsafe sex practices by an unscrupulous management
1380895 the cocodorm models practice safe sex its funny that someone who has never been or participated in the dorm life could say such things whats your reaction
1380896 when i saw tiger tyson and the other guys in person the first thing that struck me was that they were all small anyway tiger tyson and the rest of them looked rough with bad skin and then i looked down and saw that they were dancing in dirty tennis shoes their choreography was nothing and they just came across to me and the crowd as tacky looking and unprofessional
1380897 bobby you look better in person than you do from you box covers
1380898 i dont like gay marriage being pushed as a political agenda its extremely unpopular among the wider african community as an african american i dont like be pressured to sign up to any agenda by a gay rights movement that has been predominantly white and has historically shown next to no interest in the rights of black gay men and women and for myself i feel there are more important issues that need sorting out first the seemingly deep rooted inability of gay men particularly black gay men to commit to each other

1381216 this new certificate will have the same value as the normal hsc
1381217 it has a direct linkage with the world of work in that it includes a placement program for the students encourages entrepreneurship and allows a clear focus on a professional line that a student could opt for
1381218 it would offer an attractive work appeal package and reduce the mismatch of work requirements and aptitudes of those joining the work environment

1381231 previously a lot of people would experience problems because of a lack of standards but that was a few years back

1381234 we can now provide high quality dvr capabilities to almost all of our customers in a very short period of time
1381235 it changes cables competitive posture against satellite it makes the services less expensive to provide and it makes it easier to upgrade the services
1381236 cablevision has been innovative here and i think other cable companies will follow them
1381237 in short order effective dvr penetration could now jump to north of 60 percent of cable households that is all digital cable subscribers
1381238 that means a huge increase in the number of viewing hours per day potentially subject to ad skipping
1381239 it allows advertisers to do things they cant do on a physical dvr
1381240 lets say you record an episode of lost three months later you want to play it back the advertising that was on lost is stale and no longer applies but the capability to refresh the advertising exists if the content owner wants to do that with the cable operator
1381241 it really makes sense because of the way the landscape has been evolving

1381262 these preliminary data are released upon our being advised that the trial has now reached the point at which more than 50 of the patients have died the overall survival os and disease control rate dcr for patients receiving nimotuzumab compare well with published results in similar patient populations treated with cetuximab a currently marketed egfr monoclonal antibody nimotuzumab also continues to display a safety profile unequalled in its class this low incidence of toxicity with nimotuzumab may be related to differences reported in its interaction with egf receptors compared with other egfr targeting antibodies
1381263 the median overall survival of 9 3 months and disease control rate of 50 together with the exceptional safety profile of nimotuzumab support continuing development of nimotuzumab in patients with colorectal cancer
1381264 the results support further development of nimotuzumab in this setting and trials in metastatic colorectal cancer are high on the list of indications that ym and its licensees plan to develop initially however ym will concentrate on those indications where nimotuzumab can complete pivotal trials in the shortest time within its available resources we intend to file for registration trials in 2008 for patients with non small cell lung cancer nsclc and for those with brain metastases because of compelling observations in phase ii trials in those indications and because they require shorter development times than colorectal trials would require

1381269 many of these restaurants have the nutrition information online that you can print out and go over with your kids even before you go so that everybody is on the same page before they pull up to the drive through or head to the counter
1381270 instead of getting the fries go with the apple slices many restaurants offer carrot sticks or apple slices or no sugar added applesauce or oranges which make a big difference over deep fried fries
1381271 instead of the deep fried nuggets go for something like the grilled chicken and you will save fat grams and calories

1381431 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1381432 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go

1381466 equipment transponder leasing and digital broadcast operation costs may increase beyond our current expectations
1381467 we may be unable to renew agreements for these services on acceptable terms or at all echostars inability to develop and produce or our inability to obtain equipment with the latest technology or our inability to obtain transponder capacity and digital broadcast operations and other services from third parties could affect our subscriber acquisition and churn and cause related revenue to decline
1381468 our ability to maintain or grow our subscriber base will be adversely affected if we do not enter into a new agreement with at amp t and we are not able to develop comparable alternative distribution channels
1381469 if we and echostar are unsuccessful in our appeal to the united states supreme court in the tivo case or in defending against tivos motion for contempt or any subsequent claims that echostars alternative technology infringes tivos patent we could be prohibited from distributing dvrs supplied to us by echostar or be required to modify or eliminate certain user friendly dvr features that we currently offer to consumers
1381470 in that event we would be at a significant disadvantage to our competitors who could offer this functionality and while we would attempt to provide that functionality using different technology and or manufacturers other than echostar the adverse affect on our business could be material we could also have to pay substantial additional damages

1381485 1968 foi antes de mais nada um ano de revolta estudantil e juvenil numa onda que atingiu pa ses de naturezas sociais e estruturas t o diferentes como egito estados unidos pol nia o denominador comum uma revolta contra a autoridade do estado e da fam lia
1381486 1968 se mostrou uma revolu o subterr nea que reformou as pequenas esferas do trabalho da fam lia e da escola transformou nossa maneira de falar de sentir foi uma verdadeira libera o dos costumes maio de 68 marcou o in cio da p s modernidade
1381487 em 1968 ou jovens eram muito agressivos e respondiam n o confie em ningu m com mais de 30 anos havia uma certa utopia ing nua ao achar que as drogas poderiam ser instrumento de abertura das consci ncias mas essa realidade se mostrou perversa
1381488 o legado do maio de 68 imp s a id ia de que n o existia mais qualquer diferen a entre bom e mau verdade e falsidade beleza e fei ra sua heran a introduziu o cinismo na sociedade e na pol tica
1381489 o que o fundamental maio de 1968 desencadeou entre os jovens foi uma ades o a valores e causas estranhas aos seus pais e av s marcados pelas circunst ncias de duas guerras mundiais que abriram e fecharam a maior crise capitalista
1381490 em maio de 1968 tomou se a palavra como tomou se a bastilha em 1789
1381491 os eventos do maio de 68 na fran a podem ser interpretados como o estopim de uma s rie de transforma es pol ticas e comportamentais ocorridas na segunda metade do s culo 20 e que tiveram como eixos centrais o desejo de liberdade a busca de prazer sem limite a recusa de qualquer forma de controle e de autoridade e a defesa da igualdade entre homens e mulheres para os jovens estudantes franceses do maio de 68 liberdade felicidade e prazer eram elementos insepar veis de uma revolu o cujo lema era proibido proibir

1381493 maio de 68 tornou se retrospectivamente o movimento de uma juventude impaciente para gozar todas as promessas do livre consumo do sexo e das mercadorias o movimento de 1968 depois de ser reduzido a transbordamentos da juventude sem conseq ncia para a ordem social viu se carregado ao inverso de um peso hist rico desastroso ao transformar a sociedade inteira em uma agrega o de consumidores narcisistas desligados de qualquer elo social ele garantiu o triunfo definitivo do mercado capitalista maio de 68 estava consagrado como o providencial salvador do capitalismo
1381494 os eventos explosivos vis veis de 1968 foram em ltima inst ncia o resultado de um desequil brio estrutural a passagem de uma forma de domina o para outra o que sobreviveu da liberta o sexual dos anos 1960 foi o hedonismo tolerante facilmente incorporado a nossa ideologia hegem nica hoje o prazer sexual n o apenas permitido ordenado os indiv duos se sentem culpados quando n o podem desfrut lo
1381495 em maio de 1968 n o conhec amos a aids nem degrada es clim ticas nem prova es da globaliza o do desemprego ramos promet icos tudo parecia poss vel o futuro nos pertencia muito mais angustiante ser jovem hoje do que h 40 anos mas quem tem vontade de se revoltar se revolta em todo caso 1968 n o deve ser visto como modelo retenham simplesmente que existem momentos hist ricos em que alguma coisa explode um desejo de fazer avan ar de transformar a sociedade e que isso pode funcionar

1381583 i anticipate there will still be problems with pollution and i expect to be chasing stories on that during the games and i think they will have huge problems with security and possible discontent
1381584 we live on the 30th floor of a highrise and we have a little pollution index
1381585 if i can see the mountain in the distance its a fabulous day if i can see the buildings that are about 600m away its not too bad and if i cant see the building right next to ours its a bad day we havent seen the mountains for weeks
1381586 we all thought that when they took the cars off the roads and closed the factories there would be beautiful blue skies and everyone would come here and think we have been a bunch of whiners for saying how bad its been

1381591 this country might be 5000 years old but in its present form right now its incredibly naive and immature
1381592 we saw it during the protests around the torch relay darfur tibet and human rights they take everything as a personal attack
1381593 there is no dialogue no debate they think that anyone who criticises china or protests against china is anti china that they are china bashing its like having an argument with a 14 year old theres not a lot of room for reasoning
1381594 i was the subject of death threats for more than a month during the torch relay when he covered the protests for cnn i was vilified on the internet it never ended but i didnt worry about the death threats too much theyre in chinese and i dont read chinese so i just ignored them when they start sending them in english i will be worried

1381611 israel displayed an excellent ear and fine false turn of phrase during the 15 or so months in the early 1990s when she sold hundreds of phony celebrity letters and a lot of filched real ones to about 30 different dealers now all these years later shes written a slender sordid and pretty damned fabulous book about her misadventures if i were a librarian i wouldnt let lee israel through the door but id certainly make sure i had her latest book on the shelves if i were an editor id sign her up to write a biography of louise brooks and not just to keep her out of trouble
1381612 the effect of this book on me was to make me like ammon shea and briefly to hate english what a choking god awful mash it is surely french is better then i recovered and saw its greatness afresh the o e d shea notes is a catalog of the foibles of the human condition shea has walked the wildwood of our gnarled ancient speech and returned singing incomprehensible sounds in a language that turns out to be our own
1381613 doris lessing once declared that fiction makes a better job of the truth than straightforward reminiscence and while that might well be true of her celebrated and semi autobiographical martha quest novels its an observation that doesnt apply at all to her latest book alfred amp emily an intriguing work that is half fiction half memoir the sketchy insubstantial first half of the book imagines what her parents lives might have been like if world war i had never occurred the potent and harrowing second half recounts the real life story of her parents and the incalculable ways in which the war fractured their dreams and psyches and left them stranded in the bush in africa eking out a meager existence on a tiny farm in rhodesia
1381614 brenda wineapple brings a scholars diligence and a novelists imagination to her account of dickinson and higginsons relationship crafting a tour de force that should delight specialists and casual readers alike the books individual strands of inquiry higginsons life dickinsons poems the letters that passed between them and the historical political and artistic contexts of the age are interesting in and of themselves but when intertwined so as to inform and strengthen each other theyre fascinating
1381615 a good and happy child is so well done that part of me wishes i had missed it i like to sleep soundly at night
1381616 this sly and discombobulating flight of whimsy by david deans is in a sense a book length joke and nothing drains the humor from a good joke as effectively as vivisecting it has comenius hallucinated his transformation and if so where did he acquire his knowledge of kafka and rilke of orpheus and lady macbeth is bob a good guy after all is he even out of town let alone in mexico and where is miss scarlett anyway mr deans may or may not provide the answers to these queries but the readers irresistible desire to know is evidence that hes pulled off a splendid joke
1381617 despite its specific american flavors travel writing seems most like a contemporary french novel such as those by christian oster and gregoire bouillier a book in which an atmosphere of established and almost enviable dailiness underwrites sophisticated narrative conceits truth matters less than the telling and that makes for a cool easy kind of fiction its not hemingway or borges or even dashiell hammett but its nice
1381618 have i raved enough i feel as if im barrys publicist or agent maybe shell give me a cut of the 2 million but i did love this book it didnt matter if i was in a bad mood or tired or had other things to do i wanted to read this book i wanted to be living in these characters minds hanging out in salem or on yellow dog island does the novel deserve the hype i certainly dont begrudge it
1381619 the now forgotten us immigrants to the soviet union in the early thirties were communist sympathisers or more often desperate victims of the depression at first they were feted waves of repression however ensured that they and their descendants ended up either in russias prisons or as inmates of the gulag this is a powerful important and highly readable book the gulag is no novelty but tzouliadis brilliantly links high politics to the torment of innocents adding devastating detail

1381621 it would be difficult to find any precedent in american history for the scale brutality and illegality of the torture and degradation inflicted on detainees over the last six years

1381670 the rise of online dating as a way of finding a partner may partly explain the reported reduced spend on an average date when dating on the internet people may be less likely to spend excessive amounts of money on a first date because its with someone theyve never met before going out for dinner remains a popular choice for a first date but more and more people tend to opt for lunch coffee or a drink in a bar they opt for a less pressured first date to determine if theres any chemistry before committing to spending a whole evening together
1381671 its also interesting but perhaps unsurprising that men and women alike still expect either the man to pick up the bill on a first date or for the bill to be split rather than the woman being expected to pay some may feel this is old fashioned but its far from outdated previous surveys have repeatedly shown that men rate good looks in a partner more highly than women do while women rate generosity and income of a partner more highly than men do while these distinct differences exist it seems that were a long way off from women being just as likely to pick up the bill on a first date many men still feel a need to demonstrate their generous side on a first date and figures show that many women are still impressed by this

1382055 i dont govern the anglican communion i preside and i convene and there is a sense in which i have a hand in shaping the agenda
1382056 but given the fact that the programme for this conference was very largely designed by people quite outside the european context and given the fact that some of the things we have been talking about are very much instances of partnership between the developing world and churches here i think the charge of colonialism is a bit of a red herring

1382091 the taxpayer is being forced to hand over yet more money in order to keep this bank afloat
1382092 gordon brown and alistair darling promised taxpayers the loan to northern rock would be repaid in full but now just six months after nationalisation we learn part of that loan is being written off to recapitalise the bank after these disastrous losses
1382093 once again we are seeing how this government just cant be straight with people
1382094 alistair darling assured parliament that taxpayer loans to northern rock would be fully secured on mortgage assets this is clearly not true
1382095 3 4bn of the governments loan to northern rock is now being converted into ordinary shares which rank right at the bottom for repayment continuing losses at the bank put this money at great risk
1382096 other banks have taken the cream of northern rocks mortgages leaving the rest to curdle

1382203 longstanding regulatory policies regarding the 2 5 ghz band including the encouragement of consolidation of spectrum in this band due to its historical underutilization
1382204 combining the assets of the two companies will ignite faster introduction of 2 5 ghz mobile wimax service and thus introduce new broadband competition across the country representing precisely the sort of accelerated broadband deployment that the commission hoped to encourage by overhauling the 2 5 ghz bandplan
1382205 new clearwire will also permit a number of unaffiliated firms to purchase access to its wireless broadband service on a non exclusive wholesale basis and resell that service directly to consumers in competition with new clearwire and other wireline and wireless providers
1382206 i f the fcc were to reject the request of these two companies to combine their efforts and their 2 5 ghz assets the commission would kill any hope for nationwide fixed and mobile broadband services on the 2 5 ghz spectrum
1382207 new clearwires proposal will dramatically increase digital bridges ability to achieve its own goal of providing wireless broadband services to small rural communities using wimax technology throughout the united states
1382208 is the only feasible means of achieving the synergies economies of scale and industry wide benefits inherent in a coast to coast mobile wimax network
1382209 painfully aware of the capital constraints currently facing entrepreneurial wireless broadband network operators seeking to introduce competitive broadband wireless services to american consumers and businesses
1382210 as separate companies without access to substantial capital clearwire and sprint would face high hurdles to construct their individual systems in an expeditious manner
1382211 enable ebs licensees and other educational institutions as well as their students faculty and staff to finally obtain the educational benefits made possible by 2 5 ghz based advanced wireless broadband services
1382212 stimulate the deployment of 2 5 ghz wireless broadband services on those licenses furthering ebs licensees educational missions as well as economic benefits from their spectrum leases
1382213 a pproval of the sprint clearwire transaction would promote the deployment of a new integrated nationwide broadband network within the very near future thus expediting the availability of high speed advanced broadband services to the educational community
1382214 t he greater speed mobility and reach of the network may allow us to expand the educational resources we can deliver to our communities
1382215 part of a state of the art wireless broadband network that has nationwide reach
1382216 have looked forward to the day when their ebs facilities could be employed to support the provision of 21 st century services for the use of their students faculty and administration
1382217 agrees with sprint and clearwire that an open network will spur innovation in applications and devices
1382218 wimax network should spur competition in the provision of broadband services to the home
1382219 the vigorous growth of competition in the high speed internet access market further reduces the chances that the transactions are likely to lead to violations of the principles
1382220 new clearwire will permit a number of unaffiliated firms to purchase access to its advanced wireless broadband service on a non exclusive wholesale basis and resell that service directly to consumers in competition with new clearwire and other wireline and wireless providers
1382221 the proposed transaction provide s significant public benefits such as greater access to a broader variety of services service providers and service options for a greater number of us consumers including those in rural and underserved areas
1382222 provide greater clarity and certainty regarding their intentions with respect to wholesale broadband access to the proposed new clearwire network
1382223 brs 1 should not be relegated to co primary status and that the threat of harmful interference persists
1382224 no material distinctions between ebs leases and other commercial mobile leases
1382225 inconsistent with the secondary market rules which impose no limitation and encourage flexibility and spectrum use
1382226 c hanging the technical rules of the 2 5 ghz band alone may not be enough to stimulate the capital investment necessary
1382227 no basis exists to exclude the 112 5 mhz of ebs spectrum lease rights
1382228 inherently less valuable to the commercial operator than unencumbered capacity whether or not the ebs licensee ever exercises its recapture rights
1382229 preserve existing high power operations including distance learning and other educational video programming
1382230 it is clear that spectrum not used or available to licensees should not be attributed for purposes of any spectrum screen
1382231 will not cause any competitive harm in the brs band in any specific local market
1382232 by the time sprints 2 5 ghz spectrum capacity is put to use sufficient other spectrum should be available so that no undue market power will be conferred on
1382233 significant blocks of spectrum are available or soon will be available to competitors wishing to provide competing wireless mobile broadband services
1382234 the commissions long standing regulatory policies regarding the 2 5 ghz band including the encouragement of consolidation of spectrum in this band due to its historical underutilization
1382235 g iven the number and diversity of available licenses it is unlikely
1382236 would be able to acquire enough spectrum to foreclose the broadband market to potential competitors even if it should attempt to do so
1382237 artificially manipulate a nascent product market and geographic markets that have not yet emerged
1382238 even apart from this transaction applicants have numerous options for their special access needs
1382239 commission should consider imposition of regulation when there is an identifiable market failure and imposition of the regulation would serve the public interest because it is targeted to correct that failure
1382240 in a competitive market market forces are generally sufficient to ensure the lawfulness of
1382241 new clearwires nationwide wimax network should spur competition in the provision of broadband service to the home
1382242 benefit all americans by bringing them another competitive broadband alternative choice to the current incumbent providers
1382243 the transaction will enable new clearwire to utilize the 2
1382244 this commercial ability of wimax technology will provide new opportunities for other commission licensees and wireless network operators at 2
1382245 as a well funded nationwide wimax provider however new clearwire undoubtedly would have the ability to ramp up its capital expenditures and roll out wimax services on a more aggressive timetable
1382246 capacity scale and funding necessary to deploy a nationwide mobile wireless broadband network
1382247 new clearwire will have the capacity scale and money necessary to unleash the promise of the historically underutilized 2
1382248 t he new clearwire proposal would minimize the number of adjacent service area boundaries that otherwise require resource intensive coordination and accommodation
1382249 in our opinion it doesnt make sense to build two totally new wimax networks
1382250 u nless they combine their spectrum assets infrastructure and expertise neither sprint nor clearwire alone would be able to provide ebs licensees with high speed broadband access advanced broadband services or a nationwide mobile broadband network any time in the near future
1382251 the combination of these assets and this significant investment will promote the deployment of an advanced nationwide wireless network in the 2
1382252 the ebs license that colorado public television leased to sprint enables cpt the financial freedom to offer more quality programming to our community
1382253 ebs licensees need a viable commercial partner capable of deploying new technologies and being a strong partner with the ebs community
1382254 these capabilities will dramatically enhance the ways that students faculty and surrounding communities access the internet combining mobility and speed with access anytime and anywhere whether at home at school or on the road
1382255 will extend the reach accessibility and functionality of stanfords professional course offering and enhance stanfords distant education programs

1382262 what the at amp t purchase of aloha spectrum suggests

1382271 at amp t tries to block clearwire betraying nerves about mobile broadband
1382272 at amp t will be well aware that the new clearwire represents a greater competitive threat than the wounded sprint on its own
1382273 will only be true if the merger can be achieved quickly and without significant watering down of the agreed terms

1382407 if the relationship is something that you would like to become meaningful and lasting then why wouldnt you share who you are with this person there is no way to determine how hed react but his feelings are really not the issue the issue is how you feel about do you want to keep it hidden what if an ex girlfriend shows up on your doorstep

1382485 will then purchase the remaining interest from bertelsmann for approximately 600 million as a result bertelsmann will receive approximately 900 million in value for its 50 percent stake plus 300 million of its share of cash on sony bmgs balance sheet
1382486 this move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas
1382487 sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential

1382489 with regards to internet access there appears to have been last minute progress achieved
1382490 however there has been considerable damage done to us and in my part of the world what was somebody elses problem has become ours
1382491 this should not have been in the glare of press discussions in august 2008 as we have all known that this could be a problem ever since
1382492 this turned into our problem when it shouldnt have been
1382493 however the other day i was asked would i apologise and i said i would not apologise as the ioc do not run the internet in china
1382494 there will be though a review of what happened when we come to audit the games when they are over
1382495 the uncertainties have been resolved but there has been a lack of clarity from our point of view and i take responsibility for that
1382496 obviously some sites would not have been suitable such as pornographic subversive or those acting against the national interests
1382497 when we acquired the atc building we were not expecting to find something of such historical significance so it was exciting to find the flight simulator
1382498 i believe it is one of a very small number of ww2 flight simulators left in scotland and what makes it even rarer is its excellent condition
1382499 i am glad that we are able to help the atc preserve the device and move it to its new home in montrose where it will eventually go on display to the public to be enjoyed by generations to come
1382500 the simulator was discovered after the building was sold on to make way for the new tram system in edinburgh
1382501 it looks like the simulator was made around 1940 and we still have the complete original manual to refer to its a wonderful piece of machinery and is still in very very good condition
1382502 it is almost completely intact apart from a few valves and the plotting table but they should be easily fixable
1382503 hopefully in time everyone will be able to go and see the simulator in full working order
1382504 while it was slightly better than expected it is still obviously weak it is still below 50 it has been below 50 for five out of seven months it doesnt really show any improvement in the economy
1382505 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy

1382512 the political reality of southern xinjiang is that uighurs dont see themselves as chinese
1382513 it may be that as many as a couple of hundred have been killed by separatists alone since the early 90s and of course people have been executed or killed in police raids
1382514 what we have documented in the past is a much broader crackdown particularly after september 11 and the global war on terror
1382515 its the only place in china where political prisoners are regularly sentenced to death and executed
1382516 only a very small number of sabotage activities and many were nipped in the bud
1382517 claims of plots have never been completely made up but have probably often been exaggerated and misrepresented at least from around 2002 until recently
1382518 there are quite a few groups and the chinese usually lump them all together as etim
1382519 most of those previous groups have identified themselves as uighur separatists not as part of the wider islamist terrorist agenda
1382520 can we hold these disparate views and still respect each other and stay together or do we need to go separate ways

1382570 weve had talks and the premier league is the one were after we want to get that back
1382571 and over the course of the season to show that consistency and get that back off man utd would be fantastic
1382572 they have had two good years and you have to stand back and take your hat off to them but we know we were good last year and we have another level to go to
1382573 last year i think we saw the very best of man utd but we have got an awful lot to come from last year
1382574 we have got improvements to make but i think man utd are at their peak
1382575 the premier league is the one we want and when the champions league starts again its going to be exciting
1382576 the worst part is over and i have had a lot of difficulties to overcome since the beginning but right now i am very happy with the progress i am making
1382577 that is thanks to the help i have had and i am just waiting for the moment when i am ready to play again

1382619 let us open up our doors for writers the way that so many not only in brooklyn but across the country have done for musicians check out www dodiyusa org for an idea the internet and its social networking sites have made the promotion of independent arts events not only extremely easy but extremely cheap if not altogether free if we as readers become the curators of our own literary events we take the power out of the hands of publicists and publishers with bookselling agendas and create a more organic experience furthermore by hosting readings and performances outside of bars we open doors to the under 21 crowd which has a great literary energy but little access to events outside of the undergrad sphere

1382625 we have had a request for a 40 percent increase in fees from our referees
1382626 they put forward three comparators they wanted us to base our decision on and there was no written support for that
1382627 they recognised that there is a need for a detailed review and study and yesterday we proposed how that might be done and today we are meeting to chart the way forward
1382628 things i think are moving in absolutely the right direction
1382629 i should say that since the spl started our referees have had an increase in the fee of 140 percent and our income has not increased anywhere like that level
1382630 but i think we are at the position with our referee colleagues that we have to get back to business as usual

1382641 picking a favourite stewart bale photograph is not an easy task metropolis capturing modern liverpool i spent time as part of the project team weighing up the merits of many of bales photographs we searched the archive for striking images that best portrayed liverpool as a developing modern metropolis a reflection of the city today the most difficult part was choosing only 60 abbey cinema exterior is a stunning photograph much more hollywood than wavertree by taking the image at night the photographer could exploit the buildings illuminated architecture you can see why we chose this as an image to enlarge for the exhibition crowds at the launch of mauretania ii the launch of a ship was obviously a very popular event in those days something we no longer experience the amount of detail in the photograph is exceptional take a look at the extent people will go to for a good view some are perched on top of shed roofs and cars whilst other dare devils cling to steel work that brings me to my favourite metropolis image it is not a highly iconic shot and does not depict a famous event or landmark architecture it is anglia vans on the assembly line obviously ford played an important role in liverpools history and the image shows cutting edge technology of the time but my reason for picking it is much more personal we always wanted to include never seen before images from the bale archive in the exhibition not an easy task considering that our film negatives are frozen to stop them deteriorating see how have the photographs survived for more detail using the order books from the bale company combined with documentation from the storage process we were able to pinpoint a box out of just over 1300 that contained images commissioned by ford we had no idea what they would look like however the box was removed from its freezer and transferred to an insulated bag where it would defrost at a slow rate twenty four hours later after removing the protective packaging layers i had a bundle of film negatives its so thrilling to be the first person to look at these images since they were originally commissioned you just never know what you may find as you look through them on the light box the anticipation builds and you fear the image you are hoping for isnt there then in a eureka moment it appears the image stood out instantly as fitting the metropolis theme and had all of the expected high qualities of a stewart bale work its composition is striking with the assembly belt giving a great line of perspective not only is it satisfying to have brought this image into public view but i also see it as a symbol of how much hidden potential the stewart bale archive has nmls long term aim is to digitise the stewart bale collection to allow the public to view them more easily
1382642 when i was pregnant with my daughter frankie i had all kinds of questions including ones about immunization there is a wealth of misinformation about vaccines out there particularly in hollywood
1382643 my husband and i took the time to speak to several doctors about our concerns what became clear to us was that delaying vaccines could jeopardize our babys life i have teamed up with every child by two to help parents get the facts straight on this very important issue
1382644 my main message to parents is that they should not be taking medical advice from me or any other celebrity they should look to their pediatrician the aap and other experts

1382646 i jumped at the chance to see him in concert and managed to squeeze into the fifth row of the packed nightclub to gaze up at his thick hands laying that pulsing tremolo over those bo diddley chords on that beautiful box shaped guitar bo diddley was pretty old in 1987 but he wasnt too old to snarl his lyrics or to enjoy himself

1382666 at the same time we were able to make some crucial investments to grow our economy
1382667 one occupant was thrown from the vehicle and is currently at royal columbian hospital with unknown injuries
1382668 the second occupant of the vehicle was trapped and died as a result of his injuries at the scene
1382669 i dont like that he has been criticized thats for sure
1382670 i dont think its fair i think hes giving me a legitimate shot to show him what talent i have and what kind of product he actually has here i want to try my best to show him that im a major league calibre pitcher
1382671 it hurts team canada at the moment but they have a lot of great pitchers a lot of great guys
1382672 its not like i was the catalyst or the backbone of that team
1382673 youre backing down from something you worked hard for ive never seen you do that before

1382678 the insolvency crisis will come to an end only as home prices in the us begin to stabilise and clarify the level of equity in homes the ultimate collateral support for much of the financial worlds mortgage backed securities
1382679 with oil prices beginning to soften there may be a chance for them to give a boost to the economy by lowering rates again
1382680 it think its still in the cards but no one really knows
1382681 i think it would be premature for the fed to ease rates further the fed has used new mechanisms including the term auction facility and the term securities lending facility to help maintain financial system liquidity and the orderly function of markets and so as long as no further stress events occur in the credit markets i think they should stand pat on rates
1382682 the fed needs more data before it can reach an informed reasonable decision on interest rate direction
1382683 i know there are some fed members who would love to raise rates but that would not be wise given the weak u s economy on the other hand im sure there are fed board members whod love to cut rates as well but theyll have a tough case to make against the hawks given trending higher inflation
1382684 may give the fed some room to lower rates in the fall if inflation pressures ease in tandem with lower oil prices
1382685 right now mobius is a little premature in calling for a 1 rate
1382686 if theres one sector that stands to benefit handsomely from a further slide in oil or at least a moderation in crudes rally the airlines
1382687 airlines may make a terrible long term investment but can be an outstanding short term trade
1382688 some investors will rightfully cringe from any mention of this sector after all the airlines have consistently lost money throughout their post deregulation history
1382689 most of the majors have declared bankruptcy on multiple occasions since that time however weve traded the airlines on a few occasions we took some triple digit percentage gains in the airlines back in 2005
1382690 the airlines leverage to oil prices is well known expectations are so low in fact that several major air carriers actually managed to beat consensus expectations in the second quarter
1382691 and although sentiment is already at rock bottom theres a real basis for cautious optimism first if im right about oil fuel costs wont rise appreciably in the third quarter this huge headwind is dissipating
1382692 meanwhile the major carriers are finally taking real steps to address pathetic profitability the most important step is capacity rationalization and restructuring the air carriers are retiring older planes and permanently ending service for certain routes
1382693 the us airline industry has too many planes flying over too many routes there just arent enough passengers to make this model profitable reducing capacity lowers operating costs and brings service in line with passenger volumes
1382694 and anyone whos flown recently knows the major air carriers are all instituting extra fees and charges including checked baggage fees and a few extra dollars for that bloody mary on your flight home from las vegas
1382695 airlines are also replacing inefficient decades old airplanes with newer more fuel efficient planes such as the boeing 787 dreamliner
1382696 my two favorite airlines for a trade are us airways and delta air lines delta reported a 1 billion loss in the second quarter but that includes a 1 1 billion noncash accounting charge known as goodwill impairment if we net that out delta actually posted a small profit
1382697 quite frankly thats amazing given the more than 100 jump in fuel costs the carrier has experienced over the past year
1382698 delta is aggressively cutting costs and reducing capacity the companys debt is 2 42 times its equity for almost any business that would be considered pathetic except for the airlines
1382699 delta has 1 billion in undrawn capacity on its credit lines and 3 3 billion in unrestricted cash the company isnt going bankrupt any time soon
1382700 delta is also in the process of merging with northwest airlines
1382701 please be advised that buying airlines is extremely risky you should only take this trade if youre willing to assume a far higher than average risk and are ready to treat it as a trade not an investment
1382702 for the even more adventurous theres us airways like delta you could argue that us airways was actually profitable or close to it in the second quarter if we exclude noncash charges us airways will also benefit from lower fuel costs and sharply falling capacity

1382751 a focus on compensating investors presents the danger that the sec may give undue emphasis to the possibility of obtaining a large settlement in its selection of enforcement actions

1382754 disgorgement is primarily concerned with recouping ill gotten gains from the defendant as a disincentive to committing fraud it is not a compensatory remedy for fraud victims in order to be equitable disgorgement should be calculated as the defendants gain which may not equal the loss suffered by fraud victims

1382764 human induced climate change and its impacts are apparent now throughout the united states global warming is unequivocal and is due primarily to human induced emissions of heat trapping gases and other pollutants
1382765 regional variations in radiative forcing may have important regional and global climatic implications that are not resolved by the concept of global mean radiative forcing regional diabatic heating can also cause atmospheric teleconnections that influence regional climate thousands of kilometers away from the point of forcing improving societally relevant projections of regional climate impacts will require a better understanding of the magnitudes of regional forcings and the associated climate responses
1382766 several types of forcings most notably aerosols land use and land cover change and modifications to biogeochemistry impact the climate system in nonradiative ways in particular by modifying the hydrological cycle and vegetation dynamics aerosols exert a forcing on the hydrological cycle by modifying cloud condensation nuclei ice nuclei precipitation efficiency and the ratio between solar direct and diffuse radiation received other nonradiative forcings modify the biological components of the climate system by changing the fluxes of trace gases and heat between vegetation soils and the atmosphere and by modifying the amount and types of vegetation nonradiative forcings have eventual radiative impacts so one option would be to quantify these radiative impacts however this approach may not convey appropriately the impacts of nonradiative forcings on societally relevant climate variables such as precipitation or ecosystem function any new metrics must also be able to characterize the regional structure in nonradiative forcing and climate response
1382767 temperature trends in the lower atmosphere steps for understanding and reconciling differences
1382768 the process for completing the ccsp report excluded valid scientific perspectives under the charge of the committee the editor of the report tom karl systematically excluded a range of views on the issue of understanding and reconciling lower atmospheric temperature trends the executive summary of the ccsp report ignores critical scientific issues and makes unbalanced conclusions concerning our current understanding of temperature trends
1382769 future assessment committees need to appoint members with a diversity of views and who do not have a significant conflict of interest with respect to their own work such committees should be chaired by individuals committed to the presentation of a diversity of perspectives and unwilling to engage in strong arm tactics to enforce a narrow perspective any such committee should be charged with summarizing all relevant literature even if inconvenient or which presents a view not held by certain members of the committee
1382770 i think we made it a little harder on ourselves by not moving the ball around as much
1382771 we didnt make our outside shots tonight as well as weve been in the past but at the end of the day we won the ballgame we found a way to win
1382772 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ballgame
1382773 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1382774 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1382775 we cant have those type of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball

1382830 you also think penicillin is the work of the devil right
1382831 it is well for a man not to touch a woman but because of the temptation to immorality each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband the husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights and likewise the wife to her husband for the wife does not rule over her own body but the husband does likewise the husband does not rule over his own body but the wife does do not refuse one another except perhaps by agreement for a season that you may devote yourselves to prayer but then come together again lest satan tempt you through lack of self control i say this by way of concession not of command wish that all were as i myself am but each has his own special gift from god one of one kind and one of another

1383149 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
1383150 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
1383151 religion is for allah then fight in the cause of allah and know that allah heareth and knoweth all things
1383152 fighting is prescribed for you and ye dislike it but it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you and that ye love a thing which is bad for you but allah knoweth and ye know not
1383153 as to those who reject faith i will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the hereafter nor will they have anyone to help
1383154 soon shall we cast terror into the hearts of the unbelievers for that they joined companions with allah for which he had sent no authority
1383155 let those fight in the way of allah who sell the life of this world for the other whoso fighteth in the way of allah be he slain or be he victorious on him we shall bestow a vast reward
1383156 they but wish that ye should reject faith as they do and thus be on the same footing as they but take not friends from their ranks until they flee in the way of allah from what is forbidden but if they turn renegades seize them and slay them wherever ye find them and in any case take no friends or helpers from their ranks
1383157 not equal are those believers who sit at home and receive no hurt and those who strive and fight in the cause of allah with their goods and their persons
1383158 the punishment of those who wage war against allah and his messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned this shall be as a disgrace for them in this world and in the hereafter they shall have a grievous chastisement
1383159 o ye who believe when ye meet those who disbelieve in battle turn not your backs to them 16 whoso on that day turneth his back to them unless maneuvering for battle or intent to join a company he truly hath incurred wrath from allah and his habitation will be hell a hapless journeys end
1383160 and fight with them until there is no more persecution and religion should be only for allah
1383161 if thou comest on them in the war deal with them so as to strike fear in those who are behind them that haply they may remember
1383162 and let not those who disbelieve suppose that they can outstrip allahs purpose lo they cannot escape make ready for them all thou canst of armed force and of horses tethered that thereby ye may dismay the enemy of allah and your enemy
1383163 so when the sacred months have passed away then slay the idolaters wherever you find them and take them captives and besiege them and lie in wait for them in every ambush then if they repent and keep up prayer and pay the poor rate leave their way free to them
1383164 fight them allah will punish them by your hands and bring them to disgrace
1383165 those who believe and have left their homes and striven with their wealth and their lives in allahs way are of much greater worth in allahs sight these are they who are triumphant
1383166 fight those who believe not in allah nor the last day nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by allah and his messenger nor acknowledge the religion of truth even if they are of the people of the book until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued
1383167 and the jews say ezra is the son of allah and the christians say the messiah is the son of allah these are the words of their mouths they imitate the saying of those who disbelieved before may allah destroy them how they are turned away
1383168 o ye who believe what is the matter with you that when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of allah ye cling heavily to the earth do ye prefer the life of this world to the hereafter but little is the comfort of this life as compared with the hereafter unless ye go forth he will punish you with a grievous penalty and put others in your place
1383169 go forth light armed and heavy armed and strive with your wealth and your lives in the way of allah that is best for you if ye but knew
1383170 o prophet strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them and their abode is hell and evil is the destination
1383171 but the messenger and those who believe with him strive and fight with their wealth and their persons for them are all good things and it is they who will prosper
1383172 allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods for theirs in return is the garden of paradise they fight in his cause and slay and are slain a promise binding on him in truth through the law the gospel and the quran and who is more faithful to his covenant than allah then rejoice in the bargain which ye have concluded that is the achievement supreme
1383173 o you who believe fight those of the unbelievers who are near to you and let them find in you hardness
1383174 we gave the good things of this life to these men and their fathers until the period grew long for them see they not that we gradually reduce the land in their control from its outlying borders is it then they who will win
1383175 therefore listen not to the unbelievers but strive against them with the utmost strenuousness with the quran
1383176 so when you meet in battle those who disbelieve then smite the necks until when you have overcome them then make them prisoners
1383177 be not weary and faint hearted crying for peace when ye should be uppermost for allah is with you
1383178 there is no blame for the blind nor is there blame for the lame nor is there blame for the sick that they go not forth to war and whoso obeyeth allah and his messenger he will make him enter gardens underneath which rivers flow and whoso turneth back him will he punish with a painful doom
1383179 muhammad is the messenger of allah and those with him are hard ruthless against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves
1383180 o ye who believe shall i lead you to a bargain that will save you from a grievous penalty that ye believe in allah and his messenger and that ye strive your utmost in the cause of allah with your property and your persons that will be best for you if ye but knew he will forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and to beautiful mansions in gardens of eternity
1383181 o prophet strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be stern with them hell will be their home a hapless journeys end
1383182 the hour will not be established until you fight with the jews and the stone behind which a jew will be hiding will say
1383183 o muslim there is a jew hiding behind me so kill him
1383184 they i e women and children are from them i e pagans
1383185 i have been ordered to fight the people till they say none has the right to be worshipped but allah
1383186 abu dharr reported i said messenger of allah which of the deeds is the best he the holy prophet replied belief in allah and jihad in his cause
1383187 he the messenger of allah did that and said there is another act which elevates the position of a man in paradise to a grade one hundred higher and the elevation between one grade and the other is equal to the height of the heaven from the earth he abu said said what is that act he replied jihad in the way of allah jihad in the way of allah
1383188 o allahs apostle this ordinary fire would have been sufficient to torture the unbelievers
1383189 the hell fire has 69 parts more than the ordinary worldly fire each part is as hot as this worldly fire
1383190 this was spoken on muhammads death bed and was one of the last things that he ever said
1383191 i am with you give firmness to the believers i will instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers smite ye above their necks and smite all their finger tips off them

1383323 diverse reclamebureaus zeggen dat de interesse van vele klanten voor online videoreclame en rich media vooral bij extravagante projecten met grote productiekosten de jongste tijd gevoelig is bekoeld
1383324 dat heeft volgens daniel stein chief executive van het reclamebureau evb wellicht te maken met de preceptie van marketeers over het online kanaal hij voert aan dat online budgetten goedkoper zijn en er in moeilijke periode meer druk is om die beperkt te houden televisie wordt bestempeld als een ge nstitutionaliseerd medium dat nog altijd grote budgetten kan rechtvaardigen

1383328 many large construction firms are taking this issue seriously but the same degree of diligence is not evidenced by procurers
1383329 for those involved in selection of these contracts in both the public and commercial sectors there has been a decided lack of action in dealing with this issue
1383330 in any recession key economic stimuli involve public works so in order to maintain the full range of policy tools adopting a position of waiting and seeing then advising accordingly is not appropriate
1383331 because our customers are seeing a downturn in the industry we cant pass our rising costs on so we end up stuck between a rock and a hard place
1383332 we believe electricity prices have risen by 70 in the past 12 months while on average electricity prices are 25 higher in the uk than in the rest of europe
1383333 this has a significant impact on the ability of uk companies to compete in international markets
1383334 the industry has been saying to the government that there is an anomaly in what manufacturers are paying in the uk and in europe
1383335 if the government wants to attract industry to the uk and ensure the uk competes on the world stage it needs to look at taking pressures off the industry

1383357 the problem is that people buy a fund after the manager has proven that they are a high performer but they sell the first time theres a problem
1383358 they wind up chasing performance buying high and selling low instead of sticking with a manager who has proven that they can deliver if you give them enough time

1383362 i dont know dad but i know i wouldnt want to be anywhere else in the world right now than right here
1383363 should someone ask me whether i would indicate the west such as it is today as a model to my country frankly i would have to answer negatively
1383364 the western world has lost its civil courage both as a whole and separately in each country and of course in the united nations such a decline is especially notable among ruling groups and the intellectual elite they get tongue tied and paralyzed when they deal with powerful governments and threatening forces with aggressors and international terrorists
1383365 every citizen has been granted the desired freedom and material goods in such quantity and of such quality as to guarantee in theory the pursuit of happiness so why and for what should one risk ones precious life in defense of common values and particularly in such nebulous cases when the security of ones nation must be defended in a distant country
1383366 people in the west has acquired considerable skill in using interpreting and manipulating law if one is right from a legal point of view nothing more is required nobody might mention that one could still not be entirely right and urge self restraint a willingness to show restraint or sacrifice everybody operates at the extreme limits of those legal frames a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either
1383367 legal frames especially in the united states are broad enough to encourage not only individual freedom but also certain individual crimes the culprit can go unpunished or obtain undeserved leniency with the support of legions of public defenders when a government starts an earnest fight against terrorism public opinion immediately accuses it of violating the terrorists civil rights there are many such cases
1383368 destructive and irresponsible freedom has been granted boundless space soceity appears to have litle defense against the abyss of human decadence such as misuse of liberty for moral violence against young people motion pictures full of pornography crime and horror such a tilt of freedom in the directionof evil has come about gradually but it was evidently born out of a humanistic concept according to which there is no evil inherent to human nature
1383369 the press too enjoys the widest freedom but what use does it make of this freedom the press has become the greatest power within the western countries more powerful than the legislature the executive and the judiciary one would then like to ask by what law has it been elected and to whom is it responsible how many hasty immature superficial and misleading judgments are expressed every day confusing readers and without any verification thus we see terrorists made into heroes or secret matters pertaining to the national defense publicly revealed or shameful intrusion into the privacy of people under the false slogan everyone has the right to know everything
1383370 mere freedom does not in the least solve all the problems of human life and it even adds some new ones we have placed too much hope in political and social reforms only to find out that we were being deprived of our most precious possession our spiritual life

1383372 diese stetige leichte steigerung der einsatzzahlen beobachten wir schon seit jahren gerade bei den hilfeleistungen bzw bei der rettung und bergung von tieren sind diese steigerungen zu verzeichnen

1383375 hinzu kamen 519 hilfeleistungen und 74 mal wurden wir gerufen ohne dass unser einsatz letztlich n tig war weil sich beispielsweise das vermeintliche feuer als qualm vom gerade gel schten grill herausstellte
1383376 wir sind nat rlich auch zust ndig wenn tote tiere gefunden werden zum beispiel als folge von verkehrsunf llen

1383394 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1383395 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1383396 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1383397 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1383398 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1383399 they really wanted to blame somebody in the middle east

1383411 my father sardar kartar singh sachdev was a patw ri before he became a building contractor he wished that i become a doctor but it was my mother amar kaur who was a big inspiration behind my music and my success as a classical musician she herself wanted to be a musician but being a girl she was not allowed to follow her dreams i remember her melodious voice coming from heart full of emotions while she was churning yogurt to make fresh butter and lassi in the early morning hours singing folk music of punjab she was sowing a seed of music in me full of deep human emotions and pains and joys of life as soon as she witnessed my passion and deep desire for music she went out of the way to help me emotionally and financially and did not allow anybody to come in my way interfere in my quest with my stubborn nature and her help and wahegurus kirpa i could fulfill my dreams i did my pre medical exams to join medicine but i was so taken in by music that i dropped the idea of becoming a doctor which was then a very prestigious profession in india and i have never felt sorry for renouncing it

1383442 most people who are in the know realize that nashville isnt all rhinestones and belt buckles
1383443 by using rock the block we can see new acts and figure out who we might be able to do a show with later or have open up for a national act
1383444 ive heard that nashville will never break a great rock band but i think thats bunk because there are some unbelievable rock acts here
1383445 scenes never live up to the country scene here and were always going to be dwarfed by it
1383446 but its our motivation to break a band out of nashville and i think there are three or four that have what it takes
1383447 nashville in the last 10 years has changed and the entertainment industry is catching up

1383454 no se va a corregir por las v as coercitivas ni de prohibiciones y mucho menos entrabando cada vez m s los tr mites de importaci n de maquinarias insumos implementos o de alimentos cuando sea necesario
1383455 planificar la agricultura a mediano plazo porque el abastecimiento se corregir en la medida en que podamos incrementar producci n a la par que incrementamos la productividad
1383456 es necesario ir disminuyendo la dependencia en leguminosas y oleaginosas y en esto debemos lograr trabajar coherentemente todos los actores de la cadena productiva junto con las pol ticas del ejecutivo nacional para una visi n de mediano plazo hicimos el planteamiento en la ltima asamblea de fedec maras en cuanto a que deber amos en 10 a os llegar al autoabastecimiento de aquellas leguminosas que podemos producir en el pa s como caraota y frijol
1383457 s lo se puede lograr en una mesa de negociaci n y trabajo entre el ejecutivo y el sector productivo del pa s
1383458 esto se tiene que hacer sentados en una mesa respetando los actores y entendiendo cu les son las limitantes para poder producir y entre ellas se pasea una rentabilidad pues la agricultura es una actividad econ mica el agricultor tiene que tener la ganancia y poder continuar sembrado
1383459 tenemos muchas expectativas para hablar por lo menos de un programa piloto en materia de caraota junto con los investigadores nacionales otros organismos y los agricultores organizados
1383460 son una herramienta que en el a o 2007 funcion a la perfecci n pero hay unos retrasos y unos rezagos y as se lo hicimos saber al ministro el as jaua ministerio de agricultura y tierras quien se comprometi a que en los pr ximos d as se estar a iniciando las cancelaciones de esto
1383461 para que tome cartas en el asunto porque definitivamente no sabemos si es en el milco ministerio de industrias ligeras y comercio o en cadivi comisi n de administraci n y divisas donde se est complicando la importaci n de la maquinaria
1383462 ya que han creado varios ministerios de los que depende la agricultura y que siguen complicando las cosas
1383463 el importar pollo no solamente limita y compite deslealmente sino que el pollo que se produce en el pa s es el que consume el ma z que producimos los venezolanos y es el que generar empleo en venezuela y permite el desarrollo en el campo
1383464 con car cter de urgencia de las pol ticas de precios del arroz en nuestro pa s porque con los controles por debajo de los costos de producci n nadie puede producir
1383465 con el alza de los precios internacionales de los productos venezuela tendr a que aprovechar esta oportunidad para abrazar su agricultura lo m s importante es que el venezolano pueda conseguir sus alimentos por los canales regulares de comercializaci n
1383466 pero con una producci n de ca a de az car superior a la capacidad de molienda de los centrales en el pa s se hace urgente la culminaci n de los centrales azucareros ezequiel zamora y el de cojedes
1383467 la medida no fue suficiente para poder compensar los costos de producci n tanto del sector industrial como del sector productor y por otro lado la ca a de az car no tiene incremento en el monto del subsidio para la zafra 2007 2008
1383468 porque si no aumentamos su precio al caficultor correremos con el riesgo de que no va a tener los recursos para poderlos invertir en su plantaci n
1383469 carne leche y queso hay suficiente y decir que no hay es una mentira
1383470 hay ganado en el pa s suficiente en este momento e inclusive los productores tienen que hacer cola de alrededor de 15 d as o m s para entregar el ganado en los mataderos
1383471 hay en cantidades y la producci n nacional en este momento est alrededor de los siete millones de litros de leche por d a con un mercado saturado de quesos
1383472 las cifras de fegaven reflejan alrededor de 3 millones y medio de litros de leche por d a que tenemos en nuestras plantas adem s en algunas queseras artesanales
1383473 en total son cerca de siete millones de litros los que hay en este momento en el pa s en producci n por d a pero existen eventuales fallas de colocaci n que responden a un factor temporal ya que en esta poca de cada a o disminuye el consumo de tales rubros hay que decir algo importante con relaci n a esto en el pa s cuando hay mayor volumen de producci n que son los meses de mayo junio julio agosto y septiembre cae el consumo porque todo el mundo est de vacaciones cae el consumo de queso jam n y leche por eso es preciso que se estudie la posibilidad de cambiar el calendario escolar y que las clases comiencen en febrero y sean continuas hasta noviembre para as aprovechar en las escuelas y en todo el pa s los meses de mayor producci n
1383474 trabajan en conjunto en beneficio del abastecimiento de estos rubros y a favor de la seguridad alimentaria
1383475 de esta manera se garantiza la producci n agr cola en el campo y el bienestar de muchas familias
1383476 este es el reflejo del esfuerzo mancomunado del gobierno y las empresas financieras en beneficio de las familias tachirenses y en apoyo al sector agr cola y pecuario
1383477 en el caso de la prevenci n se crea la junta liquidadora del sasa servicio aut nomo de sanidad y se crea un instituto de salud agr cola para darle mayor viabilidad y fortaleza a las competencias de esta nueva instancia en las regiones

1383491 we will continue with efforts aimed at reversing this level of maternal mortality
1383492 the fight to lower maternal and infant mortality will remain a preoccupation in the coming years
1383493 while maternal mortality fell from 890 deaths per 100 000 live births in 1990 the government feels this is still too high as are infant and childhood mortality rates
1383494 a figure of 220 neo natal deaths in one year is too high
1383495 a clear sign of how much our society has deteriorated in values and sense of responsibility
1383496 are now sponsoring educational institutions only in name sponsors must wake up to their responsibilities of moulding the school community into a unit where morals responsibility and obligations are the most important elements in the education of the child

1383505 favors were called in things were done i think i did all my vocals live in three days with the band two weeks after my newborn son came home from the hospital it was not an ideal time or way to make a record but its what i had the money to do when i had the time to do it
1383506 i think its a very cool way to get the fans more involved
1383507 theyre part of it and we wouldnt exist if they werent there it creates a bigger connection between us and the fans and thats more valuable than all the money were going to get for it
1383508 i think mark erelli is really one of the unsung pillars of excellence in songwriting and i think hes vastly under recognized and underappreciated in the music scene
1383509 it allows us to spend less money in the recording studio so more of that money can get spent elsewhere in the promotion and marketing of records
1383510 with sales shrinking we just have to be more conservative
1383511 but at the same time we definitely have more to spend on promotion than we would have if we had to pay for the record theres only so much money to go around so this is really a leg up for us
1383512 it certainly works the first time but you have to wonder two or three albums down the line if the fans will be willing to shell out
1383513 the new record is called starting over for a reason
1383514 i wanted the title to be direct simple and set the tone for the album in this past year i experienced the unraveling of my marriage and the birth of my first son

1383539 the foreign office was clearly disturbed that former ambassadors like christopher meyer and craig murray were able to publish highly critical memoirs while paying only lip service to the rules
1383540 but in trying to stop that happening again they have changed the rules in a way that has at least on paper serious unintended consequences this looks like a case of back to the drawing board
1383541 in practice the foreign office continues to rely on the good sense of its former staff
1383542 the key stage two sats have become little more than vanity testing proof for the government of rising standards in primary schools which the consumers of these results secondary schools arent buying
1383543 many teachers are now finding that pupils are not at the levels they appear to be at in their tests there is such pressure to do whatever to get kids to the highest levels and for many that means coaching
1383544 these may well represent only the tip of the iceberg in terms of national concerns about the reliability and validity of this years results
1383545 the shambles surrounding the marking of this years tests are a disgrace 460 schools still do not have results for all of their pupils
1383546 the government must now waive the remarking costs to schools for this years exams it would be totally wrong for schools to pay the price for the governments and ets incompetence
1383547 yet again ministers have failed to meet their own targets too many children will be starting secondary school without having a good grasp of the core subjects
1383548 we would like to see a complete review of the current industrial testing system
1383549 we need to move education away from teaching to tests
1383550 the money saved would be better used to finance the governments personalization and intervention agendas
1383551 many people are questioning the value of ks3 testing and there is increasing evidence that the results of ks2 testing are not providing the information which secondary schools want or trust
1383552 a director of education from one of the welsh local authorities has told me of what he saw as a transformation for the better in year 6 following the demise of ks2 testing
1383553 criticising the publishing of the sats results shows a lack of understanding of statistical theory with almost complete returns the results are reliable at a national level
1383554 this doesnt say much however as the reliability of the test results has always been too low to provide accurate comparisons between schools
1383555 atl therefore continues to campaign for the replacement of tests by teacher assessment which can provide a better picture of a young persons learning while reducing the relentless pressure of testing on students
1383556 the proportion of 11 year olds reaching the governments target level 4 has increased more or less steadily since national tests were introduced in 1994 but the rise has not been rapid
1383557 there is also substantial disagreement about what even this slow rate of progress means
1383558 in fact more care has been taken to maintain the standards of the national curriculum tests often incorrectly called sats than gcse or a level
1383559 of course this would be ok if our tests measured what was important in the modern world but they dont
1383560 national assessment is not a bad idea nor is holding schools accountable for how much their students learn but current government policy is driving schools in the wrong direction and needs to be changed nothing less than our future
1383561 once again the results show steady and sustained progress overall reflecting the hard work of teachers and pupils
1383562 their success should be celebrated and they should be given the opportunity to enjoy it
1383563 this year as every year the results are based on a statistically robust sample any claims that not all the results are available and therefore they should not be published should be dismissed as ill informed nonsense
1383564 i have no doubt however that the serial detractors who rush every year to criticise the outcome of the tests will once again be much in evidence
1383565 arguably risks undermining the rights of fair trial for the individuals concerned
1383566 we are concerned that some of the proposals being put forward by the government in the counter terrorism bill would place inappropriate responsibilities on parliament
1383567 considering that any debate will be highly political in nature and any vote may well be whipped by the political parties we are deeply concerned that the independence of the judiciary may appear to be undermined and that trials may be prejudiced
1383568 the committee joins a long list of experts who have condemned the governments ill thought through proposals for 42 days as both unfair and unworkable
1383569 it doesnt have shareholders now that its owned by the government so its got to come to us so what weve said is that we will put in up to 3bn
1383570 weve got to get state aid approval for that so we cant give a precise figure but up to 3bn may be necessary
1383571 i think the prime minister is very focused on what we need to do to recapture peoples enthusiasm
1383572 but i am very clear in my mind that provided we can get across to people what were for the difference that the government can make the clear principles of fairness that govern everything we can do then we can turn this situation around

1383577 pulitzer prize winning journalist ron suskind claims that after the iraq war began the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein in an attempt to tie hussein to the 9 11 attacks
1383578 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq and that iraq bought yellowcake uranium from niger with the help of al qaeda
1383579 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1383580 now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1383581 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1383582 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1383583 unfortunately i dont recall i cant remember the specifics regarding that question i cant recall being made personally aware of that knowledge ive spent a lot of time reading about quantum mechanics lately and its hard for me to distinguish what occured in our slice of space time from what i might have theorised to have occured in a parallel universe
1383584 well we did find the original letter but it was lost in transit a fire an explosion we merely asked cia to copy the original that was lost

1383596 differentiating instruction means shaking up what goes in the classroom so that the students have multiple options for taking in information making sense of ideas and expressing what they learn
1383597 differentiated instruction is doing what is fair for students it is a collection of best practices as strategically employed to maximize students learning at every turn including giving them the tools to handle anything that is undifferentiated
1383598 lesson should be learner centered because learning is the active construction of knowledge by the learner so teachers base lessons on students need and interests
1383599 we liked the idea of having playful elements along with timeless and ageless pieces the symbols are attachable and you can take the jewelry and make it your own there are solid silver and gold pieces to wear forever and comfort pieces that youll put on and wear everywhere
1383600 some of my kids dont like reading but love staring at a computer so i might start teaching literature on e books to give students the alternative of reading online
1383601 must educate themselves on how to best use those tools to enhance teaching and learning
1383602 today the taboo against using the l1 in the classroom is breaking down as it recognized that some learners use the l1 as a communication strategy to successfully learn and use the l2 james 1998 odlin 1989
1383603 because so many learners successfully use the l1 to circumvent communication breakdowns we would do well to remember that the first language can be a facilitating factor and not just an interfering factor

1383664 the berlin police president count wolf heinrich von helldorf announced that as a result of a police activity in the last few weeks the entire jewish population of berlin had been disarmed with the confiscation of 2 569 hand weapons 1 702 firearms and 20 000 rounds of ammunition
1383665 one of the first legal measures issued was an order by heinrich himmler commander of all german police forbidding jews to possess any weapons whatever and imposing a penalty of twenty years confinement in a concentration camp upon every jew found in possession of a weapon hereafter
1383666 men in whose homes old rusty revolvers had been found during the last few days cried aloud that they did not dare ever again return to their places of residence or business
1383667 should you be so trusting and turn over your weapons you will be put on a black list in spite of everything
1383668 military orders now forbid the french to do things which the german people have not been allowed to do since hitler came to power to own radio senders or to listen to foreign broadcasts to organize public meetings and distribute pamphlets to disseminate anti german news in any form
1383669 before the advent of hitler or stalin who took power from the german and russian people measures were thrust upon the free legislatures of those countries to deprive the people of the possession and use of firearms so that they could not resist the encroachments of such diabolical and vitriolic state police organizations as the gestapo the ogpu and the cheka
1383670 the people have a right to keep arms therefore if we should have some executive who attempted to set himself up as dictator or king the people can organize themselves together and with the arms and ammunition they have they can properly protect themselves
1383671 1 to authorize the requisitioning or require the registration of any firearms possessed by any individual for his personal protection or sport and the possession of which is not prohibited or the registration of which is not required by existing law or
1383672 2 to impair or infringe in any manner the right of any individual to keep and bear arms
1383673 for being found without a jewish badge and for refusing to move into the ghetto

1383675 from berlin on january 6th the german official radio broadcast the german military commander for belgium and northern france announced yesterday that the population would be given a last opportunity to surrender firearms without penalty up to january 20th and after that date anyone found in possession of arms would be executed
1383676 so the nazi invaders set a deadline similar to that announced months ago in czechoslovakia in poland in norway in romania in yugoslavia in greece
1383677 how often have we read the familiar dispatches gestapo agents accompanied by nazi troopers swooped down on shops and homes and confiscated all privately owned firearms
1383678 what an aid and comfort to the invaders and to their fifth column cohorts have been the convenient registration lists of privately owned firearms lists readily available for the copying or stealing at the town hall in most european cities
1383679 what a constant worry and danger to the hun and his quislings have been the privately owned firearms in the homes of those few citizens who have neglected to register their guns

1383681 it certainly has not been abused it may be underutilized
1383682 the bottom line from our perspective is it may very well have saved lives
1383683 in every case i was involved in i thought it was an abuse
1383684 the overriding concern is anybody can report anybody with or without substantiation and i dont think that is the american way
1383685 continues to invest unusual and far reaching powers in police authority that does not belong there
1383686 police to act as psychologists in trying to predict and interpret behavior

1383701 we need a holistic gospel and a holistic mission because the world is a holistic mess
1383702 the fact is that sin and evil constitute bad news in every area of life on this planet the saving work of god through the cross of christ is good news for every area of life touched by sin which means every area of life bluntly we need a holistic gospel and a holistic mission because the world is a holistic mess
1383703 at ekibastuz any writing would be seized as contraband so he devised a method that enabled him to retain even long sections of prose after seeing lithuanian catholic prisoners fashion rosaries out of beads made from chewed bread he asked them to make a similar chain for him but with more beads in his hands each bead came to represent a passage that he would repeat to himself until he could say it without hesitation only then would he move on to the next bead he later wrote that by the end of his prison term he had committed to memory 12 000 lines in this way
1383704 the greatest and most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever to be leveled in modern times
1383705 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
1383706 in the midst of exhausting prison camp relocations marching in a column of prisoners in the gloom of bitterly cold evenings with strings of camp lights glimmering through the darkness we would often feel rising in our breast what we would have wanted to shout out to the whole world if only the whole world could have heard us
1383707 it is within the power of writers and artists to do much more to defeat the lie
1383708 in terms of the effect he has had on history solzhenitsyn is the dominant writer of the 20th century who else compares orwell koestler and yet when his name comes up now it is more often than not as a freak a monarchist an anti semite a crank a has been
1383709 solzhenitsyn is a notable writer but his political views are an embarrassment even to his fellow dissidents
1383710 not only would a meeting with the president offend the soviets but it would raise some controversy about solzhenitsyns views of the united states and its allies
1383711 we were laughing and agreeing about how we thought solzhenitsyns views on the united states his criticism of the press and all the rest were deeply wrong and on and on
1383712 and then joseph said but you know susan everything solzhenitsyn says about the soviet union is true
1383713 shukov felt pleased with his life as he went to sleep
1383714 the end of an unclouded day almost a happy one

1383718 it is impossible to go on writing as one did before
1383719 a man with a unique life story whose name will endure throughout the history of russia
1383720 severe trials befell solzhenitsyn as they did millions of other people in this country
1383721 he was among the first to speak out about the brutality of stalins regime and about the people who experienced it but were not crushed
1383722 changed the minds of millions of people making them rethink their past and present
1383723 probably i would not have survived eight years of the camps if as a mathematician i had not been assigned for three years to a sharashka
1383724 i was like the sick people all around me and yet i was different
1383725 i had fewer rights than they had and was forced to be more silent people came to visit them and their one concern their one aim in life was to get well again but if i recovered it would be almost pointless i was 35 years of age and yet in that spring i had no one i could call my own in the whole world i did not even own a passport and if i were to recover i should have to leave this green abundant land and go back to my desert where i had been exiled in perpetuity there i was under open surveillance reported on every fortnight and for a long time the local police had not even allowed me a dying man to go away for treatment
1383726 demand and ensure the abolition of all censorship open or hidden
1383727 no one can bar the road to truth and to advance its cause i am prepared to accept even death
1383728 courageous creative work upholding the sense of human dignity and exposing the trampling of the human soul and the destruction of human values
1383729 she simply joined me in my struggle and we went side by side
1383730 in a strange way i not only hope i am inwardly convinced that i shall go back
1383731 i live with that conviction i mean my physical return not just my books and that contradicts all rationality
1383732 he wrote ate and slept and that was about all
1383733 for him to accept a telephone call was an event he rarely left his 50 acres
1383734 instead of secluding myself here and writing the red wheel i suppose i could have spent time making myself likable to the west
1383735 the only problem is that i would have had to drop my way of life and my work
1383736 his own convictions are deeply rooted in the russian spirit which is untempered by the civilizing influences of a democratic tradition
1383737 like the russian masses he we may assume has strong authoritarian tendencies
1383738 leading intellectuals here consider his oratory hollow his time past and his mission unclear
1383739 in fact is not anti semitic his books are not anti semitic and he is not in his personal relations anti jewish natalias mother is jewish and not a few of his friends are too

1383760 it is to a certain point a combination of what i knew then as a child and what i know now as an adult
1383761 in sudbury where i grew up there wasnt much cultural diversity but then i came to toronto and met many nice people from many different cultures
1383762 i think a lot of why i moved had to do with the whole leaving the nest thing
1383763 there wasnt a lot of work or opportunity at that time
1383764 car repairs and dealing with people have always been kind of an interest of mine
1383765 plus every day youre learning something new in that industry
1383766 we had this idea about six years ago and then never really thought about it again
1383767 then one day she called me and said what do you think about this for a first chapter we just kind of went at it from there
1383768 there were no creative differences surprisingly because i was worried about that too it really was a family affair
1383769 my sister actually heard about the acceptance first and then it was like wow this is really going to happen
1383770 one of my neighbours is a metro toronto police officer and one day i offered to cut her grass i cut it in the shape of the canadiens logo
1383771 we always sort of thought that this character could be in a series of books

1383777 the ships logs have also shed light on extreme weather events such as hurricanes it is commonly believed that hurricanes form in the eastern atlantic and track westwards so scientists were shocked in 2005 when hurricane vince instead moved northeast to hit southern spain and portugal many interpreted this as a consequence of climate change but wheeler along with colleagues at the university of madrid used old ships logs to show that this had also happened in 1842 when a hurricane followed the same trajectory into andalusia
1383778 wahai orang orang yang beriman diwajibkan kepada kamu puasa sebagaimana telah diwajibkan atas orang orang yang sebelum kamu supaya kamu menjadi orang orang yang bertaqwa
1383779 bukanlah puasa itu hanya sekedar menghentikan makan dan minum tetapi puasa itu ialah menghentikan omong omong kosong dan kata kata kotor
1383780 makan dan minumlah kamu dan janganlah berlebih lebihan sesungguhnya allah tidak menyukai orang orang yang berlebih lebihan
1383781 kita ini adalah kaum yang makan bila lapar dan makan tidak kenyang
1383782 tenk p hva som hadde skjedd om det hadde lykkes
1383783 im so glad youre awake i didnt think you would ever wake up
1383784 prince isaac the valley sweets you should have just left me behind
1383785 mostly it was so bad it took all my healing knowledge to pull it off and double my normal efforts due to your unworldly resistance to all things magic until today ive been too exhausted to move
1383786 thank you sweets but honestly you should have let robyne kill me it was as much as i deserved
1383787 whatever you did you did in the distant past the ravene i know is the sweetest most charming kind hearted being ive ever met thats someone worth saving
1383788 she knew we would head here and arrived to cut us off
1383789 she kept rage prisoner and forced him to move his visions on us but he managed to break free when robyne rove whoever became so concentrated on you
1383790 they never called us ravene and robyne when we were kids
1383791 we still have some time before we need to get to the valley thats what rage says
1383792 you may as well its the only way hell be able to hear you
1383793 rav this is rage sweetseve has given me possession of her body for a moment so that i may speak directly to you
1383794 i must inform you on the one called isaac as sweetseve just said you have some time before he is able to open the ethereal paths of the valley and enter the soulcenter he must wait two more days for the lunar eclipse only then with the power of the greatest shadow of all will he be able to get what he seeks
1383795 i am able to leave here on occasion though my curse inevitably pulls me back years ago i wanted desperately to get away i traveled to the ends of the earth and there i met a spirit a tormented being of light surrounded by shadow this spirit originally inhabited the soulcenter of the valley until it was driven away by king isaiah however in doing so isaiah was forced to leave a bit of his power marked upon this gentle being i took pity and told all of what i was years later isaiah was killed though his body died his power was so great that it lived on though badly damaged in order to keep living it needed a vessel so it sought out the bit of power it had once discarded that shadow was dark enough to blot out the light and when the spirit was reborn into human form it became the one we know as isaac
1383796 isaiah never took possession of the soulcenter but if isaac succeeds his power will be too great and terrible to even contemplate he may even be able to take the power away from the gods
1383797 she is an unknown factor this river has holy properties and once ran past the valley and out to the west but in our haste to save you we diverted its flow and it has washed her right into the diamond lake
1383798 if i have a blade that can destroy an angel if thats what she is now
1383799 i dont know if i can kill her or not but she cant be allowed to continue this existence an angel bent on revenge its destroying the memory of the kind pure soul ive cherished all these years i dont want to do it but i may have to
1383800 this is what you threw at robyne i cant believe you kept it
1383801 you gave it to me eight years ago so i could protect myself
1383802 im not sure why i guess i liked thinking that a piece of me was still with you and hoped that it meant something to you too
1383803 a piece of you was always with me but not the knife and i did cherish that more than anything especially during my darkest times
1383804 i get the feeling some more dark times are on the way before we see light again
1383805 yes but youre here now so it will be fine
1383806 it depends on whether i have the guts to destroy my own sister
1383807 into the wild or even across the sky if i cant destroy her well shell surely kill me and that makes the choice real easy
1383808 its hard to say but it always seems to rest on the shoulders of the most unlikely heroes will you be around to help
1383809 but we merely came to retrieve princess crystal and do not intend to join you in your coming battle
1383810 the stench of human would overpower our warriors so much we wouldnt be able to fight
1383811 belay that talk ellano the kind of bigotry the previous generations has inflicted upon our society is exactly why we were easy prey for raiders and slavers for so many centuries if you are going to insult my guests you may leave right now
1383812 i know most of our people are hesitant to trust anthromorphs but i have known several for my entire life and am even related to one a more honorable and noble friend you wont find even among our own kind with or without you i intend to see this through
1383813 your highness these anthromorphs have never had a formal army before
1383814 prince isaac mowed through our army like blades of grass and this was a force comprised of seasoned veterans and a long standard of military tradition
1383815 we now know that is not the case whatever hes looking for in the valley it will give him an immense power he must be stopped before he acquires that power and the only thing that stands in our way is his army if crystal ivory and i can get through to assist ravene and sweetseve we could end this war in one battle but as you said my anthromorphs are not experienced soldiers we would certainly welcome assistance from a force that knows isaacs tactics and has engaged him before
1383816 your majesty as a representative of my people i demand my right to veto i say we put this to a vote
1383817 not everyone shares your archaic views personally if were going to fight this isaac i would like all the help i could get
1383818 queen elyandrei disappeared years ago and though full authority does not fall to princess crystal until her sixteenth birthday i suppose i had better accept her decisions now if i want to have a job come next summer
1383819 if we fraternize with these humans what about after the war do we let them in amongst us free to raid and slaughter like they have been wont to do for years
1383820 remember when i first came back home and we went after those slavers some of them were anthromorphs as well as i recall in fact the thing that separates us from being animals is the very fact that there is human in all of us
1383821 youve been idealizing a half breed this entire time do you throw me out execute me or displace me or do you trust my judgment as you always have because im still peric my skin is the only thing changed
1383822 there wont be many more of these if isaac is left unchecked
1383823 well just have to put him in the ground with his old man then
1383824 crystal i truly am thankful for your help even if we do disagree on many nuances of life
1383825 i dont know its just you were very dashing in there i cant believe i havent seen your human form before now
1383826 among my people it would be a telltale sign of my heritage
1383827 ravene may flaunt his human side but ive always kept mine hidden
1383828 i expect many of my more conservative people will desert me come morning
1383829 even now messengers are on their way to our main force with a call of arms and they will link up with us shortly besides tradition and beliefs arent like one of your forms you cant change them instantly it takes time
1383830 if were victorious will you be around to help along that change
1383831 they destroyed evidence and failed to preserve the scene of the crime
1383832 ali tidak pernah menyembah berhala sama sekali karena dia memang masih kecil
1383833 berdirilah hai hamzah majulah hai ali majulah hai ubaidah bin harits
1383834 inilah dua golongan golongan mukmin dan golongan kafir yang bertengkar mereka saling bertengkar mengenai tuhan mereka
1383835 hamzah ali ubaidah ibnul harits utbah bin rabiah dan syaibah bin rabiah serta al walid bin utbah
1383836 saya sungguh sungguh akan berikan bendera perang esok hari kepada orang yang dengannya khaibar akan dibuka dan dia mencintai allah dan rasul nya sebagaimana allah dan rasul nya mencintainya
1383837 engkau tempatkan aku bersama para wanita dan anak anak di madinah

1383839 siapa yang membantahmu tentang kisah isa sesudah datang ilmu yang meyakinkan kamu maka katakanlah kepadanya
1383840 demi dzat yang membelah biji bijian dan menciptakan makhluk yang bernyawa sesungguhnya rasulullah yang ummi muhammad saw mengatakan kepada saya bahwa tidak ada yang mencintaiku kecuali seorang mukmin dan tidak ada yang membenciku kecuali seorang munafik
1383841 barangsiapa mencintai ali maka dia berarti mencintai saya dan siapa yang mencintai saya berarti dia mencintai allah barangsiapa membenci ali berarti dia membenci saya dan barangsiapa yang membenci saya berarti dia membenci allah
1383842 janganlah kalian mengeluhkan tentang ali sesungguhnya dia adalah orang yang paling takut kepada allah dan paling berani dalam jihad di jalan allah
1383843 wahai ali sesungguhnya dalam dirimu ada sesuatu yang menyerupai isa dia dibenci orang yahudi hingga mereka melecehkan ibunya dan dicintai oleh orang orang nashrani hingga mereka mendudukkannya pada posisi yang tidak benar ketahuilah sesungguhnya ada dua golongan yang akan hancur karena perlakuan mereka terhadapmu golongan yang berlebih lebihan dalam mencintaimu hingga mereka mendudukannmu pada posisi yang tidak benar dan golongan yang membencimu dengan keterlaluan hingga mereka melecehkanmu
1383844 wahai rasulullah engkau utus diriku kepaa suatu kaum yang lebih tua dariku supaya aku putuskan perkara di antara mereka
1383845 pergilah karena allah taala akan meneguhkan lisanmu dan memberi petunjuk kepada hatimu
1383846 janganlah kalian mengharapkan saya karena saya lebih senang menjadi wazir pembantu bagi kalian daripada menjadi amir
1383847 tidak demi allah kami tidak mengetahui ada orang yang lebih berhak menjadi khalifah daripada engkau
1383848 jika kalian tak menerima pendapatku dan tetap ingin membaiatku maka baiat tersebut hendaknya tidak bersifat rahasia tetapi aku akan pergi ke masjid maka siapa yang bermaksud membaiatku maka berbaiatlah kepadaku
1383849 kekhilafahan berlangsung selama 30 tahun dan setelah itu adalah kerajaan
1383850 mari kita hitung khilafah abu bakar ra berlangsung 2 tahun khilafah umar ra 10 tahun khilafah utsman ra 12 tahun dan khilafah ali ra 6 tahun

1383857 akibat maksiat adalah lemah dalam ibadah sempit dalam riizki berkurang lezatnya kehidupan

1383859 dua hal yang paling kutakuti atas kalian adalah panjang angan angan dan mengikuti hawa nafsu angan angan yang panjang dapat melalaikan akhirat sedang mengikuti hawa nafsu dapat menghalangi seseorang dari kebenaran ingatlah sesungguhnya dunia ini akan ditinggalkan dan akan datang penggantinya masing masing diantara dunia dan akhirat memiliki anak jadilah kalian anak anak akhirat dan jangan menjadi anak anak dunia karena hari ini dunia ada amal dan tidak ada hisab sedangkan hari esok akhirat ada hisab dan tidak ada lagi amal

1383863 send a message that the company should do a better job of treating patients
1383864 its another example of poor planning and its another example of reckless fiscal behavior by the district
1383865 it is important for the district to take action at this time
1383866 if we do not have great teachers with great training and great support how are we going to have successful schools
1383867 the children in oakland are all our children and i take responsibility for all our children
1383868 we just werent sure what the state rules would be were thrilled to be able to advance construction within the district to improve our schools
1383869 even though our student population is leveling off the need for new and improved schools remains great because of the age of our facilities
1383870 my feeling is the responsibility of this position does not change from dr fischer to dr thomas
1383871 washington one of the biggest mysteries surrounding the anthrax scare of 2001 why the anthrax laced letters were dropped off at a mailbox in new jersey may be connected to a sorority chapter at princeton university

1383879 until menifee starts growing again we will see enrollment at paloma remain somewhat flat
1383880 and weve been told we have some pretty large numbers of vacant houses were hoping a lot of these houses are becoming rentals at least
1383881 it can depend on property location there are a lot of variables
1383882 its not just the size of the property its the relationship to roads and utilities and the amount of infrastructure in place
1383883 its very difficult to build schools or pass a bond these days but we cant just sit around and wait until we burst at the seams were more serious than we ever have been before and our board is committed to this so im optimistic that we will be able to secure a site and begin the long and arduous process of building
1383884 the fact a home has a lower rating will likely put them on the path to improvement

1383907 the current policy well i wouldnt say policy of the american church but some of the practices of dioceses or certain dioceses in the american church continues to put our relations as a communion under strain and some problems wont be resolved while those practices continue
1383908 i might just add perhaps a note here one complication in discussing all this is that assumption readily made that the blessing of a same sex union and or the ordination of someone in an active same sex relationship is simply a matter of human rights thats an assumption i cant accept because i think the issues about what conditions the church lays down for the blessing of unions has to be shaped by its own thinking its own praying

1383998 the external environment has deteriorated and the consequences of this for northern rock are increased credit losses
1383999 following a review in july of the companys ongoing regulatory capital requirements hm treasury has committed to a significant strengthening of the companys capital base
1384000 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership
1384001 the governments decision to inject extra capital into northern rock means that uk taxpayers will become shareholders in a troubled mortgage lender during what looks set to be the severest downturn in the housing market for decades
1384002 the government might ultimately need to inject much more capital into northern rock putting further pressure on the public finances and further increasing the exposure of uk taxpayers
1384003 we had a positive meeting on monday there is another set up to sort out the details and we expect it to be resolved before the end of play on tuesday
1384004 we have had a request for a 40 percent increase in fees from our referees
1384005 they put forward three comparators they wanted us to base our decision on and there was no written support for that
1384006 they recognised that there is a need for a detailed review and study and yesterday we proposed how that might be done and today we are meeting to chart the way forward
1384007 things i think are moving in absolutely the right direction
1384008 i should say that since the spl started our referees have had an increase in the fee of 140 percent and our income has not increased anywhere like that level
1384009 but i think we are at the position with our referee colleagues that we have to get back to business as usual
1384010 noting who around you is quick to criticize and who is quick to encourage is a fast way to separate low achievers from high performance people

1384018 he could only bring two or three of his senate staff member no campaign officials or workers
1384019 obama could not bring any media only military photographers would be permitted to record obamas visit
1384020 he obama was more than welcome we were all ready for him
1384021 and spoke not a single word of opposition to our adventures in kosovo that anyone can recall
1384022 spiegel online has learned that obama has cancelled a planned short visit to the rammstein and landstuhl us military bases in the southwest german state of rhineland palatinate
1384023 during his trip as part of the codel to afghanistan and iraq senator obama visited the combat support hospital in the green zone in baghdad and had a number of other visits with the troops
1384024 for the second part of his trip the senator wanted to visit the men and women at landstuhl regional medical center to express his gratitude for their service and sacrifice the senator decided out of respect for these servicemen and women that it would be inappropriate to make a stop to visit troops at a u s military facility as part of a trip funded by the campaign
1384025 obama calls on europeans and americans to fight terror together
1384026 he could only bring two or three of his senate staff member no campaign officials or workers

1384031 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism
1384032 obama hasnt done anything as a legislator now it appears he did nothing as a student barack obama the nothing candidate
1384033 during his trip as part of the codel congressional delegation trip to afghanistan and iraq senator obama visited the combat support hospital in the green zone in baghdad and had a number of other visits with troops for the second part of his trip the senator wanted to visit the men and women at landstuhl regional medical center to express his gratitude for their service and sacrifice the senator decided out of respect for these servicemen and women that it would be inappropriate to make a stop to visit troops at a u s military facility as part of a trip funded by the campaign
1384034 senator obama had hoped to and every intention of visiting our troops to express his appreciation and gratitude for their service to our country we learned from the pentagon last night that the visit would be viewed instead as a campaign event senator obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event when his visit was to show his appreciation for our troops and decided instead not to go
1384035 as a sitting senator he obviously has an official interest in the well being of our service members and how the wounded and ill are being treated and certainly is welcome to visit a military medical center any time that he wants as you all know we do have certain policy guidelines for political campaigns and elections and what is appropriate and what is not appropriate int those situations but the pentagon certainly did not tell the senator that he could not visit landstuhl
1384036 the issue here is that if you are both a sitting senator and a political candidate when you are doing things like a visit to landstuhl you need to do it in your capacity as a sitting senator or you have to do it with restrictions that apply to any other candidate out there that might be running for office that is not a sitting senator
1384037 the military tries very had not to get involved in political campaigns
1384038 it wasnt here my understanding is either eucom european command or landstuhl themselves we learned a few days ago that there was some interest in sen obama going to landstuhl and all we did was simply remind people that sen obama is a sitting senator and his visit would need to be done consistent with a sitting senator
1384039 we told him he could visit landstuhl regional medical center in western germany with his senate staff but not with his campaign staff
1384040 he also stated he had visited the same troops 3 weeks ago and no one knew about it not even the media
1384041 the french support was of a political military diplomatic and logistic nature

1384045 one of our objectives is to get people to try it there are fruit beers wheat beers porters stouts milds and golden ales its incredibly diverse so theres something to meet everyones tastes
1384046 pasteurising and filtering a beer kills off a lot of the natural flavours
1384047 a processed keg beer is completely inert a dead flat liquid drawn up to bar with carbon dioxide to put some life in it thats why theyre so fizzy compared to a real ale

1384062 i dont want to deny that the last races didnt go as i wanted
1384063 every time something strange happened and we didnt manage to find the best possible set up for the car we tried to find a good compromise but it didnt help weve got to solve that problem now for the upcoming race at valencia
1384064 the qualifying was the decisive moment also at budapest in a negative way in my second try in q3 i couldnt keep the car on the track that was my fault
1384065 you cant pretend to win the title if youre always starting from the sixth position you can even drive one second faster per lap than the one ahead of you but if you start from behind you cant use the pace youve got
1384066 at the hungaroring i was stuck behind alonso who had a really good car for the last sector which was maybe the only point i could have tried to overtake again i had confirmed that its impossible to overtake at budapest

1384070 honestly racing in the rain you miss the whole race because you see absolutely nothing
1384071 the priority in this sport has to be our drivers and you had a number of drivers on the radio saying they cant see and are hydroplaning under caution
1384072 i dont think as a series we did a good job of listening to those so we fell victim joey couldnt see when guys stopped in front of him he ran into the back of them he had no warnings that the guy was going to stop
1384073 i have to be honest i had a lot of fun today this is pretty cool its the first points race in the rain but when drivers are saying enough is enough we need to heed that caution and we did not today
1384074 i just dont understand why we go past halfway in the rain
1384075 i think if youre halfway youve got to stop it and we went until there were 26 laps to go its pouring rain and were racing
1384076 its probably not something we should do unless we come up with a better system to be able to see
1384077 the tires worked fine all that stuff worked ok i dont have a problem with that just the lack of being able to see is the big issue and thats pretty dangerous if we come up with a better scenario theres no reason why we couldnt do it in the future but not with what we have now
1384078 we just have to come up with some better ventilation and stuff for the windows
1384079 as long as you keep the windows clean the cars are great in the rain theyre fun to race
1384080 they were a little bit hard but they worked really well
1384081 once we stopped and made a chassis change we had good traction and could come off the corner decent i have absolutely no complaint about the tires
1384082 if youre going to have a rain race do you create a possibility for options on what rain tires you use that rain tire is pretty durable but not necessarily ideal for the super heavy wet but ideal to manage the conditions we had today up until the downpour
1384083 if were going to do this in the future it provides goodyear with an opportunity to get a little more creative and have a couple different options for rain tires
1384084 i thought for sure we were going to have electrical problems with all the water that was coming in the car
1384085 for the first time for these guys to have a race in the rain we actually got a race in
1384086 that was a good thing it was treacherous it was tricky but i think all the drivers kept of the race track for the most part and we got a race in which is important i think to nascars credit for not running rain races very often that they did a pretty good job add comment
1384087 the s l e lupus foundation and all our members are extremely excited to be partnering with a young and talented driver like brad coleman in this race at watkins glen
1384088 we are even more excited about the opportunity to raise the awareness of lupus one of americas least recognized diseases we see this as our chance to inform millions of caring nascar fans that over 1 5 million americans have this mysterious and often devastating autoimmune disease and it is up to all of us to help find a cure
1384089 honestly i think its difficult because although there are going to be completely new rules next year there could be changes but ive never seen a car thats fighting at the back one year then sweep the field the next
1384090 its always step by step so its hard to close the gap whether its the aerodynamics the engine or the tyres whatever our problems are wed have to work very hard to close that gap
1384091 but to be honest its going to be difficult to move ahead of them top teams and to make a car that will be superior to theirs
1384092 they have said a lot of good positive things and i appreciate it
1384093 but im still focused on this year we are not going to throw in the towel we are going to fight until the last lap

1384100 the many new distribution paths are causing an increase in the demand for music use rights
1384101 in view of this fact we believe that building a business for the management and exploitation of such rights in europe is an attractive proposition
1384102 stop let me out i dont want to do this anymore
1384103 i have come to understand that money from the pharmaceutical industry can shape the practices of nonprofit organizations that purport to be independent in their viewpoints and actions
1384104 i think we may be coming to a point where hospitals and medical schools have to get serious about sanctioning
1384105 you can suspend doctors privileges or suspend their right to treat patients both have a huge impact on income and career but if youre serious about these disclosure policies you have to be willing to back them up
1384106 some patient groups are perilously close to becoming extensions of pharmaceutical companies marketing departments rather than grassroots the word rennie uses to describe such organisations is astroturf originating in the black arts of politics and public relations astroturfing is the practice of disguising an orchestrated campaign as a spontaneous upwelling of public opinion

1384116 i exist on pain medications after sixteen surgeries well i must have had stupid written on my forehead i would get a little relief each time i had surgery so i always thought surgery was the answer pain makes you reach out for some type of help youre willing to try and try again of course i had learned that each surgery causes more adhesions but i didnt know that one day the doctors would refuse to help me they
1384117 they never told me that they took out everything they could now im not sure if that made me better or worse at the time i thought it was the right move you think if they take things out it would have to help i dont know i still cant keep food down and i had that problem in the beginning
1384118 i had a hysterectomy the type where they go in through the belly you know the big cut then when i began getting sick the doctor said i had developed ibs irritable bowel syndrome it took a long time for me to learn that my problems were actually the result of that surgical procedure and how stupid can i be i opted for more surgeries

1384282 virtual monopoly due to ip intellectual property on 3g technology which should finally take off in the next few years and which should earn significant amounts of money for qualcomm
1384283 numbers are lower than in athens partly because we have fewer tickets to sell
1384284 in 2004 we could sell 45 000 tickets and because it was in the european union we also had access to all the tickets that were being sold to the greek public we will have enough fans in the crowd and we have a huge contingent of supporters within the team if athletes have the time to support their team mates we will certainly facilitate that
1384285 prices are too high and hotels are costing between six and 10 times more than normal
1384286 but we think that interest after the games will explode
1384287 it could be that britons know they will have a chance to see the olympics on their own doorstep in just four years and they may not have been prepared to travel a long way for these games
1384288 it may be the same with the soccer world cup with people who were happy to travel to germany for the 2006 championships not so keen to go to south africa for the 2010 event

1384291 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through

1384298 the content industry in suing cablevision once again overreached in its goal to limit the personal uses of increasingly popular technology
1384299 we hope this case will be another signal to hollywood to scale back its attacks on consumer friendly technologies
1384300 cablevision has no control over what programs are made available on individual channels or when those programs will air if at all
1384301 in this respect cablevision possesses far less control over recordable content than it does in the vod context where it actively selects and makes available beforehand the individual programs available for viewing
1384302 the cable companies have done just about all they can to damage tivo by keeping them outside the fraternity
1384303 people who are buying tivo are doing it despite all the obstacles the cable tv companies are putting in front of them and i dont think this will much change that

1384306 comcast isnt the first and certainly wont be the last isp to meddle surreptitiously with its subscribers internet communications for its own benefit
1384307 the concept is to provide airlines with an aircraft that is smaller than a 747 which is too big for many secondary city pairs or linking a major hub with a secondary city such as singapore to manchester london to san diego or even toulouse to boston
1384308 the idea is to avoid the hubbing and spoking you require for the profitable operation of 747s
1384309 debe ser facilitada por el mencionado registro de la fundaci n v emf una vez hayan sido calificados o por la entidad que las presente o sea la fundaci n de la cual la generalitat solo forma parte de su patronato junto a otras instituciones y su representaci n no es mayoritaria
1384310 una vez m s el conseller huye en lugar de dar una respuesta ante los representantes de la ciudadan a excus ndose en el registro de fundaciones o en la propia fundaci n de la que forma parte la generalitat junto a la diputaci n y el ayuntamiento de valencia las tres instituciones gobernadas por su mismo partido
1384311 vergonzosa y deja muy claro el oscurantismo de la gesti n econ mica del consell
1384312 ni siquiera ha respondido a la pregunta de cu l ha sido la aportaci n final total de la generalitat al patronato de la fundaci n v emf
1384313 no es preciso consultar los papeles de la fundaci n basta con mirar las propias cuentas de la generalitat
1384314 es significativo que a pesar de que el 61 por ciento de los clientes posee coche los viajeros prefieren utilizar los trenes de cercan as como medio de transporte durante los d as laborables por motivos de comodidad y precio

1384319 necesita un gran evento casi cada mes para salvar as cifras de visitantes y negocio tur stico en valencia
1384320 peculiaridad del destino y lo que se puede encontrar en l
1384321 no o mos que haya planes municipales ni estrategia de coordinaci n con las asociaciones sectoriales y los agentes econ micos y sociales relacionados con el turismo en la ciudad de valencia como existen en otras ciudades como sevilla madrid o barcelona
1384322 ofrece cada a o seis millones de euros a turismo valencia convention bureau para la promoci n de la ciudad
1384323 muchas veces da la impresi n de que el gobierno local compite con las otras administraciones en lugar de colaborar y coordinarse
1384324 parece que se est en estado de guerra con reproches y comentarios negativos
1384325 si los planes de maquillaje de la ciudad para un escenario determinado como si fuera un parque tem tico son buenos para los turistas tambi n lo ser para los ciudadanos
1384326 no se puedan considerar de segunda frente al mimo y esmero con el que se cuida a los turistas
1384327 ese car cter l dico festivo en donde damos a conocer la pobla del duc reivindicando al tiempo la tradici n vitivin cola a nivel internacional no s lo de esta comarca sino de la comunidad entera

1384331 ltimamente la estrategia victimista del presidente de la generalitat francisco camps hace aguas ya que hasta el presidente del pp mariano rajoy desmonta y pone en entredicho sus argumentos
1384332 en evidencia al mostrarse contrario a que los aeropuertos valencianos formen parte de la gesti n auton mica tal y como hab a pedido reiteradamente el consell
1384333 dej caer tambi n su apoyo al presidente de la diputaci n de castell n alberto fabra con argumentos disparatados que llegaban al absurdo al defender el aeropuerto de castell n aunque no sea rentable
1384334 devolvi la pelota al secretario general del ppcv ricardo costa al decir que la direcci n regional del pp tiene suficiente autonom a para actuar contra los tr nsfugas de d nia cuando el secretario general del ppcv dijo hace una semana que la decisi n estaba en manos de la direcci n nacional
1384335 el colmo del discurso contradictorio lo representan algunos cargos p blicos de esta comunitat que siguen usando las instituciones para apoyar pol ticamente a la que ha sido declarada como alcaldesa tr nsfuga por la comisi n de seguimiento del pacto antitransfuguismo con el voto de apoyo del propio pp
1384336 es una posici n nueva pero estoy a gusto intentar acoplarme lo m s pronto posible como lateral
1384337 es una situaci n nueva para m pero estoy a gusto y creo que estoy trabajando bien as que intentar acoplarme lo m s pronto posible como lateral en cuanto a las diferencias entre un sitio y otro cambia un poco a la hora de la marca y de estar pendiente de la l nea defensiva pero todo eso se puede ir mejorando
1384338 lo m s importante es que el mister me ha dicho que conf a en m y eso me motiva porque tener opciones de jugar en el villarreal es muy complicado ya que es un club que est en constante crecimiento y los fichajes que llegan son de alt simo nivel
1384339 mi objetivo ser mejorar en todos los sentidos para tratar de sumar minutos en el campo
1384340 voy a demostrar a la directiva que no se han equivocado conmigo con la renovaci n y que voy a rendir donde se me pida
1384341 para que me vaya todos deben poner algo de su parte
1384342 nunca antes na cidade de s o paulo n s fizemos tantos investimentos na cria o de novas vagas em creches quero saber o que a candidata marta fez em rela o a isso
1384343 n o vamos responder esses desafios estamos mais preocupados em pensar em como a marta poder resolver o problema da falta de vagas nas escolas municipais
1384344 no s lo tendr an que ser registradas para poder defenderlas sino tambi n deber an formar parte de un plan para la conservaci n y fomento del patrimonio intelectual que es el pilar del progreso de los autores
1384345 de forma inminente para evitar problemas futuros adem s de mejorar la accesibilidad
1384346 yo vivo en valencia he aprendido el valenciano en la escuela hablo por supuesto castellano y lo hablo indistintamente de forma natural como la gran mayor a de los ciudadanos de esa tierra
1384347 no hay mejor prueba que observar c mo se disparan las cifras del desempleo para comprobar que las pseudomedidas que aport el ejecutivo para paliar la crisis no tienen ni la m s m nima eficacia en esta coyuntura econ mica que requiere de verdaderas manos expertas y no de peque os ensayos en macroeconom a
1384348 a zapatero le estamos pagando entre todos los espa oles un master en econom a de estado y aunque seguro que al final acaba aprendiendo algo lo har a costa del empobrecimiento del pa s y del derrumbe total del estado del bienestar
1384349 el aumento del n mero de desempleados un 1 5 por ciento durante el mes de julio no es
1384350 tras meses de debacle econ mica los ciudadanos ya s lo esperan lo peor del gobierno socialista que parece haberlos abandonado a su suerte y destino
1384351 alcanzar los dos millones y medio de parados es el fruto de la frivolidad que el ejecutivo socialista ha mantenido en materia econ mica y significa que en espa a hay dos millones y medio de familias que sufren y padecen a causa de la ineptitud del gobierno de rodr guez zapatero
1384352 para qu iba a acudir el grupo popular a la ciudad alemana
1384353 hacer lo mismo que hicieron ellos hacer turismo a costa del erario p blico
1384354 s lo ha servido tambi n para que el alcalde de aquella ciudad haya venido a valencia en fallas alguna vez y creo que en una ocasi n vino una banda de m sica de la polic a de maguncia
1384355 esos son los importantes actos cient ficos econ micos y culturales del hermanamiento con aquella ciudad
1384356 no se qu beneficios esper bamos obtener los valencianos por mandar una delegaci n a maguncia a celebrar el aniversario ya que no bamos a traer turistas de aquella ciudad alemana ni a realizar ning n intercambio con la universidad de all ni a reinventar la imprenta
1384357 no pueden ensuciar la v a p blica dejando los residuos en la calle su obligaci n es retirarlos y depositarlos en los contenedores
1384358 deben dejar limpia la v a p blica de los residuos que genera su actividad y han de ser tambi n los m s interesados en que la ciudad se encuentre en las mejores condiciones de limpieza para el turismo y principalmente para sus ciudadanos
1384359 si bien este a o va a coincidir con la preparaci n del gran premio de europa de automovilismo
1384360 los titulares de establecimientos sean no fijos tales como bares caf s quioscos puestos de venta y similares est n obligados a mantener en las debidas condiciones de limpieza tanto las propias instalaciones como el espacio urbano sometido a su influencia
1384361 en principio los inspectores realizar n visitas de cortes a para informar
1384362 imposici n de multas y en caso de que no se abonasen los establecimientos sancionados no podr n instalar mesas y sillas al a o siguiente dado que no se permite a los que no han respetado la normativa el a o anterior
1384363 se ha mostrado totalmente favorable a este tipo de campa as de concienciaci n y de cumplimiento de la normativa
1384364 se est n realizando en toda la ciudad y ya vamos por la segunda campa a de limpiezas intensivas en todos los barrios
1384365 se ha convertido en una obsesi n la eliminaci n del ltimo baluarte de su predecesor eduardo zaplana
1384366 en la batalla de alicante se juega el control del partido
1384367 la campa a de sms lanzada por los campsistas no es m s que el reflejo de la lucha interna entre ambos bandos
1384368 mientras los zaplanistas sigan en la direcci n del partido en alicante camps jam s estar tranquilo
1384369 los fieles de zaplana con ripoll a la cabeza a n esperan venganza
1384370 camps como le sucede en castell n con carlos fabra sabe que
1384371 ya ha dado sobradas muestras de que no piensa dejar despejado el camino al presidente del ppcv
1384372 de poco le va a servir la in dita campa a de movilizaci n
1384373 est dispuesto a defender hasta el ltimo minuto el basti n zaplanista
1384374 no puede seguir vendiendo unidad cuando es un partido roto enfrentado y dividido sin soluci n de continuidad
1384375 est perjudicando a los valencianos que est n viendo como camps s lo es capaz de liderar y a duras penas la crisis de su partido
1384376 the personnel entered a second floor meeting room unaware that siddiqui was being held there unsecured behind a curtain
1384377 shortly after the meeting began the captain heard a woman yell from the curtain and when he turned saw siddiqui holding the warrant officers rifle and pointing it directly at the captain
1384378 the interpreter seated closest to siddiqui lunged at her and pushed the rifle away as siddiqui pulled the trigger siddiqui fired at least two shots but no one was hit the warrant officer returned fire with a 9 mm service pistol and fired approximately two rounds at siddiquis torso hitting her at least once
1384379 thinking that she had explosives and would attack them as a suicide bomber shot her and and took her
1384380 her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was ever accused of
1384381 for a long time my family and i have kept our silence because we knew she was innocent and also based on threats of severe consequences if we spoke
1384382 m s que dividirnos nos hace hablar de pol tica de futuro y sobre todo como yo he hecho desde el primer d a de recuperar el gobierno de la generalitat que es mi objetivo real
1384383 debe hacerse sin exclusiones al igual que la configuraci n de los equipos que van a dirigir el partido
1384384 creo que es necesario que antes de hablar de equipos concretemos bien nuestro proyecto hablemos de la ponencia marco y concretemos el marco program tico en el que se mover nuestro partido para los pr ximos 20 a os
1384385 tienen que responder a este marco para que nuestro trabajo discurso y oferta pol tica sea com n coherente y til para la ciudadan a

1384388 the u s dollar is enjoying broad based gains as commodity prices continue to decline and economic data from europe disappoint
1384389 the fed remains handcuffed by weak economic activity from an ongoing credit crunch and uncomfortably high inflation the accompanying press statement will probably see little change from the june 25 communiqu
1384390 admittedly oil has dropped by over 17 from its peak suggesting that the fed should be less concerned about its impact on inflation expectations
1384391 however note that the fed cut rates to 2 as insurance against a severe credit crisis the fed is likely to question if rates need to be kept so low as credit conditions stabilize
1384392 these figures will do nothing to quell fears that the economy is sliding towards negative growth and the prospect of a technical recession looks increasingly likely
1384393 further slow down of market growth in the main market of us

1384396 the games that we are looking forward to considering for presentation will be demos of prototypes games with experimental elements that have already been released or that are planned for release and games developed by students who have hit upon something out of the ordinary there will be no distinctions made whatsoever between professionals and amateurs we welcome submissions of games created by small venture businesses as well as doujin games developed by individuals
1384397 as i had hoped i was able to overtake three cars on the first lap but later it became more difficult than expected to race with the heavy car
1384398 we went for a one stop strategy so my car was almost full of fuel at the start and i also had to take care of the tyres i couldnt match the pace of the cars in front of me now we have to analyse the lack of race pace normally this is one of our strengths
1384399 hes well past ladybirds hes into snails now and other stuff like that im sure we will see even more gruesome insects going in there this year
1384400 my sister sent me a text on thursday to ask are you at that open thingy yet

1384407 very sorry we made it a little more difficult for you we just wanted to give you the opportunity of driving a great racing car well done
1384408 it was the first time i have ever been booed walking on to a cricket field so it was quite motivating and i am very satisfied to have a hundred under my belt
1384409 it does look a confused selection i felt sorry for him because hed obviously not been in the set up around the environment and didnt know anyone that makes it very very difficult for him to play
1384410 vaughany just felt we needed a bowler to give us a full length because the pitch looked as if it was going to be slow
1384411 i like king prawns with a bit of garlic and i dont mind lobster but vaughan the prawn whats all that about who writes these headlines
1384412 hundreds of our fans turned up this morning and im really really glad it went the right way i wouldnt have wanted to be here otherwise
1384413 i like steak and kidney pie but i wouldnt want it every day of the week if your wife made you it on monday great again the next day fine but youd be fit to throw it at her by the end of the week
1384414 the track will be as slippery as a rolex salesman in a garage sale
1384415 i probably tried hitting it too hard instead of easing it for four i tried to hit it for eight
1384416 the ground isnt as cold as it was this could be because its warmer

1384428 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties
1384429 hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again
1384430 mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1384431 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1384432 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1384433 president bush he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he said cheney go take care of this
1384434 the time frame is that the benefit if there is any from screening is 10 years
1384435 the average life expectancy for men over 75 years is less than 10 years so screening them can do more harm than good

1384437 i know a lot of people arent looking at me dix said
1384438 the competitors who compete against me i dont think theyre overlooking me but i think a lot of the media is hyping the competition that allows me to maybe sneak in there and make things happen
1384439 well hey thats called athletic sport theres been a lot of picks in a lot of venues where the underdog won and hes no underdog

1384443 to win a different type of major win three opens in a row i havent begun to think about this but certainly there are plenty of options out there to set yourself apart win five opens
1384444 im going to have to sit down and reassess my goals
1384445 i got up this morning and when i was eating my porridge i got the computer on and started looking at the ryder cup table
1384446 i think i had avoided looking over the last four weeks because my position was quite perilous
1384447 its now a great position when you are at the top and you can look at these things and you can watch other people sweating but when your down there sweating its not much fun
1384448 now i can sit back for the next couple of months and watch the other guys battling it out to make the team

1384460 la primera vez que intent prepararlo me salio fatal bueno la primera y la segunda y la tercera no es que sea muy dif cil pero hay tener ma a para calcular bien la cantidad de t y az car y para hacer la espuma se vierte el t de un vaso a otro desde cierta altura y es f cil que se salga fuera y ponga perdida la bandeja
1384461 the first time that i tried to prepare a cup of tea was terrible well the first time and the second and the third it is not that difficult but you must calculate precisely the quantity of tea and sugar and make the foam you have to pour out the tea from a certain elevation and then it easily spills out and makes a mess of your platter
1384462 the new hostel is light bright positive and dignified and i can tell what a difference it will make to the residents who are here i cant believe how much it has changed we didnt even know the project was open i believe it is now down to us to acknowledge that things have changed
1384463 we are glad to have the opportunity to welcome the local community into our newly reopened hostel
1384464 st mungos endell street hostel is committed to providing the very best care and support to its residents whilst offering excellent resources for the local community with space for community meetings local clubs and societies
1384465 the new endell street has come a long way in a short space of time what was a jaded hostel building has been transformed into a place with fewer beds that will play an active role in helping people to recover and move on
1384466 endell street is a key resource in the councils hostel pathway programme and we look forward to working with st mungos to realise the hostels potential as a place of change
1384467 i managed to pull down the layers and couldnt believe my eyes when i saw just rows and rows of plants
1384468 i couldnt see the ground the plants were around 5ft 6in high i could also see that the front window had been covered with some form of thick sheeting
1384469 there were wires everywhere pipes coming from the ceiling and rows of lighting
1384470 im lucky that i discovered the factory when i did the damage was not as bad as it could have been
1384471 the holes in the ceiling ruined carpets water and other damage are currently being repaired and im hoping that the work will be completed fairly shortly
1384472 spending time in gardens can be very beneficial for everyone positively affecting emotions and improving our sense of well being
1384473 beechfield lodge residents absolutely love the new garden i have worked in care for many years now and i have never seen a garden be so popular it looks sounds and smells wonderful it really is a feast for the senses
1384474 distributing this 67 8 million funding to almost 7 000 care homes across england has not only allowed the creation of gardens such as this one but has done much to improve the lives of tens of thousands of people and their families
1384475 the funding is part of the wider dignity in care campaign which aims to place dignity and respect at the heart of caring for older people throughout the campaign i have heard how much dignity matters
1384476 i know how important it is for people living in care homes to have an environment they are happy in and that they are proud to call home
1384477 anchor does a tremendous job it is so important that organisations such as anchor are always trying to improve the care and support that they provide and move it on for the future
1384478 it is obvious that the reputation for quality of care is tremendous here at beechfield lodge and that residents are continuing to have a good quality of life

1384480 as part of our share in tackling climate change camden council works with and encourages all our contractors to make sure they are providing services that are as sustainable as possible
1384481 this pilot is particularly interesting as biomethane is recognised as one of the most climate friendly fuels
1384482 the average household bin is one third food waste rather than send it to landfill or an incinerator we can turn it into a gas called biomethane and run our municipal vehicle fleet on it
1384483 biomethane means virtually no carbon or noxious emissions so its good for the environment and for our air quality this seemed like a dream 18 months ago when camdens sustainability taskforce suggested it but now were trialling both food waste collections and biomethane in our vehicles
1384484 its a sign that the council is serious about cutting the carbon out of camden
1384485 the gas we use to make the cbm for this vehicle comes from a landfill site in albury surrey which began production in june 2008
1384486 in creating and selling this fuel product we recover the latent energy stored in material discarded by society providing power particularly suited to vehicles operating in the urban environment
1384487 cbm has excellent potential to provide at least some of our vehicles with a fuel that reduces climate change impacts and contributes to reducing our dependence on mineral fuels
1384488 we have to look at environmentally friendly alternatives for our operations and gas powered vehicles are one of those developing technologies we are keen to assess
1384489 the aim of this scheme is to bring young people in the south east together to learn about good citizenship the environment and the role of the neighbourhood wardens in a fun and exciting way
1384490 the wardens have worked extremely hard getting this off the ground and im pleased to say the youngsters involved have thoroughly enjoyed their time with us and hopefully gained from it
1384491 i looked out the window and saw the car flipping head over end

1384506 consensuando la transmisi n de la informaci n y los protocolos y pautas de las actuaciones
1384507 se podr a realizar la misma operaci n en la parte opuesta
1384508 esto ya est aprobado pero probablemente tengamos que esperar unos cuatro a os para que la vicepresidenta del gobierno mar a teresa fern ndez de la vega nos diga que lo van a hacer
1384509 eso ya lo firmamos cuando el ministro de defensa era jos bono y de eso ya hace bastante tiempo
1384510 y todo esto teniendo en cuenta que el a o pasado a finales de junio y principios de julio se celebraron las finales de la america s cup por lo que fue un a o excepcional
1384511 aunque es cierto que en los ltimos meses debido a la crisis econ mica el consumo se ha frenado
1384512 tan s lo ha supuesto que el n mero de pasajeros se redujera en el mes de mayo en un 0 2 por ciento respecto al mismo periodo de 2007 y en un 2 1 por ciento en el mes siguiente respecto al a o anterior
1384513 hemos solicitado ayuda al alcalde de madrid alberto ruiz gallard n aunque a n no nos ha contestado no s si porque sigue muy ocupado con su guerra de guerrillas contra esperanza aguirre
1384514 es muy importante rememorar la historia despu s de 40 a os de dicatadura y bastante de democracia ha tenido que venir un gobierno socialista para poner en marcha la ley de la memoria y recuperar la dignidad de la otra parte
1384515 este pa s se merec a que se intentara sin rencor ley para todas las v ctimas de la sinraz n
1384516 es importante recordar los valores de la democracia y que para conseguirla hace falta mantenerla d a a d a no cae del cielo
1384517 esas mujeres no s lo eran rojas eran mujeres y la represi n franquista se ceb mucho m s con ellas hasta arrebatarles la vida
1384518 por eso no queremos someterlas a ellas ni a las v ctimas de la sinraz n a una segunda dictadura la del olvido
1384519 i recorded this song from memory i heard it a long time ago i dont know who wrote it i dont know who sang it i dont know where it came from i dont know why but i just know that i heard it somewhere sometime and i just need to put it back out there you know
1384520 thats good youve been staying abreast write me on myspace no need to feel out of touch im here for you busy working with the band had recorded a lot solo come to the shows and you will find the full array of recorded musical products
1384521 since ive achieved popularity ive written very little since around 2003
1384522 i write all the time in a sense but ive yet to fully express myself as someone who is aware he has an audience i want to address my life today im biding my time staying active ever hopeful that one day i will have a less overwhelming workload
1384523 a human being should be able to change a diaper plan an invasion butcher a hog conn a ship design a building write a sonnet balance accounts build a wall set a bone comfort the dying take orders give orders cooperate act alone solve equations analyze a new problem pitch manure program a computer cook a tasty meal fight efficiently die gallantly specialization is for insects
1384524 why bother learning all that biochemistry stuff or how to design a building or conn a boat or balance accounts or solve equations or comfort the dying when you can get other people to do all that for you in exchange for a blow job
1384525 my eyes were closed and it was bright it was just bam bam and i seen the flashes i mean they were that bright but i figured they were out not on top of the house
1384526 thats all we asked for and the children just loved it
1384527 he came from inner city experiences as well and made it big its a really good example for them and its very important
1384528 live life as it is one day at a time
1384529 youre entering a realm which is unusual maybe its the scary judge story
1384530 i vacillated between three ways of thinking about my marriage 1 this was just the way it was and i should deal with it 2 i had married the wrong person and 3 i had married the right person but i could stay with him only if i could also have the freedom to be with other people
1384531 and i had this moment of are you completely insane shes 16 years his junior shes hot shes much more fun and entertaining than
1384532 the entire idea of being sexually exclusive and wholly possessing our spouses the oneills point out
1384533 my husband can leave me just as easily as anyone elses
1384534 its just that if he wants to see if the grass is greener he can jump over the fence thats all in some ways i think being allowed that freedom keeps him from running off into the next pasture theres no fantasy about what else is out there go ahead look have at it
1384535 in the end i think marriage and relationships all bear striking similarity to one another in that we all face the same issues once we settle down with one person yeah you can leave your wife for your secretary but it wont be long before your secretary turns into your wife
1384536 the straightforwardness of open marriage makes a lot of people uncomfortable
1384537 open marriage is not about leading a life focused on sex its about leading a life free from fretting about it
1384538 i said i wanted to have sex with other people and did and then it evolved into being about more than sex sex was the original motivation i guess i have to concede that point thats what being open is but swinging isnt for me and i guess thats just where i get stuck
1384539 ive had good friends that i thought if i just had sex with them it would turn into a relationship
1384540 some people feel that poly people cannot cheat on their partners
1384541 that is completely false cheating means breaking a promise a poly person who dates or possibly has a one night stand with someone secretly is cheating just as much as any mono person to me they are committing a bigger offense than a cheating mono person
1384542 i may have 20 poly people in my neighborhood and not know it because they dont know about me
1384543 its harder to find someone to date in the suburbs you end up using the internet more you hide certain pieces of yourself and you try to find as much fulfillment as you can
1384544 a lot of people who are willing to try it but dont self identify as poly try it and dont like it and just fall back into what theyre used to
1384545 the cpn group is largely older people maryland d c centric and poly 101 im looking for a social support group people you could call to help you move but being poly in a room together doesnt mean you have things in common
1384546 an erroneous assumption we often hear is that anyone who would let their spouse or partner have sex with another must be a loser lacking in self esteem
1384547 hurtful comments along these lines have been directed at jenny blocks husband christopher in reality most of the time the level of love and trust necessary to permit this kind of sharing and freedom is an indicator of a secure and solid person and relationship
1384548 gets incredibly sad or incredibly angry or both and says youre doing that thing where you let other people define who we are and how things are supposed to be
1384549 it turned out i was more fulfilled with christopher when i was with grace because i no longer wanted something from him that he simply couldnt give me
1384550 as long as those authorities get to define my lifestyle choices as slutty and get to insist that im doomed
1384551 theyre ensuring that other people worry more about avoiding these supposed consequences and protecting their reputations and less about their happiness or the state of our society at large
1384552 people dont want other people to be different and they dont want them to be happy when theyre different because then the implication is that they could live differently too a lot of people just cant face that

1384558 abject academic failure gross financial mismanagement ethical lapses and what amounts to consumer fraud
1384559 the essence of our claim is that this school is basically a scofflaw organization
1384560 these guys are just terrible managers of the public resources that are entrusted to them

1384565 even if the emb says that the level of particulates in the air has decreased the air in metro manila can still be considered polluted

1384571 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
1384572 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
1384573 the scientific community is really going to run with this
1384574 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

1384576 the battle lines for the new world order were exposed at the world trade organization this week the breakdown of the doha round of trade negotiations over a clash between the united states and china and india about farm protection underscores how these new economic giants are changing the balance of power
1384577 i am willing to negotiate commerce but not livelihood security of 650 million subsistence indian farmers
1384578 she went out of the room for sometime and when she returned she simply dug her heels
1384579 after that a us official simply does not show up when negotiations resume and susan schwab heading into the finales of the negotiations stopped off in the press room to get her rebuttal in first
1384580 despite the major negative elements kamal nath told the media that he had accepted the proposals but the us had rejected it
1384581 the trade official who missed the resumption of negotiations was in consultation with schwab at that time
1384582 many ministers officials and diplomats have been speculating that the ssm was not the real issue that was irreconcilable in the most widespread view the us really did not want to face the cotton issue which was the next item on the g 7 agenda once ssm was settled
1384583 it is like accusing us of a crime that we did not commit
1384584 the rights of muslim women in the quran theory and practice
1384585 the quran has innumerable verses in favour of women but men sometimes misinterpret verses related to polygamy and hijab to suit their whims and fancies
1384586 with no access to education most rural muslim women have no idea about the courts and the laws and even what the quran says about womens rights the need of the hour is to take up these cases and help women get their due rights they become easy victims and run from pillar to post when men desert them dump triple talaq on them and irresponsibly use polygamy as their birthright
1384587 it is important to not only use the existing fleet of ice breakers but also to build new ships and the first nuclear ice breaker of a new generation will be built by 2015 this should be an ice breaker capable of moving in rivers and seas
1384588 im concerned we are watching our nations ice breaking capabilities decline
1384589 this dispute is not only about oil reserves which might or might not exist it is about the control of sea lanes russias movements could pitch it into a serious territorial dispute with the us for the first time
1384590 four of the five arctic powers are nato members yet nato seems ill configured to be able to respond to the sort of activities we have seen from the russians we need to ensure nato has the will and the capability to deter russian activity that contravenes international laws or treaties
1384591 the intransigence of great britain has not permitted that open and frank dialogue
1384592 in 1990 all oil production was stopped in east germany as it was not profitable
1384593 now with prices increasing six fold the boom is so big that there is a shortage of oil experts exploration teams are booked out for many months in advance and drilling equipment is totally unavailable for purchase on the market

1384606 we intend to raise awareness about the profound effects of our food choices on the environment on our health and on issues of social justice

1384613 im proud to be a small part of this movement with a vision for a better food system it can help activate people to work to change food policies
1384614 i went to slow food nations parent terra madre in italy
1384615 it was life changing i plan to go to slow food nation because i do not want to miss another chance for a life changing event
1384616 terra madre was a heart event it was a thrill to see families still making the food they have made for centuries you feel this human thing it was very emotional and made me cry some recipes for corn bread for example had been handed down for twenty generations
1384617 i love the apple farmers here in sonoma county they are courageous there is a history here that we need to remember
1384618 slow food is an opportunity to re connect with our food and local growers and to understand the plight our planet is in our immunity and the immune system of the earth are linked building from here is a source of our healing
1384619 it helps create a sense of what real nourishment is it brings farmers children and the community back into the food system rather than leaving it in the hands of large corporations slow food encourages people to grow and cook their own food and remember the pleasure in that
1384620 it was intense being around people from over 150 countries in their traditional dress who have this common bond and language of the land growing food preserving local food cultures preparing serving and nourishing others
1384621 they have a delicious heritage bean they so inspired me that i bought them as christmas presents and included information about slow food
1384622 i traded them for tomatoes of which i have many
1384623 we need to do more foraging and gleaning lots of food is wasted on the ground which is very edible
1384624 have a long history yet are mostly ignored by the culinary mainstream

1384629 we owe it to the filipino people to explain the agreements details
1384630 the government should explain every detail of the agreement because it is something that concerns the filipino people especially with this long standing problem of relationship with the muslims
1384631 it could be properly discussed and probably a compromise could be made to prevent any trouble in the future
1384632 i think weve kind of hit the nail on the head
1384633 its easy for baristas to implement and its easy for customers to understand

1384664 it is hard to diagnose the anemia of chronic disease

1384667 our hypothesis was that certain non toxic dietary agents that had the ability to promote reactive oxygen species ros would break down pancreatic cancer cell resistance to therapy following administration of mda 7 il 24 and be safe for human use
1384668 we are very excited at the prospect of this chemoprevention gene therapy as a means of both preventing and treating pancreatic cancer and it has significant potential to move rapidly into human clinical trials

1384670 two years ago our hospital performed new yorks first three way kidney swap since then 11 additional patients have received kidneys as part of the program now as our kidney swap program continues to expand including through this milestone four way swap we will bring more kidneys to the patients that need them and make them available sooner than they would have otherwise
1384671 the duraheart gives us a new third generation option for patients with advanced heart failure who need help to allow them to survive until they can receive a heart transplant
1384672 this trial will test the durahearts potential to overcome some of the issues that have been seen with other devices including hemolysis caused by shear stress on red blood cells and clotting risk caused by blood that does not circulate rapidly enough from all areas of the chamber
1384673 it also remains to be seen if this device offers superior durability which might make it useful as a destination therapy that could remove the need for a heart transplant

1384679 northcliffes journalists have been providing video news for up to two and a half years at least 50 of northcliffes websites will carry truly local video content by september when a rollout of the companys next generation internet publishing platform is complete
1384680 the bbcs claims that it will introduce a new level of local video news gathering do not stand up to scrutiny as many of the local video sites mirror areas covered by regional newspapers and their websites

1384699 i think its on the verge of being approved by both boards
1384700 within the limits of a public highway without first obtaining the written consent of the chief of police
1384701 the statute makes no mention of traffic safety or any other purpose justifying the restrictions and sets forth no standards based on the characteristics of a proposed sign the states assertion that the statute sets forth clear standards is simply not supported by the plain language of the statute
1384702 ultimately allowing the statute to stand would be an endorsement of a trust me because i am the chief of police standard
1384703 i thought it outrageous that a police chief could decide who may or may not post political signs and then tear down those he disapproved of now the court has found it is also unconstitutional
1384704 i just felt it would be better to have an opposing point of view

1384710 necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves
1384711 i have had my solutions for a long time but i do not yet know how i am to arrive at them
1384712 whatever evils either reason or declamation have imputed to extensive empire the power of rome was attended with some beneficial consequences to mankind and the same freedom of intercourse which extended the vices diffused likewise the improvements of social life
1384713 augustus was sensible that mankind is governed by names nor was he deceived in his expectation that the senate and people would submit to slavery provided they were respectfully assured that they still enjoyed their ancient freedom
1384714 there exists in human nature a strong propensity to depreciate the advantages and to magnify the evils of the present times
1384715 our youth now loves luxuries they have bad manners contempt for authority they show disrespect for elders and they love to chatter instead of exercise children are now tyrants not the servants of their households they no longer rise when elders enter the room they contradict their parents chatter before company gobble up their food and tyrannize their teachers
1384716 before impugning an opponents motives even when they legitimately may be impugned answer his arguments
1384717 idealism alas does not protect one from ignorance dogmatism and foolishness
1384718 let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that i am persecuted whenever i am contradicted
1384719 we take and must continue to take morally hazardous actions to preserve our civilization we must exercise our power but we ought neither to believe that a nation is capable of perfect disinterestedness in its exercise nor become complacent about particular degrees of interest and passion which corrupt the justice by which the exercise of power is legitimized
1384720 faced with the choice of all the land without a jewish state or a jewish state without all the land we chose a jewish state without all the land
1384721 the darkest places in hell are reserved for those who maintain their neutrality in times of moral crisis
1384722 he too serves a certain purpose who only stands and cheers
1384723 the law in its majestic equality forbids the rich as well as the poor to beg in the streets steal bread or sleep under a bridge
1384724 when bad men combine the good must associate else they will fall one by one an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle
1384725 education does not mean that we have become certified experts in business or mining or botany or journalism or epistemology it means that through the absorption of the moral intellectual and esthetic inheritance of the race we have come to understand and control ourselves as well as the external world that we have chosen the best as our associates both in spirit and the flesh that we have learned to add courtesy to culture wisdom to knowledge and forgiveness to understanding
1384726 glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore
1384727 the most important political office is that of the private citizen
1384728 if we desire respect for the law we must first make the law respectable
1384729 we can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we cant have both
1384730 it is an error to suppose that books have no influence it is a slow influence like flowing water carving out a canyon but it tells more and more with every year and no one can pass an hour a day in the society of sages and heroes without being lifted up a notch or two by the company he has kept
1384731 when you write youre trying to transpose what youre thinking into something that is less like an annoying drone and more like a piece of music
1384732 i contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole american people which declared that their legislature should make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof thus building a wall of separation between church and state
1384733 the sum of our religion is peace and unanimity but these can scarcely stand unless we define as little as possible and in many things leave one free to follow his own judgment because there is great obscurity in many matters and man suffers from this almost congenital disease that he will not give in when once a controversy is started and after he is heated he regards as absolutely true that which he began to sponsor quite casually
1384734 are we to have a censor whose imprimatur shall say what books may be sold and what we may buy and who is thus to dogmatize religious opinions for our citizens whose foot is to be the measure to which ours are all to be cut or stretched is a priest to be our inquisitor or shall a layman simple as ourselves set up his reason as the rule of what we are to read and what we must disbelieve
1384735 we are told that it is only peoples objective actions that matter and their subjective feelings are of no importance thus pacifists by obstructing the war effort are objectively aiding the nazis and therefore the fact that they may be personally hostile to fascism is irrelevant i have been guilty of saying this myself more than once the same argument is applied to trotskyism trotskyists are often credited at any rate by communists with being active and conscious agents of hitler but when you point out the many and obvious reasons why this is unlikely to be true the objectively line of talk is brought forward again to criticize the soviet union helps hitler therefore trotskyism is fascism and when this has been established the accusation of conscious treachery is usually repeated this is not only dishonest it also carries a severe penalty with it if you disregard peoples motives it becomes much harder to foresee their actions
1384736 wouldnt this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive if needy were a turn on
1384737 the great thing about human language is that it prevents us from sticking to the matter at hand
1384738 to be ignorant of what happened before you were born is to be ever a child for what is mans lifetime unless the memory of past events is woven with those of earlier times
1384739 reputation is what other people know about you honor is what you know about yourself
1384740 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1384741 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1384742 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1384743 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1384744 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1384745 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1384746 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1384747 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1384748 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1384749 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1384750 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1384751 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1384752 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1384753 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1384754 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1384755 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1384756 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1384757 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1384758 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1384759 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1384760 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1384761 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1384762 was sent to new york on a project for the book
1384763 detained by federal agents in manhattan he was interrogated and his notes were confiscated violations of his first and fourth amendment rights
1384764 karl just went from prime minister to king amazing and a little scary now no one will speak candidly about him or take him on or contradict him pure power no real accountability its just listen to karl and everything will work out that may go for the president too
1384765 there is no precedent in any modern white house for what is going on in this one a complete lack of a policy apparatus
1384766 what youve got is everything and i mean everything being run by the political arm its the reign of the mayberry machiavellis
1384767 i heard many many staff discussions but not three meaningful substantive policy discussions
1384768 there were no actual policy white papers on domestic issues there were truth be told only a couple of people in the west wing who worried at all about policy substance and analysis and they were even more overworked than the stereotypical nonstop twenty hour a day white house staff every modern presidency moves on the fly but on social policy and related issues the lack of even basic policy knowledge and the only casual interest in knowing more was somewhat breathtaking discussions by fairly senior people who meant medicaid but were talking medicare near instant shifts from discussing any actual policy pros and cons to discussing political communications media strategy et cetera even quite junior staff would sometimes hear quite senior staff pooh pooh any need to dig deeper for pertinent information on a given issue
1384769 besides the tax cut which was cut and dried during the campaign
1384770 and the education bill which was really a ted kennedy bill the administration has not done much either in absolute terms or in comparison with previous administrations at this stage on domestic policy there is a virtual absence as yet of any policy accomplishments that might to a fair minded nonpartisan count as the flesh on the bones of so called compassionate conservatism there is still two years maybe six for them to do more and better on domestic policy and specifically on the compassion agenda and needless to say 9 11 and now the global war on terror and the new homeland and national security plans must be weighed in the balance but as i think andy card himself told you in so many words even allowing for those huge contextual realities they could stand to find ways of inserting more serious policy fiber into the west wing diet and engage much less in on the fly policy making by speechmaking
1384771 we will fuck him do you hear me we will fuck him we will ruin him like no one has ever fucked him
1384772 but you have to put it past you and move on
1384773 those guys can tell you all about what happened as for history
1384774 i think it will little note nor long remember and all that
1384775 john will never work in the republican party again thanks to karl
1384776 like me all the moderate republicans have been run out of the party by the right im doing what ive always done politically these guys just call themselves democrats now
1384777 in the voice of three people hani 1 hani 2 and hani 3
1384778 what people ate or wore or trifling things they said
1384779 echoed at the top of cia and was of course briefed to the president and vice president
1384780 one of the top operatives plotting and planning death and destruction on the united states
1384781 why the hell did the president have to put us in a box like this
1384782 if theres a one percent chance that pakistani scientists are helping al qaeda build or develop a nuclear weapon we have to treat it as a certainty in terms of our response
1384783 rely on impulse and improvisation to a degree that was without precedent for a modern president
1384784 their jobs were not to help shape policy but to affirm it
1384785 swept up the suspicious or simply the unfortunate by the stadiumful and caught almost no one who was actually a danger to america
1384786 bin ladens cheney the older man who made sure that ideas were carried to action
1384787 if it turns out to be zawahiris head i hope youll bring it here
1384788 youre not going to let me lose face on this are you
1384789 was fixated on how to get zubaydah to tell us the truth
1384790 thousands of uniformed men and women raced in a panic to each target
1384791 the united states would torture a mentally disturbed man and then leap screaming at every word he uttered
1384792 nelsinho teve sorte e m ritos ao se colocar na 2 posi o
1384793 acho que para mim seria muito mais valioso ser titular para ter o aprendizado completo e ganhar experi ncia preciso aprender mais do tr fego de corrida da classifica o e daquelas coisas que voc n o s conseguer aprender nos testes muito f cil fazer uma volta r pida mas muito duro realizar esse tempo na qualifica o ent o espero ter uma boa oportunidade para correr
1384794 eu tenho uma parceria com a red bull e n o devo envolver assuntos particulares com neg cios por m se bruno for claramente o melhor candidato conversaremos se ele for o campe o da gp2 ent o n o precisar de seu nome
1384795 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
1384796 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
1384797 we have a long way to go right now we are just preparing to have success this season and i think that is what we will do its definitely fun playing with those guys
1384798 a style of computing where it related capabilities are provided as a service using internet technologies to multiple external customers it allows users to access technology enabled services without knowledge of expertise with or control over the technology infrastructure that supports them
1384799 we are delighted that jason accepted our offer to come and join a squad that is bristling with excitement for the coming season
1384800 jasons qualities speak for themselves and he has a canny knack in making the scoreboard tick
1384801 when i came up to leeds last week to meet with andy and neil i could see there were lots of good things happening at the club
1384802 its going to be a tough challenge but it is a great opportunity for me and hopefully i will be able to help leeds get back to where they need to be
1384803 there are some very good sides in national one like exeter and cornish pirates and i know it will be a very competitive league
1384804 the difference between the premiership and national one is that week in week out its a tough old slog but it is definitely a challenge that i am looking forward to
1384805 from a team perspective losing brad is a big blow for all of us
1384806 he is an outstanding super 14 player a good guy with great leadership qualities but we are not going to hold him back
1384807 the sharks is my home where i grew up but this is a unique opportunity as a young guy to broaden my horizons
1384808 i want to emphasise the point that i am not turning my back on the sharks or springbok rugby
1384809 this is a unique opportunity for me as a young player to grow and improve by playing in different conditions
1384810 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1384811 were still kind of on the tail end of our family including wife shelley daughter taylor and son caden vacation that weve spent in our monaco coach traveling around the country since norwalk ohio june 29 we just left pismo beach in california
1384812 we were there for a week and were all back in the motor home heading to brainerd
1384813 its been very relaxing and fun but you have to balance that with showing up at the race track to race
1384814 however especially with three races left in this countdown chase were not completely safe in the top 10
1384815 its a lot fun being in brainerd a lot of us racers get on the golf carts and go to the zoo brainerds famous campground and see the fans at night and we have a great time but then you have to be focused to show up on sunday and race
1384816 right now we are also focused on moving ourselves up in the top 10
1384817 if we can stay on course and keep running as well as we have been lately we can fight into the top five come indianapolis you do not want to be teetering on the no 9 or 10 spot because we also have the showdown bonus event at indy for 100 000 wed like to win again
1384818 also now that were running to 1000 feet its completely changed everybodys mindset i really believe the racing has been better obviously its been safer but i think the fans are now understanding that changing the racing to 1000 feet was a great choice for the time being
1384819 there are a lot of things at this time of the season that can provide distractions if you let them so we dont want to have to go into indianapolis fighting to stay in the top 10 wed like to go in there fighting to stay in the top five and then be able to be a cheerleader and help our don schumacher racing teammates gary scelzi jack beckman clinging to no 10 and jerry toliver fight their way into the top 10
1384820 nothing else mattered weve worked all season to make sure that doesnt happen again right now were okay were not a lock to make the countdown so every qualifying run we make this coming weekend at the nhra lucas oil nationals in brainerd min is critically important and every round of racing on sunday is even more so
1384821 there are just three races remaining until the top 10 riders in pro stock motorcycle are locked in for the countdown to the championship and every member of our snap on tools wyotech technical schools suzuki team is just as determined as i am that were going to be a part of that
1384822 its amazing the way things work weve raced all year to be in the top 10 to qualify for the countdown and then well have to push even harder to try and win the powerade championship
1384823 it may be a clich but it really is true that if this was easy everyone would be doing it the quality of competition in pro stock motorcycle is mind boggling there are maybe a dozen riders who are regulars on the nhra powerade series circuit who are capable of winning on any given sunday so that means we have to be on the top of our game every time out man talk about your pressure cooker situations this is it
1384824 that sounds good right now but lets see where we are after this weekends race maybe at that point ill be able to breathe a little easier
1384825 road america is my one of my favorite tracks in the us but unfortunately is not a place where i have enjoyed much success on race day hopefully we will be able to fix that this time around
1384826 this track is really one of the best road courses in the us and in fact there really arent many circuits like this anymore in the world with a 4 mile lap it is a place that i have always enjoyed driving on and im looking forward to racing the panasonic acura here this weekend
1384827 we have been on the front row in all three of our races so far the highlight being on pole at the last round but given the nature of this place with its very long straights keeping that record going will be a challenge because of the p1 cars straight line speed advantage
1384828 mid ohio was a very traumatic time for our team and we will be looking to bounce back here not just for us but for jonesie as well
1384829 road america is certainly my favorite track i clinched my atlantic championship here and last year in champ car i was quite competitive
1384830 we will have a low downforce package this weekend on our acura the first time we have tried that on the car so working hard on our mechanical set up will be really important this weekend as well
1384831 road america is a very different type of challenge compared to mid ohio we have a long race but you do have some time to breath on the straights
1384832 the carousel is certainly my favorite part of the track it was almost flat in a champ car a really challenging type of corner
1384833 obviously we will be looking to regroup after what happened at mid ohio weve all been through quite an emotional time and we hope to see keith back with us soon
1384834 we turned the corner in terms of performance several races ago
1384835 the rockstar energy drink dodge is running better and qualifying better and were starting to go rounds
1384836 i look at the situation and i approach it professionally
1384837 were going into brainerd with our eyes wide open with the attitude that if we can have a couple of good races well be good to go brainerd is a lot of fun especially their campground the zoo its legendary brainerd has always been a good stop good fans a good facility and everyone enjoys going there
1384838 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1384839 my opponent wants to set a date to come home i want us to come home with victory and honor so we will never go back again
1384840 when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation theyre gonna become energy independent
1384841 id like to thank all of you for your support of our troops and heres why im many things in my life and one thing id like to be is your first lady but more importantly im jack mccains mother and jimmy mccains mother one in the u s navy and another one in the marine corps an iraqi vet
1384842 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as both the first lady and miss buffalo chip
1384843 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1384844 gt more information on touch diamond and raphael for both sprint and verizon
1384845 gt htc to launch touch diamond with sprint this month android phones in q4
1384846 after lamenting the missed opportunity to make dick cheney his own vice president in 2001 mccain will have a chance to choose his very own cheney said dnc spokesman brad woodhouse
1384847 we think its important that the american people have all the facts at their fingertips when it comes to john mccain and his vice presidential pick this site gives reporters voters and activists a chance to review the record and see for themselves that no matter who he picks a mccain ticket means more of the same for families already struggling to pay out of control energy costs keep their jobs and stay in their homes
1384848 this is very suggestive that there is a fundamental change going on in the electorate
1384849 obviously these are not good numbers for the party to be looking at
1384850 i think the key in this one is where do all these new independent voters break
1384851 i think right now youve got a guy in western pennsylvania saying i am really disgusted right now and im not going to register as a republican anymore but i really dont want this guy obama elected
1384852 i think nationally and here people are kind of tired of the way this administration has been conducting the policies of this country
1384853 thecheappop com is a terrific site for pop culture news with lots of original material all written with wit and good nature its been running strong since october 2005 in web terms a near miracle of staying power
1384854 11 59 and had a song featured in the 2007 feature
1384855 thecheappop com is a terrific site for pop culture news with lots of original material all written with wit and good nature its been running strong since october 2005 in web terms a near miracle of staying power
1384856 dif cil pensar que a renault esteja no mesmo n vel que os grandes complicado melhor tanto ap s um ano mesmo com as mudan as de regulamento nunca vamos ver um time que era um dos piores entre os l deres as melhoras precisam ser feitas passo a passo e as equipes grandes tem uma grande vantagem todos v o ter de trabalhar muito para alcan los
1384857 agora estou concentrado na temporada atual mas tenho que ver as possibilidades para o futuro e tomara que consiga voltar a vencer o quanto antes mas as pessoas querem uma coisa enquanto a realidade outra diziam que a renault ia voltar a vencer com quando eu voltasse e olhem o que aconteceu
1384858 im not giving the gavel away to a tactic that supports the oil companies
1384859 the reserve should only be used in the event of an emergency and that we shouldnt be tapping the reserve to provide a small short term decrease in gas prices
1384860 democrat barack obama called today for tapping the nations strategic oil reserves to help drive down gasoline prices a shift from his previous position on the issue
1384861 s lo porque no oyes el sonido de la m quina de escribir no significa que no est escribiendo
1384862 even though its a road course there are some places where you can really drop the hammer
1384863 the backstraight is a perfect example you come flying down through there and hit the inner loop
1384864 if were going to make a move it has to start this weekend
1384865 weve got five more races before the chase starts so we cant afford to finish outside the top five in any of those races even then its going to be a long shot so we might as well go for broke
1384866 ill tell you this tony george owner of the indianapolis motor speedway said that they werent changing the track and i dont blame them its expensive to pave the track but diamond grinding the race track with the grooves does directly have an effect on tire wear directly and anyone who wants to say otherwise is just in denial all right so with that said obviously i wouldnt expect tony to repave the race track even though they did diamond grind it for no good reason
1384867 pocono is a tough tough race track to get a hold of more so than indy
1384868 thats why we picked it to test instead of indianapolis its not that the teams didnt want to test there there were more important places to go
1384869 after qualifying a disappointing 22nd i still felt strongly that wintron racing had provided me with a car that was capable of finishing in a top five position
1384870 once the race got the green and we were able to finish a few laps it became pretty clear to me that we just did not have a car that was going to be much of a factor
1384871 i was working hard in the a casola farms dodge but we were just not making progress it was clear to me that we had a mid pack car and that was the best i could hope for it was disappointing to me knowing how hard we had all worked
1384872 it seemed that our dodge was way down on power compared to the toyotas and some of the fords the team kept trying all day to make some changes that would improve our performance but it just did not happen
1384873 with some attrition and having run a very clean race staying out of trouble we had the car in 10th spot with just six laps to go
1384874 then things just turned bad ricky stenhouse jr drove into my left rear while we were racing into turn one at 200 mph it was all i could do to keep it from being more serious than it was the end result was the a casola farms dodge bounced off the wall
1384875 it is upsetting when i drive a clean race and i get stuffed by a stupid move on the part of another competitor i just lose respect for a racer like that
1384876 we tested pretty well at nashville a couple weeks back so i am looking forward to a strong effort
1384877 nothing would make me happier than to qualify well and race well
1384878 i am a little down now a little frustrated disappointed but i will snap out of it and be ready to give it my best effort at nashville
1384879 i am not so sure hes capable of backing off
1384880 i think hes kind of got a mind set which i think is the best way to race for a championship to go after it every week we wouldnt want to have him do anything other than try to win every race
1384881 im not a happy person when im not running well
1384882 i think it is just frustrating to find that such type of cheating planned cheating is still going on
1384883 the dna analysis are 100 percent so if the urine does not belong to the athlete then they certainly have a case to answer its a sad story
1384884 it was a great game for us the last game before going into the olympic tournament we are happy that we played them and im sure they feel they got better from this
1384885 but at the end of the day we won the ball game and found a way to win
1384886 i think we made it a little hard on ourselves by not moving the ball around as much we did not make our outside shots tonight as well as we have done in the past
1384887 youve got eight rounds four each in the 100 and 200 metres and ive got to go in there with my gloves on every round
1384888 that guys fast but i am going to be in the race
1384889 im not a favourite and that doesnt matter im never a favourite in my eyes in training
1384890 i know usain is the world record holder but ive got to look at tyson
1384891 he knows how to run those rounds and has run fast times at the end of those rounds
1384892 some times the fastest guy doesnt win but definitely the strongest always wins
1384893 dude it was all about the trendy bubble hem thats the kind of thing they wear on that show
1384894 no non sei snob lo sembri a volte ma rassegnati sei na carciofara dentro
1384895 s lo porque no oyes el sonido de la m quina de escribir no significa que no est escribiendo
1384896 surely i have figured out how to raise a child by now do i really have to re think this whole business
1384897 i want you to be so much more than just stay at home moms that part is important but you could be so much more than just that
1384898 nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you
1384899 call unto me and i will answer thee and show thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not
1384900 holy spirit i dont know what to do in this situation but i know you know the answer show me what to do
1384901 he wanted to include the arts pretty much from the start and this was all part of his vision
1384902 it was a nice idea to try and make out that everybody wasnt just a muddied oaf
1384903 in the opening ceremonies you have a lot of prescribed music the olympic hymn has to be sung and the national anthem of the host country
1384904 which champion gets the gold medal montserrat caballe again she demonstrates that she possesses one of the most beautiful voices ever to issue from a human throat
1384905 the opening ceremonies are more of ritual and the closing ceremonies are more of a going away party for the athletes you will see more popular music that the athletes can relate to
1384906 we have a familiarity with each other this was absolutely the best preparation we could have going into next week
1384907 i thought our team just fought hard we werent going to be denied
1384908 but it is just rehearsal we feel good about the win but now its 0 0 and we would like to win it when it counts
1384909 im not making any predictions for the olympics im just going to do whatever helps the team
1384910 it just felt like i had a hard day in the training room
1384911 i didnt let it bother me i just blocked it out i just went after it like every other championship

1384921 some of the most intense and perfectly paced survival horror ive had the pleasure of being terrified by
1384922 the highly increased performance values of components from the entry level segment due to constant further developments have made it possible to offer mini pc systems at extremely attractive prices

1384953 my childhood dream was to grow up to be vice president that way i figured id get into history books but i wouldnt have to do any work i am the one person who even after my parents pointed him out on tv aspired to become walter mondale with voters asking for change this might be my year so i called a person who has vetted candidates for past nominees and asked him to vet me because of the sensitive nature of his work he requested that he remain anonymou and that i not give him a stupid name like eddie vetter some people learned a different kind of lesson from watergate

1384967 since opening in november 2005 almost eight million people have visited the georgia aquarium

1384971 the professional game in this country is something that we can all be rightly proud of with fantastic clubs gifted players charismatic managers and passionate crowds
1384972 this success and popularity means that the less appealing aspects of the game are seen and copied further down the football family week in and out
1384973 there is a lot to do and we accept changes in culture dont happen overnight however this is a really important programme for the long term health of the game
1384974 football has a unique ability to connect with people and we in football ultimately have a responsibility to ensure that connection is a truly positive one
1384975 the programme is about equality and respect and its about trying to encourage parents to care about their children and not to be obsessed with success
1384976 were in a sport and there are more important things than winning a football match committed and dedicated as you want the players to be

1384987 dont read this blog unless you understand the need to wipe the slate clean
1384988 people were saying the turning point of the season was in toronto when
1384989 to be completely honest i despise running hate it competing in these insane 100 mile running races all weekend long and all the training that goes with it is utter torture
1384990 that said i continue to do it because i hate spending time with my family a thousand times more than competing in this ridiculous sport
1384991 my strict training method consists of running about 20 to 30 miles a day in preparation for my weekend races that take place twice a month
1384992 i pretend to need total concentration while running so i ask my family not to call me
1384993 do you want to play guitar hero or go kill some ants
1384994 it keeps him happy he sure seems to love it
1384995 like most of the races this one is in the desert about a million degrees i usually puke on average about ten times a day from dehydration and exhaustion but that doesnt deter me not even the hallucinations can stop me its sooooo much better than watching dance recitals and soccer games

1385000 doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills
1385001 have you seen the new commercial the mccain campaign compares barack obama to britney spears and paris hilton
1385002 and today the obama campaign released an ad comparing john mccain to zsa zsa gabor and bea arthur
1385003 senses a chink in obamas armor following the democrats european tour which did not appear to give obama a noticeable bounce in the polls despite drawing a crowd of 200 000 in berlin
1385004 it is a strategy that carries some risks with americans weary of partisan sniping
1385005 beyond this one ad other overriding concerns im hearing is that mccain has perhaps gone too negative and its taking away from his above the fray campaign that he has said that he wants to run
1385006 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
1385007 remarks put mr obamas campaign in a delicate position his campaign gingerly tried to tamp down the issue saying he did not believe that mr mccain had tried to use race as an issue
1385008 was the latest spike in a contest thats grown increasingly negative despite pledges by both obama and mccain to run aboveboard campaigns
1385009 as both maneuver for advantage and polls show the race competitive three months before the election
1385010 the nature of maryland law was such that i had to provide them with a written request for info signed by yrs trly
1385011 complied by e mailing a scan of a signed request letter
1385012 they informed me that the board isnt allowed to e mail such info in response
1385013 i didnt want to wait for the snail mail so i requested they let me know by phone
1385014 i spelled the name and they were well familiar with who i was talking about i cant imagine that there could be many other bruce ivins in frederick maryland
1385015 any response to the request may be made telephonically to the number above or to his email address inasmuch as this is information for a story on deadline there is no need to mail the response
1385016 the purpose of this correspondence is to provide you with a written request
1385017 pursuant to maryland law as you expressed it to me for all public voter registration information for an individual by the name of bruce ivins included but not limited to name address of registration party affiliation and elections primaries in which the registrant has voted
1385018 if you are journalist engaged or desiring to specialize in rural journalism you must quite importantly be able to develop a clear picture of the social economic and political life of the rural sector a proper and comprehensive understanding of the rural sector is crucial for effective and objective reporting
1385019 the hyperpresident is putting the public sector under his direct control
1385020 those who say the promotion of laurence ferrari is proof of the influence of nicolas sarkozy on tf1 were saying not very long ago that patrick poivre darvor was a sell out to the elysee palace

1385029 perfect business model for the site chief executive officer eric schmidt said this month
1385030 if you think about how an operating system is loaded
1385031 its loaded onto a hard disk physically located on that machine
1385032 the operating system is tied very tightly to that hardware
1385033 midori is one of many incubation projects underway at microsoft its simply a matter of being too early in the incubation to talk about it
1385034 the real savings are around physical management of the devices and associated licensing
1385035 within the microsoft environment we have struggled for years with applications that are written so poorly that they will not work with others
1385036 virtualising this gives you a couple of new ways to tackle those traditional problems
1385037 on the desktop we are seeing people place great value in being able to abstract the desktop from actual physical hardware
1385038 people take their application the operating system they want to run it against package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client
1385039 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that
1385040 i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around
1385041 eighty percent of windows sales are made when a new pc is sold
1385042 thats a huge amount of money for them that they do not have to go out and get
1385043 if windows ends up being less important over time as applications become more os agnostic where will microsoft make its money
1385044 this is so stupid a lot of the problem is americans as usual spending more than they have and the dumb banks who let them get away with it i feel sorry for neither
1385045 do you believe in god why youve seen no proof of it you dont have to see proof of a thing to see its results or consequences
1385046 i think the media has to take a lot of blame for all the derogatory remarks written about the economy and this country day in and day out
1385047 please just once in a while write about something pleasant and with good common sense
1385048 as usual you dont have a clue just fan flames it is not bushs bail out its your damn demagogs sic you know the jack asses imploding economy really
1385049 youre hysterical and worse out of focus try saying something new and constructive
1385050 the subprime meltdown is a perfect example of the emperor has no clothes phenomenon these were complex products yet obfuscation was considered acceptable bank chief executives should have asked more questions i suspect they saw the juicy profits and hoped underlings understood the risks investment banking culture has a cult aspect to it if you work on wall street or in the city you toe the party line despite lip service to diversity diversity of thinking is not encouraged this atmosphere of craven conformity breeds at first complacency and then mistakes
1385051 this crime was the action of one man who clearly must have lost the battle with his personal demons
1385052 when i was asked if the shooter would go to hell i replied that he must have been living in his own private hell for years
1385053 all the candidates on our side for various reasons are uninspiring or worse
1385054 we have to keep our word or sources wont trust us
1385055 the networks hyperventilating broadcasts of leaked false allegations purportedly tying the anthrax to saddam husseins iraqi regime was bad enough
1385056 its imperative for abc to tell us what happened here
1385057 big media and the government are already in a kind credibility death spiral this doesnt help
1385058 pressure on abc to out their sources should be swift and sustained
1385059 i join those who believe that some kind of congressional investigation is in order there are too many echoes of niger and uranium

1385069 how could i tell the method that i want to sort the books based on their prices
1385070 im so sorry to say that it would not be possible because the method would choose the appropriate way for sorting on its own

1385082 his departure from australia to play rugby union has caused a lot of ink to flow sold a lot of papers and allowed a lot of australian supporters to release their pent up frustrations by mail but the facts are there sonny bill williams is well and truly a toulon player for the 2008 09 season with an option of one year

1385088 rumor iphone 2 01 update to be released in the next 10 mins
1385089 he is one of the most promising young bowlers in the country and im sure he will continue to be a great asset to our team
1385090 to be able to boast an effective bowling attack made up of local lads which include liam plunkett and mark davies reflects well on the area
1385091 i dont have my car keys in my pocket when i walk out my door
1385092 we make progress not necessarily in big leaps and bounds but i think were making continuous progress and thats the important part
1385093 there are a lot of sections of the city where walking is a very definite option for people
1385094 people enjoy the fact they can walk from one area to another in a safe way
1385095 to be a follower of christ in gaza and to be a disciple for the lord in gaza this could cost you your life
1385096 and the question is how far are you willing to go to follow the steps of the lord are you going to follow him from far away or are you willing to go all the way
1385097 she believed that satan when he killed ramim he tried to kill christ which was in rami
1385098 he tried to kill the testimony of the christian faith and this is why she continues to go forward and continue to serve the lord and continues the ministry and the work which is close to ramis heart
1385099 one of the main things that inspired us is what god called us to do
1385100 but also that we belong to a wonderful body the body of christ that we are part of this wonderful family family of god and to have brothers and sisters who really care and who are really praying for us that means a lot to us
1385101 the reasonable homeschooler has no idea what will be good enough for the osse
1385102 we would have to advise our homeschooling members in d c not to submit this material for such arbitrary approval
1385103 if these two changes are made hslda believes this will be acceptable to homeschoolers
1385104 2 800 e mails and written comments and 400 phone calls
1385105 the participation of the homeschooling community was a very significant component of this process the voice of the community helped to ensure that we approved regulations which are sound and balanced

1385108 i dont want you do work so hard while im away so im cutting you some slack
1385109 i doubt well get rooney fit for the start of the season with the virus hes had
1385110 its a virus he picked up in nigeria and its not a nice one but quite a few have had it
1385111 if martin oneill came to randy and said i need 30million for player x and the player would fit into what we are trying to do randy would have his cheque book out before martin could get past the players name
1385112 additionally he will be equally ready to fund the other players that martin says he needs randy has never said no to martin
1385113 randy is no roman abramovich but he does have a wallet and he will open it martin knows that randy has made it perfectly clear we do not have to sell a player to buy a player
1385114 randy is in it for the long term he wants europe he wants winning football he wants entertainment for the fans
1385115 hell be different to michael because hes a different man michael had his style and that was very successful kevin will bring kevin pietersen which is crucial hell be his own man and thats going to be really important
1385116 whats really promising is that the senior arm of the team is going to get behind him well start on thursday but weve got a lot of cricket coming up to christmas so its an exciting time
1385117 one of the first things i wanted to do when we were going to offer him the captaincy was to sit down with him and talk to him about where he was coming from and what were his views about where he wanted the side to go and whether they matched with mine
1385118 we sat down and talked for a good hour or so and by the end of it we both felt very confident that we were coming from the same place which was exciting so i drove away quite buoyant and excited about what the future might hold
1385119 what i like about kevin is hes got a view thats going to be important in his captaincy hes passionate hes committed about the way he goes about his cricket
1385120 whilst spouses may have the skills experience or qualifications to make them the most appropriate candidate for work in their partners parliamentary or constituency office this is less likely to apply to mps children whether under 18 or young adults
1385121 furthermore recent incidents involving the employment by mps of their children demonstrate clearly the negative impact this has on public confidence in members
1385122 the proposal is therefore that mps children should no longer be able to gain paid employment in their parents constituency or parliamentary offices or in any other role relating to the parents work as an mp
1385123 i would hope that everyone can realize that i dont think we can just take the week off because weve got it made now
1385124 that was a start but it is going to get tougher and tougher down the road we wont enshrine them for having one good game
1385125 they want to distract people from talking about the real issues
1385126 this is a very respectful campaign i dont think our campaign is negative in the slightest
1385127 mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1385128 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1385129 would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
1385130 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1385131 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1385132 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1385133 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1385134 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1385135 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1385136 yeah there were some things like you couldnt have more than three enemies on the screen at once so we had to make sure that thats how it stayed in our game in the part with the dragon with the flame there should be flickering and whatnot
1385137 in the options of this game you can adjust that unlike the old games
1385138 you asked for it you got it or why i need to do more triathlons
1385139 im not going to put my life at risk walking across a big parking lot not knowing exactly where im going
1385140 we understand it can be an inconvenience and we apologize for that
1385141 if youre blind in a wheelchair or elderly youre not going to cross five lanes of traffic and walk a half mile of parking lot
1385142 if you are disabled if you have small children anyone with a traveling problem is excluded because of where they drop off
1385143 weve been working very hard to dissuade them from making that decision
1385144 we were very concerned about our passengers and their safety
1385145 weve been working with pace and the village of lombard to create a clean safe and adequate facility on the property
1385146 until we reach an agreement this is the solution weve come up with
1385147 dont hurt us to enhance your position at the negotiating table
1385148 we want to spend money and patronize the businesses but we cant do it if we cant get on the property
1385149 the matter is closed now he ronaldo is a manchester united player its finished hell be playing here next season believe me its finished
1385150 we believe that this squad is full of quality of plenty of talent its a team which is a great family very close
1385151 we said that the new arrivals would be few but of great quality that seemed logical after two successful seasons in which weve brought in 19 young promising players
1385152 this the low number of signings was a request of the board of directors
1385153 the matter is closed now he ronaldo is a manchester united player its finished hell be playing here next season believe me its finished
1385154 rafael van der vaart is the first and possibly the only signing of the summer for real madrid
1385155 we believe that this squad is full of quality of plenty of talent its a team which is a great family very close
1385156 we said that the new arrivals would be few but of great quality that seemed logical after two successful seasons in which weve brought in 19 young promising players
1385157 this the low number of signings was a request of the board of directors
1385158 ronaldo is a fantastic player one of the best in the world
1385159 when england changed captains it did suggest to me that they might be vulnerable but you should always beware the wounded lion
1385160 we are expecting a huge backlash from england they have new leadership a new direction they are all going to want to impress kp so we are expecting a really tough challenge
1385161 kp is going to bring a lot to the job he has had challenges thrown at him all along the way and he has always seemed to come out doing really well he seems to thrive on it
1385162 it will be a huge challenge to him does it affect his batting what is his vision going to be
1385163 there is no feeling among us that pietersen is still one of ours
1385164 he made his decision it has clearly been a good move for him and he is regarded as the enemy now we cant claim him
1385165 i dont know what reaction there has been in south africa but i am pretty sure there will be some proud people there people who have probably had an influence in kps career somewhere down the line
1385166 we had probably the best atmosphere i have ever experienced in the dressing room on saturday night in birmingham
1385167 it was amazing but today we have had a chat about getting our feet back on the ground there is one more test to play and we will take this one very seriously indeed
1385168 we are a very goal driven side and we want to become very ruthless we want to be a resilient team and this is part of the journey
1385169 for us there is no dead rubber no dead test match it is about playing to the best of our ability come thursday
1385170 we have been able to tick one box but we are looking to improve on our performances all the time to become the complete package which i dont think we are yet
1385171 obama is a tad cooler than mccain on probably 57 fronts
1385172 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1385173 mccain that guys not cool i just cant call mccain cool
1385174 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1385175 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go
1385176 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength
1385177 look at hugh hefner hell be cool til the day he dies but for him and for ron paul or anybody whos elderly and whos cool part of it is what they represent that makes them that
1385178 the most important thing in terms of reaching youth is not being cool its being authentic or true to who you are
1385179 i think hed look ridiculous if he tried to purposefully seem younger than he is if he started doing extreme sports or something ridiculous
1385180 has a very conservative image and that doesnt really help him either
1385181 shes not the type like obamas wife who can get down and dirty with younger people and really relate to them
1385182 its not a popularity contest hes running for leader of the free world
1385183 the driver is dependent on the following vis that are not part of the driver or in vi lib
1385184 the driver is dependent on the following vis that are not part of the driver or in vi lib
1385185 could not find adequate proof that early detection leads to fewer men dying of the disease
1385186 they tried very hard to convict him up here they spared no resources and it didnt work
1385187 its tragic for him and his family to have to continually go through this its almost laughable
1385188 it could be samits final championship game of the season for us and its an important game for him to continue his run of form and catch the eye
1385189 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part
1385190 i think quite a few of the tennis players are staying in hotels but i dont understand why you would want to
1385191 if you make the decision to play in the olympics why would you want to stay anywhere else
1385192 its a great experience to spend time with the greatest athletes in the world and im sure that i will speak to some of them
1385193 i heard that the village is awesome im looking forward it
1385194 everyone that goes to the olympics dreams of bringing home a medal of some sort
1385195 gold would obviously be best but to get on the podium would be great regardless its a few matches away yet and like everyone has said the conditions are very tough
1385196 the majority of the top players are going to be there so its going to be a very strong field
1385197 i think when it comes to olympics a lot of the best teams in the world get split up
1385198 me and jamie have played a lot together i guess behind the seeded teams we will be dark horses but theres no reason why we cant get close to winning a medal
1385199 two defeats is not the way i envisaged coming back with england i didnt wait 18 months to get beaten
1385200 it wasnt ideal but in a perverse way the first one at headingley i enjoyed in the sense of being back around the lads playing in front of a big crowd and playing for england
1385201 i just wish the outcome had been slightly different because for six months ive had to work so hard to get back in the side i am enjoying being there
1385202 ive had a start ive bowled some overs and ive batted okay but now i need to start performing properly
1385203 before this ankle operation i thought if i didnt think i could recapture the form of previously i wouldnt have put myself up for all of this
1385204 i feel i can do that i feel i am getting there but i can rattle on as much as i can about it ive got to start doing it out on the field
1385205 people go on about the ashes next year weve got thursday to concentrate on weve got beaten twice by south africa and weve got to pull it around a bit
1385206 it is not a dead rubber maybe it is in the context of the series but we are playing for england and we are certainly playing for pride it is not measured by a trophy or a cheque there is a lot for us to play for as cricketers
1385207 for a start weve got to score more runs in the first innings of a test match than we have in the last two to give ourselves a decent chance
1385208 randy has told martin to get the players he wants and not worry about the money we all know we need more players we trust martin to know what the squad needs and to go and get the players
1385209 if martin oneill came to randy and said i need 30million for player x and the player would fit into what we are trying to do randy would have his cheque book out before martin could get past the players name
1385210 additionally he will be equally ready to fund the other players that martin says he needs randy has never said no to martin
1385211 randy is no roman abramovich but he does have a wallet and he will open it martin knows that randy has made it perfectly clear we do not have to sell a player to buy a player
1385212 randy is in it for the long term he wants europe he wants winning football he wants entertainment for the fans
1385213 this is more than a business to him villa is a passion
1385214 ive had two good seasons but youve got to keep challenging yourself as a player to keep progressing and hopefully this season i can push on again
1385215 playing in europe is a big boost to everyone at villa but it also means you are playing against different systems and players which presents a challenge in itself
1385216 you play against quality players in the premier league but europe will be different again
1385217 if i can play a bit in europe this season hopefully it will help me stay in the england squad and that i can win the first cap ashley young has had his first caps and i would love the same if i can impress the coach
1385218 i think european football will be that next step were ready to make that step as a team the players who have tasted europe before want to taste it again and the rest of us want it for the first time
1385219 hell be different to michael because hes a different man
1385220 kevin will bring kevin pietersen which is crucial hell be his own man and thats going to be really important
1385221 whats really promising is that the senior arm of the team is going to get behind him
1385222 well start on thursday but weve got a lot of cricket coming up to christmas so its an exciting time
1385223 one of the first things i wanted to do when we were going to offer him the captaincy was to sit down with him and talk to him about where he was coming from and what were his views about where he wanted the side to go and whether they matched with mine
1385224 we sat down and talked for a good hour or so and by the end of it we both felt very confident that we were coming from the same place which was exciting so i drove away quite buoyant and excited about what the future might hold
1385225 what i like about kevin is hes got a view thats going to be important in his captaincy hes passionate hes committed about the way he goes about his cricket

1385283 real ale is a natural living product so there is a much greater intensity of flavours
1385284 one of our objectives is to get people to try it there are fruit beers wheat beers porters stouts milds and golden ales its incredibly diverse so theres something to meet everyones tastes
1385285 pasteurising and filtering a beer kills off a lot of the natural flavours
1385286 a processed keg beer is completely inert a dead flat liquid drawn up to bar with carbon dioxide to put some life in it thats why theyre so fizzy compared to a real ale
1385287 for eight months a year were a family at times things happen flare up but its between the family its in the family
1385288 its a little bit rude when your neighbors are fighting next door for you to go knock on the door and ask what happened we handle it ourselves its between us and its nobodys business but it wasnt that big a deal
1385289 just because its on tv doesnt make it anybodys right to know what happened its between us
1385290 if you want to know what happened what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know its private its between us and its not a big deal its not the first time it happened and it wont be the last
1385291 its what happens it makes teams better its not a problem its nobodys business

1385306 i heard on the radio today that the soul put an end to the philly curse
1385307 im sorry that i caused so much embarrassment for my family the school and the football program
1385308 im thankful for the opportunity to be out here it was very difficult being away from the school and the football team that i care so much about im blessed to have this chance
1385309 were still evaluating him i have a long history of giving guys opportunities a lot of thought went into it though
1385310 the guys that we do have i know theyre going to work hard and compete
1385311 we have a couple of freshmen that came in that are pretty good and weve got a couple of guys that were already here that know safety and are doing pretty good
1385312 i agree with half of what you say but i disagree with the other half because it contradicts the first half
1385313 we have drastically changed the bodies of some of the guys joe thomas and c j davis have both lost more than 30 pounds
1385314 i love the way our football team looks were a lean and very athletic group right now what we were shooting for
1385315 offensive line coach tony wise had an interesting observation he comes here from coaching with the jets against all those all pros and were going through spring practice and the best players in our conference that we have to block not that the steelers have to block have all been guys who are athletes that can run
1385316 we took this another step and said weve got to be able to match up with these guys a 6 foot 5 guy that is an athlete who can move and is 320 there arent many like that so what can we do how can we match up against them counter that thats how we started the ball rolling
1385317 our middle guys are very solid and we have a lot of talent at tackle but we have to work out our starters there

1385337 the inspector general and the legislative branch is set up to be independent so there need not be prior notice of an investigation nor approval before speaking to the media

1385339 the oig by ordinance is expressly authorized to initiate any investigation audit or review without prior notification the council purposely structured the oig in this way to shield it from political pressure of any kind

1385361 a long time ago i received a commission from the organization of american states to write a chamber opera
1385362 when i discussed this with my brother rub n he suggested that we look at el alarma a tabloid magazine that claims to print only the truth as a point of departure for ideas about popular stories in the news media that had a particular social impact we found a striking piece of news and visual images about a man who committed suicide because of a woman camelia la tejana from that story we started to conceive the entire opera
1385363 i have grown up 10 minutes from the ground i know what it means to the people of birmingham
1385364 its very much a passionate club the fans are about the blues
1385365 i think a many of them arent happy that a club of this size is in the championship it belongs in the premier league
1385366 it belongs in the top half of the premier league
1385367 one of the things me and the manager spoke about when we sat down to sign was that i want to win the championship i want to win some medals i want to get promoted and stabilise the club in the premier league thats what i am thinking about
1385368 they have had two good years and you have to stand back and take your hat off to them but we know we were good last year and we have another level to go to
1385369 last year i think we saw the very best of man united but we have got an awful lot to come from last year
1385370 we have got improvements to make but i think man united are at their peak
1385371 the young players were fantastic and young rafael the right back was a sensation for me
1385372 i thought it was a real eye opener for us he hadnt played for a year but hes played a full 90 minutes today his brother fabio has played 45 minutes and hes also done well so were really pleased by their contribution
1385373 you know what footballs like sometimes it turns up some star some little nugget maybe on the evidence of tonight i think we have got a good player here
1385374 hopefully there will be two or three players coming on board before the transfer window closes
1385375 at the end of last season i thought we needed another top striker at the club and ive not changed that view because youve got to put the ball in the back of the net
1385376 i will be showing ivan around the training ground and portman road
1385377 he has played at the highest level for many years and is someone i feel could do a good job for us
1385378 hes got bags of experience and could come into the club and really help our younger players but we havent got that far down the line yet
1385379 we will sit down and have a chat and if there is something that we can sort out then great if not we move on
1385380 ive come back and ive not really had much thought about it to be honest
1385381 ive had speculation in every transfer window when i was at everton and i have learned to deal with it
1385382 unless there is something i need to say yes or no to then i dont really need to speak about anything at the minute
1385383 im here im fighting for the cause and i think the fans can see that i am here so that should be enough
1385384 this is the first ive heard that hes going to be a done and dusted liverpool player by friday
1385385 the final program schedule available at www ar2008 org includes
1385386 animal rights 2008 is the animal rights movements annual national conference it is a forum for sharing knowledge reporting on progress discussing strategies and tactics networking and recharging our batteries all viewpoints that support the goal of animal liberation from all forms of human oppression are welcome
1385387 unless theres a change in diet were not going to solve the global warming problem
1385388 single largest source of emissions of methane and nitrous oxide
1385389 a sacred duty applying jewish values to help heal the world
1385390 not only do i not object to the establishment of the commission to examine the states failure in the supply of desalinated water
1385391 i insist that the commission should be established and explain to everyone how a coterie of ministry of finance officials however talented they may be are capable of bringing misery to an entire nation
1385392 changes in our environment and the resulting upheavals from droughts to inundated coastal areas to loss of arable land are likely to become a major driver of war and conflict
1385393 the tide of history is moving toward the protection of animal rights someday vegetarianism may even be the norm
1385394 we know the israeli publiche moment theyll have to pay for the bag either theyll take just one or they wont take any at all
1385395 the polluter pays law effectively tackles the basic problem of environmental hazards up until now economic interests in israel made it worthwhile financially to pollute the environment the new law now makes environmental pollution economically disadvantageous
1385396 by attacking the pocketbooks of polluting companies we can arrive at a situation where our earth water and air will be cleaner
1385397 i wholeheartedly endorse the campaign of hsus it is a basic value of our jewish religion and tradition to refrain from tzaar baalei chaim or to refrain from inflicting pain and suffering on any living creature amen our faith requires us to follow the ways of the lord and as we read in psalms 145 9 the lord is good to all and his compassion extends to all his works
1385398 this has cost us more than 25 million since 1995 when the sinkholes started opening up
1385399 tourists from abroad dont know exactly where the sea is located and where the sinkholes are so they dont come as much anymore
1385400 also i think there is antagonism that we are allowing such a valuable site as the dead sea to be destroyed
1385401 a decision like this cannot be made without checking the ecological impact on the environment
1385402 its possible that with a canal the sea will turn brown or red its possible it will stink because of the introduction of new chemical and biological substances into the water
1385403 our global climate policy is based on negotiating the next phase of the unfccc in good faith
1385404 climate change will affect low income households disproportionately in shaping our responses we must ensure that low income households are able to benefit from new opportunities and are shielded from price hikes for essential goods and services we must ensure that low income households are a real part of our solution to this serious issue
1385405 landlords will repay the energy efficiency investment at a similar rate to owner occupiers but directly to the scheme administrator as the details of the repayments will be publicly available landlords will be in a position to transparently pass on this cost as a rent increase for the duration of the repayment period
1385406 it is vital that those people facing high costs most particularly australias poorest people are compensated for these rising prices however it is also vital this compensation boosts rather than undermines the point of the scheme cash handouts tax cuts welfare cheques or free permits will reduce the effectiveness of the scheme will be inflationary and will be temporary relief from a permanent price hike
1385407 they told me at the blood bank this might happen
1385408 this is just a 15 minute power nap as recommended in that time management course you sent me to
1385409 whew guess i left the top off the white out you probably got here just in time
1385410 i wasnt sleeping i was meditating on the mission statement and envisioning a new paradigm

1385419 it is time for me to step down and choose the next emperor i have decided to choose one of you
1385420 i am going to give each one of you a seed today one very special seed i want you to plant the seed water it and come back here after one year from today with what you have grown from this one seed i will then judge the plants that you bring and the one i choose will be the next emperor
1385421 today one of you will be appointed the next emperor
1385422 the emperor knows im a failure maybe he will have me killed
1385423 one year ago today i gave everyone here a seed i told you to take the seed plant it water it and bring it back to me today but i gave you all boiled seeds which would not grow all of you except ling have brought me trees and plants and flowers when you found that the seed would not grow you substituted another seed for the one i gave you ling was the only one with the courage and honesty to bring me a pot with my seed in it therefore he is the one who will be the new emperor
1385424 hi handsome my name is rose im eighty seven years old can i give you a hug
1385425 why are you in college at such a young innocent age
1385426 im here to meet a rich husband get married have a couple of children and then retire and travel
1385427 i always dreamed of having a college education and now im getting one
1385428 im sorry im so jittery i gave up beer for lent and this whiskey is killing me ill never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what i know
1385429 we do not stop playing because we are old we grow old because we stop playing
1385430 you have to laugh and find humor every day youve got to have a dream when you lose your dreams you die we have so many people walking around who are dean and dont even know it
1385431 there is a huge difference between growing older and growing up if you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and dont do one productive thing you will turn twenty years old if i am eighty seven years old and stay in bed for a year and never do anything i will turn eighty eight anybody can grow older that doesnt take any talent or ability the idea is to grow up by always finding the opportunity in change
1385432 have no regrets the elderly usually dont have regrets for what we did but rather for things we did not do the only people who fear death are those with regrets

1385439 i think there is a parallel between san jose and detroit
1385440 it took the red wings three years of playoff experience to finally win the stanley cup as a team we had gained experience from losing to edmonton in 2006 and anaheim in 2007
1385441 i think there are three types of teams in the nhl
1385442 there are teams building for the playoffs teams expecting to make the playoffs and teams expecting to win the stanley cup san jose is like detroit in the latter group
1385443 the fans ownership management and players expect to win the sharks have had several successful regular seasons but not in the playoffs the pressure to win here will be similar to that in detroit where the pressure to win every year is immense
1385444 whether a player has one goal or 600 goals players want to score we talk offense even in our own defensive zone but thinking offensively doesnt mean you are not responsible for other areas away from the puck
1385445 to get over the top we have to deal with pressure in the playoffs
1385446 i think the team has dealt with that this summer we have brought in rob blake they have all won stanley cups
1385447 en el patio caen las pinzas de la ropa de alg n dios
1385448 the olympics gives us a chance to show the world who we are not just about the modern china you see but also the spirit and culture of china
1385449 i just dont think its fair to criticize us all the time this is a sporting event and politics should be kept out of it
1385450 why focus only on the things we do bad thats not right
1385451 i hope people will come and visit us so that we can better understand each other
1385452 change does not happen overnight it takes time but you have to appreciate the great strides we have made in the last 30 years to be a more open society
1385453 we are a rising nation thats increasingly playing an important role on the global stage and we are proud of that
1385454 a few negative events are not going to stop us we will learn from these disasters and be stronger for it
1385455 there werent any lives he touched that werent made better by his influence
1385456 he was such a people person and he grew up in the public spotlight
1385457 hed come up and introduce himself to someone hed never met hi im john mark stallings
1385458 if i could go back and the good lord would give me an option and hed say i could give you a perfectly normal healthy boy or im gonna give you johnny id take johnny every time
1385459 im trying to be a big kid and put that stuff behind me
1385460 hopefully they still feel like they made a mistake and if not ill just try to prove my case again this year that they should put me on the team
1385461 drayson has certainly has gotten comfortable in the role he plays out in spokane and is gifted in scoring goals and creating offense
1385462 im not surprised by it ive watched him develop over the past four years hes certainly very gifted
1385463 he had that ability a couple of years ago but it was just a matter of gaining his confidence where he was at and the level that he was playing at
1385464 hopefully they still feel like they made a mistake and if not ill just try to prove my case again this year that they should put me on the team
1385465 i certainly feel i can play with the best players in my age group and even excel there are some good players at lake placid they are all from different leagues and stuff so it is kind of hard to compare from that standpoint i certainly feel i can compete and play very well against them
1385466 im excited you always want to see how you stack up against the best or the guys that you hear are the best in your age group i would kind of compare it to the canadian hockey league top prospects game you know where you take all the best guys from the three leagues and you get to see them all in games and practice situations that was real good for me to see at the prospects game and i expect the same here

1385473 i doubt well get rooney fit for the start of the season with this virus he has had its a bad virus he has not been training
1385474 the matter is closed now he is a manchester united player it is finished he is going to be a player here next season believe me
1385475 the first and almost certainly the last signing we will make this season
1385476 who am i to tell you how to think about something as important as the war in iraq
1385477 but if i can shed some light on it having gone and embedded and done 25 30 missions and give people some insight on what american families face by providing a window in to their lives thats what i can do
1385478 with the films that are made by hollywood it seems there are a lot of agendas people are trying to push
1385479 one of the big truths out there is that a lot of people dont know that what we are doing is working i mean we actually are winning and we do have the support of the populace out there
1385480 i know what makes it on the news usually is the bombs and the explosions and the body count and how many american soldiers have lost their lives there are a lot of great news stories over there and jakes movie does show some of that
1385481 if we didnt have a good military believe me darkness would descend so you have to have a good military whether you believe in the war were fighting or not the military is very important
1385482 the reason were here is to honor our men and women in uniform
1385483 without them you wouldnt have that camera on your shoulder and that microphone
1385484 youd have a government official over your shoulder telling you what to do and what to say we dont have that here in america and its only because of the gis
1385485 in a time of war when we have troops deployed and were focused on our veterans and their care and the care of the wounded and the care of the families deployed in harms way anything thats going to draw attention to our service members and their honorable services is a very very positive thing and thats what the gi film festival was born to do
1385486 i personally havent gone to see any of them because i dont want to see it portrayed in that way because i know thats not how it really is
1385487 i havent even seen any in the last year or two because theyve all been negative
1385488 and ive got over three and a half years of my life over there and im not going to go see something negative about what ive spent a lot of time and lost a lot of friends for
1385489 no its not a fair portrayal at all even in the media in the newspaper
1385490 its not so long ago there was a small tiny little article buried in the paper somewhere about a gi who threw himself on a grenade and was a recipient of the purple heart and on the front page there was something about paris hilton
1385491 i think the films especially the documentary films that capture what our young men and women are doing in a very demanding environment in afghanistan and iraq make a very important contribution
1385492 they all know that this war can be won and they want to get the politics out of it and they say the generals know what theyre doing just let us do our work this is what theyre saying
1385493 some of the movies that have come out have taken stories that have actually happened and who knows if they were accurate or not
1385494 i dont know i havent seen a lot of those movies what the gi film festival is trying to do is celebrate the heroism bravery and courage of the american spirit and the american soldier and thats a very positive thing
1385495 ive been around enough to know its very difficult to say what the audiences want
1385496 the movies that tend to get made are the ones people respond nobody wants to be in the business to make a bunch of movies that arent going to be seen by anyone there have been some movies on the military that havent done well if they had done well then theyd probably make more because it means the audience is hungry for that kind of thing
1385497 with regards to these movies that maybe havent worked its a painful time in our nation
1385498 our nation is at war weve lost service members weve had a lot of wounded come back weve made mistakes we continue to deploy our troops it continues to look like something thats going to last awhile so its a painful time and maybe our nation isnt ready to look at that a lot right now
1385499 certainly you know some of the things that have come out have not been you know have not taken off its hard for me to guess why they didnt work or whatever and im not going to criticize or comment on something i havent seen
1385500 but i do know theres a lot of families that are out there that are hurting and whatever i can do as an american citizen to go out and support our troops and support their families and try to help them out and as a person who has benefited by the sacrifices of our service members over the years and the sacrifices of my grandfather and my uncle and the folks that have fought the nazis and have liberated france and germany i benefited from that
1385501 it hurts when you are told that you cannot stay in hotel because you belong to pakistan now that media has raised this issue i hope people understand this and we are not treated like this anymore
1385502 if pakistans singers actors and cricketers can come and stay here freely why not tennis players
1385503 if you had told me that i was related to george ii i would have thought you were absolutely crackers not even granny butter could have come up with that one
1385504 i would have been terribly proud just to have been related to the german king but i cant hide it from you that even in our common european home i am particularly thrilled to have some british royal ancestry as well
1385505 several thousand other people out there in the same position
1385506 after chinas olympics organizers gave him the assignment folk artist han meilin initially sketched out five children representing the traditional chinese elements of fire wood water gold and earth
1385507 there had to be a panda even though youd think the public would have had enough of them
1385508 any pump price above 1 per litre causes hardship and misery for many millions of car dependent motorists
1385509 already 55 of aa members have cut back on journeys due to prices at the pumps and others are sticking to speed limits and eco driving to make their expensive fuel go further
1385510 we continue to review prices daily and we reduced petrol by up to 3p and diesel by up to 4p at the end of last week to ensure we provide customers with the best possible value for their fuel on a local basis
1385511 it is unacceptable for us to see hear and know what is going on in our animal labs without taking action for all of those affected you have the ucla primate vivisection program to blame
1385512 i obviously have very good links with real madrid but also with ac milan juventus and other top clubs a lot of the time in england people just go for the same players you often have five or six managers watching the same player its a very closed country what we will try to do is open out eyes and work with the likes of real madrid ac milan and juventus we arent looking only in the uk
1385513 nights when you would wake up screaming you see the wreck over and over again
1385514 i still have them a little bit but theyre under control pretty much now
1385515 the first thing about rolando is that he plays very very very intelligent
1385516 i mean in an extreme way both across campus in a classroom its reflected in how he goes about that and also on the football field he just understands the game almost from a coachs eyes then you put on top of that he has an unbelievable amount of ability and hes big and strong so that can be a lethal combination
1385517 its been a lot better going to practice knowing most of the defense theres less stress the learning process is the hardest part to me
1385518 ive been riding four wheelers and dirt bikes all my life
1385519 it was the same as a dirt bike to me just a little bigger and a little faster
1385520 im 18 years old you feel like youre cooped up in college and at school i just wanted to go home and do something different so i got the bike
1385521 yeah ill ride a bike again i just respect a motorcycle more now
1385522 theres not much you can say to a guy who was beat up like i was beat up
1385523 my mom wouldnt say that im lucky she says that im blessed that god was watching over me
1385524 last year we just didnt have enough depth to overcome it when we hit a bump in the road
1385525 but now we have a group of really good young players how they develop is going to go a long way into saying what kind of football team we can be

1385547 tasers have contributed to resolving incidents without injury where otherwise there would have been a real possibility of someone being seriously injured or killed
1385548 in a significant proportion of cases they have not needed to be fired drawing or aiming the taser has been enough of a deterrent
1385549 while the deployment of tasers is and should be an operational matter for the police these figures highlight the increasingly violent situations our police are facing every day
1385550 it also reinforces the need to properly monitor the use of this relatively new technology as it is more widely used
1385551 but arming more officers with dangerous weapons without the rigorous training and necessary safeguards could well be a recipe for disaster

1385634 lord jesus has saved me from sin and death and lord has chosen me for his ministry i believe i have faithfully and truthfully done it according the word of god by the guidance of the holy spirit whenever our lord thinks my service is enough in this world he has to call me back at any time to be with him i am always ready for it
1385635 i never earned or gain anything worldly for my wife and children from the ministry i hand over the ministry and all of its assests programmes and activities to the governing board in which my wife or children are not the members
1385636 our lord weighs our minds and hearts he knows all of us very well do not misuse his physical and economical gifts for worldly pleasures like the sons of the prophet samuel do not misuse his spiritual gifts like balaam yet we may be reviled persecuted and experienced all manner of evil against us falsely certainly it strengthen our spirituality when it comes from gentiles and outcasters but it is very difficult to tolerate if it comes from our dear brotheren of whom we love and trust in the name of jesus they may be called as missionaries pastors and evangelists such experiences from them will make us desperate depress and discourage it affect both our body and spirit
1385637 this so called christians may have power of money power of the support of foreign agencies and power of human strength which they might have bought from money or throwing them some favours and small positions but they may not belong to god those are false currencies or coins they not know what they do the word of god teaches that they are the enemies of the cross of christ whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things
1385638 but we must careful that there are true and valuable currencies it is indeed necessary for any transactions thats why false currencies are spreading widely but realise the false currencies have no value and it is to be destructed also handling the false currencies is a big crime so distinguish the good and evil spirits our lord allows the tares with the wheat together until the harvest so recognise them by their fruits dont be cheated our lord is the burning fire too
1385639 the harvest is plentiful but the labourers are few so our lord asked to pray to the owner of the harvest for sending suitable labourers in certain places there were such a vast and beautiful harvest to reap but unsuitable labourers got down the field and reaped some of it for their own use not for the lord and destructed the rest of the harvest and soil became hard by their feet and made the fields desert even no more cultivation is possible then how can we reap india is a best example for it 60 of the land of the kingdom of israel is desert it is not too far those desert lands can be formed as gardens it can be possible by culturing the sea water and make it flow to the desert lands the bride church of our lord is called as the israel of the new covenent certainly still there are plenty of harvest to reap but not full of harvest harvest must be reaped but at the same time 60 of the new covenant israel also keep going on desert land we have to sow the seed before sowing the seed the land must be plouged and watered water must be coming from the sea as cultured useful drinking water sea water is salty and it is the synonym of sin the religions of muslims hindus budhists communists nominal christians etc around us are great oceans by our deep faith and prayer we can culture the salty oceanic water which is sins of this world by the precious blood of jesus and make it flow to the desert minded hearts and plough it by our loving deeds and dedicated services by the holy spirit and sow the seed of the word of god the kingdom of god is not barren there is no desert there is no sea it is the tabernacle of god with his bride and he will be dwelling among us for that we have to serve the lord he is not a godly labourer if a person comes for harvest without thinking of how such a desert land makes plenty of harvest so sow with tears and reap with cheers

1385736 i knew that i was seen as a villain by the republican party the ruling power in the county but i felt that i should have been seen as a hero by my own party especially since my law partner of 10 years had been the new york state democratic chairman and was the senior county chairman in the state of new york

1385774 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it

1385786 congratulations to marty and all of his family it was more than a long time coming and more than justified but it is sad that this was only half a victory too bad that the attorney generals office didnt have the guts or the inclination to finish the story unfortunately i have seen this happen before theyd been handed the true perpetrators on a silver platter through great investigative work by martys team and for reasons known only to them chose not to proceed any further against those who conspired to cause seymour and arlene tankleff their untimely deaths

1385795 estrogen is very interesting besides its actions as a sex hormone it plays many roles in the brain
1385796 we are going to be seeing more of this approach spurred on by the kulkarni studies and other papers
1385797 patients and families should not be rushing to their psychiatrists and asking for estrogen patches
1385798 but they should watch the news coming out of this work carefully
1385799 there is a lot to be done but i believe that we have opened up a new and promising area of treatment for a debilitating illness in both women and men

1385834 the decision to breach the treaty has effectively been made by the district attorney of harris county texas who with the approval of a state trial court judge set an execution date at the earliest point allowed under texas law

1385844 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at fishs effect on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people
1385845 while eating tuna and other types of fish seems to help protect against memory loss and stroke these results were not found in people who regularly ate fried fish
1385846 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role

1385858 im sure lewis wasnt happy about being pipped at the start in hungary and i think there was a point when he thought hang on this is now looking a little bit worrying because on qualifying pace he should have been able to hound the ferrari but he couldnt get close
1385859 you start to get worried when things are not going according to plan and then of course he got the puncture
1385860 he said before the race im not counting any chickens and getting ahead of myself but im absolutely certain he thought it was in the bag
1385861 were getting to ferrari territory at the races from now on
1385862 if you had asked me before the race in hungary who i would put money on i would have said lewis but i have to say i would want my bet back now
1385863 ferrari look strong and so as an outside bet i would put my money on raikkonen

1385949 wir wollen als hilfe und unterst tzung im kosovo t tig sein und nicht als besatzungsmacht das w re ein v llig falscher ansatz
1385950 unsere soldaten m ssen ber das land selbst die konflikte die es dort gibt und auch ber die menschen die bev lkerungsgruppen und die kultur bescheid wissen nur durch gute vorbereitung kann man missverst ndnissen und konflikten ausweichen

1385956 astrology is one of the most ancient sciences held in high esteem of old by the wise and great formerly no prince would make war or peace nor any general fight a battle in short no important affair was undertaken without first consulting an astrologer
1385957 the cosmos is a vast living body of which we are still parts the sun is a great heart whose tremors run through our smallest veins the moon is a great nerve center from which we quiver forever who knows the power that saturn has over us or venus but it is a vital power rippling exquisitely through us all the time
1385958 a most unfailing experience of the excitement of sublunary that is human natures by the conjunctions and aspects of the planets has instructed and compelled my unwilling belief
1385959 that we can now think of no mechanism for astrology is relevant but unconvincing no mechanism was known for example for continental drift when it was proposed by wegener nevertheless we see that wegener was right and those who objected on the grounds of unavailable mechanism were wrong

1386393 ive never made a racist comment and i never attacked obama personally
1386394 a well designed mechanism can impose a fee on a small share of these windfall profits without affecting incentives for oil companies and without affecting the price of oil barack obama will require oil companies to take a reasonable share of their record breaking windfall profits and use it to provide direct relief worth 500 for an individual and 1 000 for a married couple
1386395 the truth is that mccains campaign has received 1 33 million from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry not 2 million

1386433 during july the number of americans who consider themselves to be democrats fell two percentage points to 39
1386434 while barack obama has been newsstand gold for some publications people magazine isnt one of them as its obama and family cover turned out to sell at slightly below its usual newsstand average
1386435 people normally sells 1 45 million copies a week on newsstands the latest estimates put the sales figure for last weeks obama cover at 1 4 million it is believed to be one of the first covers featuring obama that has not sold above normal when time had obama on the cover in 2006 it was the second best selling cover of the year

1386444 can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks
1386445 backed away from rival john mccains challenge for a series of joint appearances agreeing only to the standard three debates in the fall
1386446 due to the late date of the two parties nominating conventions and the relatively short period between the end of the conventions and the first proposed debate it is likely that the four commission debates will be the sole series of debates in the fall campaign
1386447 this is the same thing that was done four years ago or eight years ago
1386448 you guys are all familiar with this we have seen this movie before
1386449 as barack obama has said many many times in the past rap lyrics today too often perpetuate misogyny materialism and degrading images that he doesnt want his daughters or any children exposed to
1386450 how dare you try to disrupt our political system with your disfunctional family
1386451 you may not have to wait until 2012 obama is imploding so fast that by convention time dems will be running to hillary screaming save us save us i have already written senator nelson i live in florida a hillary supporter to make sure her name is put in nomination above all this is where our efforts now ought to be getting commitments from the dnc and super delegates that her name be placed in nomination if that i happens i believe she will win i spent many years in ny politics and i know many of the players at this point they are looking for a way out we have to keep the heat on to give them room to maneuver
1386452 if i were a right wing blogger and i found out that barack obama was wearing ferragamo loafers that cost 520 i would spend about 50 of my waking hours making sure everyone knew this
1386453 what the mccain campaign doesnt want people to know according to one gop strategist i spoke with over the weekend is that they had an ad script ready to go if obama had visited the wounded troops saying that obama was wait for it using wounded troops as campaign props so no matter which way obama turned mccain had an obama bashing ad ready to launch i guess thats political hardball but another word for it is the one word that most politicians are loathe to use about their opponents a lie
1386454 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1386455 we dont mind john mccain going after us if he sticks to the facts
1386456 but we are sick of the distortions about our record
1386457 never before in an election cycle has so much attention turned to the youth vote and luke will bring a unique perspective to covering it
1386458 i am extremely humbled and grateful that nbc news is giving me this opportunity i believe youth issues will continue to play a significant role during this election and i want to do my part to report them honestly and objectively
1386459 i knew that i needed to act as both the grenade thrower and the bomb deflector if we were going to get from here to there
1386460 this is the moment that the world is waiting for
1386461 i had a productive and wide ranging discussion i look forward to working with the democratically elected government of pakistan
1386462 i look forward to collaborating with everybody here to win the election
1386463 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment
1386464 we must revitalize our military to foster peace obama claimed echoing orwell by adding 65 000 soldiers to the army and 27 000 to the marines
1386465 nobody said this to me directly but i get the feeling from my talks that if the sanctions dont work israel is going to strike iran
1386466 if the iranians dont accept a deal now because they think theyre going to get a better deal from the next president theyre mistaken
1386467 has told top u s officials that israel wont rule out a military strike against iran
1386468 the african american reputation as the most consistently progressive ethnic group in the united states will stand or fall according to how blacks comport themselves politically under a barack obama administration
1386469 i note with interest today john mccains new tactic of associating barack obama with oversexed and or promiscuous young white women
1386470 presumably a la harold ford 2006 this will be one of those strategies that will be a matter of deep dispute during the campaign and later treated as transparent and obvious once the campaign is concluded
1386471 the mccain campaign is now pushing the caricature of obama as a uppity young black man whose presumptuousness is displayed not only in taking on airs above his station but also in a taste for young white women
1386472 john mccain right now hes spending an awful lot of time talking about me
1386473 w hat theyre saying is well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama
1386474 scarborough is the media turning against him is the media going to start seizing on things like this to prove that theyre not in the tank for barack obama
1386475 halperin theres been a little bit of the paradigm shift i think that mccain web video might have had the same effect as the saturday night live parody that on the clinton obama race
1386476 mr obamas advisers say that a central message of his campaign that he would represent a break from the way politics are conducted in washington would be tarnished by the simple act of linking himself to the family that has dominated democratic politics since bill clinton won the presidency in 1992
1386477 i think its time for a revival of dope jokes
1386478 as we all know the bush administration essentially brushed aside all notion of due process it locked up and tortured people it said were enemy combatants it engaged in warrantless wiretapping and so on we werent supposed to worry our pretty little heads about this because we were supposed to take it as a given that these were people we could trust not to abuse their power meanwhile the justice department was interviewing job candidates and asking what is it about george w bush that makes you want to serve him in other words there was a combination of power without oversight and a deeply creepy cult of personality i think we were lucky to get out of this with democracy more or less intact
1386479 that is not something i think would be fruitful to pursue because i think that impeachment is something that should be reserved for exceptional circumstances
1386480 hillary hated on you so that b is irrelevant jesse talking slick and apologizing for what
1386481 this song is not only outrageously offensive to sen clinton reverend jackson senator mccain and president bush
1386482 it is offensive to all of us who are trying to raise our children with the values we hold dear while ludacris is a talented individual he should be ashamed of these lyrics
1386483 at obama victory event campaign played 99 problems but a bitch aint one
1386484 i have nothing against obama i just think john mccain has more experience
1386485 the onus of having a post racial attitude is always placed on the oppressed
1386486 mislabels those who address racial inequities as the authors of societal divisiveness
1386487 lots of self flagellating black folks pointing the finger at their lesser off brothers and sisters
1386488 yet there is not a peep about personal responsibility among the rich folks who rob us blind on a daily basis
1386489 there is nothing wrong with black america that large doses of justice political power and money cant cure capital eye
1386490 i criticize moveon for what they are not doing and that is empowering a bottom up democratic progressive movement for fundamental social and political change
1386491 it is unclear whether speaker nancy pelosi would allow a final vote

1386534 it should be ok to ask where you can go to smoke

1386537 i just want people to read it and have fun
1386538 if they have fun that works for me and well do it some more
1386539 we were particularly pleased with our results in light of softness seen in the overall economy and the operating results of many other consumer discretionary spending companies and lodging companies our adjusted ebitda of 14 0 million for the second quarter was toward the top end of our guidance also our year to date same store revenue per available room revpar growth through june 30 which effectively normalizes results for the effect of the shift in the timing of the easter holiday and related school spring breaks for 2008 and 2007 was 4 2 percent also our june 2008 same store revpar gain was 8 1 percent over june 2007 we believe these trends show that our business model held up well throughout the first half of 2008
1386540 our portfolio results for the second quarter continue to reflect the growth and strength of our great wolf lodge brand
1386541 the second quarter marked the first full quarter with operating results of our two newest properties located in grapevine texas which opened in december 2007 and grand mound wash
1386542 we continue to monitor the marketplace for feedback from our guests regarding their experiences at our resorts to ensure that we maintain the high level of service comfort and quality that our customers expect from a great wolf lodge
1386543 in a slowing nationwide economy we remain focused on keeping our position as a preferred convenient and affordable vacation alternative for families our guests typically live within a few hours drive of our resorts which means that rising gasoline prices have only a minimal impact on the typical familys cost of a great wolf resort vacation we believe that compared to the cost and logistical challenges of air travel to a destination resort or theme park we offer a strong combination of convenience and price value for families
1386544 group bookings in the 2008 second quarter accounted for approximately 16 8 percent of our room nights sold versus 13 8 percent of room nights in the 2007 second quarter an increase of almost 15 000 group rooms
1386545 this focus on increasing group business helped expand our second quarter same store occupancy to 65 3 in 2008 from 62 0 in 2007 room rates for group business are generally lower than for our leisure customers so the increase in group business in addition to the shift in the easter holiday contributed to a decline in same store average daily rate in the 2008 second quarter as compared to last year we believe we do obtain an added benefit of what is effectively increased marketing exposure when we increase our group business however by demonstrating our unique family friendly resorts to meeting attendees
1386546 our generation i properties continue to feel the combined impact of the regional economic difficulties of the u s automobile industry and high levels of competition
1386547 we are pleased however that our generation ii resorts which better reflect our development program going forward continue to show robust same store growth and we believe their size and scale also create higher barriers to potential competition even with the shift in the easter holiday we achieved revpar growth of 4 3 percent and ancillary non rooms spending increased approximately 2 percent per occupied room
1386548 we are currently in discussions with the lenders to obtain a one year extension prior to the loans maturity date on november 30 2008
1386549 other than the mason mortgage loan the company does not expect to have any significant debt maturities until mid 2011
1386550 in todays turbulent capital markets we remain selective in our uses of capital and are extremely focused on monitoring the ongoing construction processes at our grapevine and concord resorts
1386551 also we think our prospective development strategy consisting primarily of licensing arrangements and joint ventures allows us the most efficient and effective use of our capital
1386552 assuming the extension of the mason loan we are confident that we will have sufficient liquidity to operate our business absent any significant downturn in our expected operating results
1386553 our concord resort is in the heart of a popular tourist destination which currently is undergoing significant expansion especially at the nearby lowes motor speedway
1386554 we fit in well with the mix of other hospitality and entertainment offerings many of which attract a lot of families our property will be the premier indoor waterpark destination in the carolinas with our construction financing in place we now have begun drawing down on that loan in the 2008 third quarter
1386555 we are excited about the potential prospects for each of these projects
1386556 we do not intend however to enter into any new significant capital commitments under our development program until the capital markets stabilize as these projects under letters of intent are large complex and require access to reasonably priced capital their timing is hard to predict with certainty we continue to move forward with the planning process however to position ourselves to move ahead at the appropriate time additionally we are actively involved in the evaluation process on several u s and international potential sites for future resort development we currently expect all of our future domestic and international prospects to be developed through licensing arrangements or joint ventures we continue to see these avenues as the prudent way to grow our company while maintaining reasonable overall leverage
1386557 it is clear that the leisure and hospitality sectors are feeling the impact of a softening economy
1386558 our portfolio of properties continues to post good results with occupancy revpar and revpor remaining strong year to date because of our resorts close proximity to major population centers or other tourist destinations we believe that they continue to be convenient affordable family vacation alternatives even in a tighter economy looking at trends through july we remain optimistic about our operating results for our third quarter which is traditionally our largest contributor of adjusted ebitda for the year based on our current operating outlook we are increasing the low end of our guidance for full year adjusted ebitda from 62 0 million to 63 0 million consequently our full year adjusted ebitda guidance is now a range of 63 0 70 0 million
1386559 the investigators are well aware that their work is not exempt from imperfections
1386560 they worked with an enormous margin of error and they achieved very little in terms of conclusive results especially with regards to the fate of the unfortunate child
1386561 this is not unfortunately a police story a crime fit for the investigative mind of a sherlock holmes or a hercule poirot guided by the illusion that the forces of law and justice always restore order
1386562 he then realised the man was staring fixedly at the area in question very focused on what he was doing and did not notice flacks presence
1386563 he said he did not remember seeing the man there before or anywhere else in luz since madeleines disappearance
1386564 this material was never shown to kate gerry jane tanner or anyone else in the group
1386565 seeing it in the files in the last day or so is the first they have known about it again one has to ask what the police were doing by not making this material available at the time
1386566 no element of proof whatsoever was found which allows us to form any lucid sensible serious and honest conclusion about the circumstances of madeleines disappearance
1386567 it is obvious that neither of the defendants gerald or kate acted with intent
1386568 they could not predict that the resort where they had chosen to spend a few days holiday would leave the lives of any of their children in danger
1386569 it was located in a quiet place where the majority of residents are foreign citizens of the same nationality and without any known history of this type of crime
1386570 it seems obvious to us that the crimes of exposure or abandonment can be eliminated
1386571 while it is a fact that madeleine disappeared from the ocean club apartment the circumstances and manner of how this happened is not known
1386572 everyone was having a good time lindsay and sam were very comfortable with the group around you can tell theyre so in love
1386573 lindsay seemed to really fit in it seemed like everyone really likes her
1386574 one of them says that he proposed and i said no and the other says he proposed and i said yes and were getting married neither one is true
1386575 im looking for something new and exciting to do i want to do something dark or a comedy
1386576 theres tons of icons that i would love to work with on something new and exciting
1386577 lo spaccio di droghe la prostituzione laccattonaggio e i venditori ambulanti abusivi
1386578 e per far questo ha sottolineato il ministro dellinterno roberto maroni saranno messi a disposizione delle amministrazioni locali cento milioni di euro da investire nella sicurezza urbana
1386579 saranno in grado di imporre una stretta allillegittimit strisciante per salvaguardare lincolumit pubblica e offrire maggiore sicurezza ai cittadini
1386580 perch i soldati in citt ha ribadito maroni sono la strada giusta per garantire maggiore sicurezza ai cittadini e per far capire ai delinquenti che lo stato c e non arretra
1386581 we were particularly pleased with our results in light of softness seen in the overall economy and the operating results of many other consumer discretionary spending companies and lodging companies our adjusted ebitda of 14 0 million for the second quarter was toward the top end of our guidance also our year to date same store revenue per available room revpar growth through june 30 which effectively normalizes results for the effect of the shift in the timing of the easter holiday and related school spring breaks for 2008 and 2007 was 4 2 percent also our june 2008 same store revpar gain was 8 1 percent over june 2007 we believe these trends show that our business model held up well throughout the first half of 2008
1386582 our portfolio results for the second quarter continue to reflect the growth and strength of our great wolf lodge brand
1386583 the second quarter marked the first full quarter with operating results of our two newest properties located in grapevine texas which opened in december 2007 and grand mound wash
1386584 we continue to monitor the marketplace for feedback from our guests regarding their experiences at our resorts to ensure that we maintain the high level of service comfort and quality that our customers expect from a great wolf lodge
1386585 in a slowing nationwide economy we remain focused on keeping our position as a preferred convenient and affordable vacation alternative for families our guests typically live within a few hours drive of our resorts which means that rising gasoline prices have only a minimal impact on the typical familys cost of a great wolf resort vacation we believe that compared to the cost and logistical challenges of air travel to a destination resort or theme park we offer a strong combination of convenience and price value for families
1386586 group bookings in the 2008 second quarter accounted for approximately 16 8 percent of our room nights sold versus 13 8 percent of room nights in the 2007 second quarter an increase of almost 15 000 group rooms
1386587 this focus on increasing group business helped expand our second quarter same store occupancy to 65 3 in 2008 from 62 0 in 2007 room rates for group business are generally lower than for our leisure customers so the increase in group business in addition to the shift in the easter holiday contributed to a decline in same store average daily rate in the 2008 second quarter as compared to last year we believe we do obtain an added benefit of what is effectively increased marketing exposure when we increase our group business however by demonstrating our unique family friendly resorts to meeting attendees
1386588 our generation i properties continue to feel the combined impact of the regional economic difficulties of the u s automobile industry and high levels of competition
1386589 we are pleased however that our generation ii resorts which better reflect our development program going forward continue to show robust same store growth and we believe their size and scale also create higher barriers to potential competition even with the shift in the easter holiday we achieved revpar growth of 4 3 percent and ancillary non rooms spending increased approximately 2 percent per occupied room
1386590 we are currently in discussions with the lenders to obtain a one year extension prior to the loans maturity date on november 30 2008
1386591 other than the mason mortgage loan the company does not expect to have any significant debt maturities until mid 2011
1386592 in todays turbulent capital markets we remain selective in our uses of capital and are extremely focused on monitoring the ongoing construction processes at our grapevine and concord resorts
1386593 also we think our prospective development strategy consisting primarily of licensing arrangements and joint ventures allows us the most efficient and effective use of our capital
1386594 assuming the extension of the mason loan we are confident that we will have sufficient liquidity to operate our business absent any significant downturn in our expected operating results

1386599 it is clear that the leisure and hospitality sectors are feeling the impact of a softening economy
1386600 our portfolio of properties continues to post good results with occupancy revpar and revpor remaining strong year to date because of our resorts close proximity to major population centers or other tourist destinations we believe that they continue to be convenient affordable family vacation alternatives even in a tighter economy looking at trends through july we remain optimistic about our operating results for our third quarter which is traditionally our largest contributor of adjusted ebitda for the year based on our current operating outlook we are increasing the low end of our guidance for full year adjusted ebitda from 62 0 million to 63 0 million consequently our full year adjusted ebitda guidance is now a range of 63 0 70 0 million
1386601 we got engaged in the brazilian rainforest and i wanted a wedding blessing that would top my proposal
1386602 it was unbelievable looking down and seeing my family and friends below was just incredible
1386603 i will fight for a place in the team but madrid has many stars and if i end up on the bench that wont be a problem
1386604 madrid has one objective this season to win the champions league i can help them the important thing is to play
1386605 my view is that there should be a resolution to do away with the international portion of the torch relay
1386606 i believe they are wonderful in the host country but the high risk and low reward of the international leg is now obvious
1386607 the international leg of the beijing olympic torch relay was close to a disaster that was beyond the control of the ioc and the organising committee
1386608 my commission which examined the issue felt that there should not be an international relay the risks were obvious and should have been assessed more closely the result was that there was a crisis
1386609 in my country we were in full boycott mode with public and political opinion moving towards a boycott and i think it was only the earthquake that diverted attention away from something that would have been very serious for us
1386610 theres a medal there for us if everything goes well
1386611 we know we need to get the change right its a case of putting pressure on the other teams at the change and hoping they make a mistake
1386612 i try to be realistic there are a lot of people running faster than me at the moment if i can make the semi finals that will put me in the top 16 in the world and that will be a good step forward for me
1386613 we announce that due to doping jaqson kojoroski has been withdrawn and will be replaced by alexandre rodrigues
1386614 at the brazilian federation we put all our athletes at the disposal of the brazilian olympic committee in order to perform the necessary anti doping tests exactly in order to fight against this type of attitude unfortunately it did happen in this particular case
1386615 no ps3 version of left 4 dead currently in production
1386616 if left 4 dead is big then we may see a ps3 version later or if and when we do a sequel people may be more interested in that
1386617 i doubt well get rooney fit for the start of the season with the virus hes had
1386618 its a virus he picked up in nigeria and its not a nice one but quite a few have had it its such a bad virus and hes got to be training to be fit
1386619 the matter is now closed trust me he will play here next season
1386620 i hope poor adrianna isnt planning to come out as a lesbian

1386626 the reality is we will have a new president in three months and what bush and the republicans are trying to do amounts to a land grab for the oil companies
1386627 i dont think we have to give in at all pre election we have many more options postelection
1386628 midseasonreplacements the first question is obviously where do you think it all went wrong
1386629 we have a recovery plan in place and have forecast a surplus in our annual plan for 2008 9
1386630 the full extent of which were not brought to the attention of the trust board or disclosed to monitor until june 2008
1386631 the trust experienced significant pressures in 2006 07 and in 2007 8
1386632 this included short term reduction in activity as primary care trusts reviewed commissioning preferences in the early part of the year and increased costs for externally provided services medical staffing and national pay restructuring
1386633 this is a challenging position for the trust and is one that we are confident of managing
1386634 die ergebnisse beruhen auf einer jahrelangen erfahrung mit designoptimierung und materialtechnologien f r perpendicular recording
1386635 wir haben all dieses wissen in die entwicklung von medien mit einer strukturbreite von 65 nanometern gesteckt die f r eine speicherdichte von 610 gbit pro quadratzoll notwendig ist
1386636 es war ein fehler mobileme gleichzeitig mit dem iphone 3g der iphone 2 0 software und dem app store zu ver ffentlichen
1386637 wir hatten alle mehr als genug zu tun und mobileme h tte ohne konsequenzen verschoben werden k nnen
1386638 i planned but i never planned for a hurricane of that nature so as methodical as i thought i was i missed out on some things that could have made recovering a little easier
1386639 i will never again have all of my resources in one geographical area it will be dispersed across the country
1386640 a structured approach to looking at your business to identify what can go wrong and to put plans in place to reduce those risks
1386641 unsere unternehmensphilosophie passt gut zum engagement f r green it gute preise und umweltbewusstsein lassen sich hervorragend miteinander vereinen

1386643 this is total retro mashup dope in a beats breaks and funksoul manner great sounds from the past dipped in a funky beat sauce for all the rockers breakers hip hopers and bigbeat headz out there
1386644 which fast is the most meritorious after the fasts of ramadan
1386645 messenger of allah i have seen you fasting in the month of shaban so frequently that i have never seen you fasting in any other month
1386646 that shaban is a month between rajab and ramadan which is neglected by many people and it is a month in which an account of the deeds of human beings is presented before the lord of the universe so i wish that my deeds be presented at a time when i am in a state of fasting
1386647 prophet muhammad sall allahu alayhi wa sallam used to fast the whole of shaban i said to him messenger of allah is shaban your most favorite month for fasting he said in this month allah prescribes the list of the persons dying this year therefore i like that my death comes when i am in a state of fasting
1386648 prophet muhammad sall allahu alayhi wa sallam would sometimes begin to fast continuously until we thought he would not stop fasting and sometimes he used to stop fasting until we thought he would never fast i never saw the messenger of allah sall allahu alayhi wa sallam fasting a complete month except the month of ramadan and i have never seen him fasting in a month more frequently than he did in shaban
1386649 i never saw the messenger of allah sall allahu alayhi wa sallam fasting in a month so profusely as he did in the month of shaban he used to fast in that month leaving only a few days rather he used to fast almost the whole of the month
1386650 i have never seen the messenger of allah fasting for two months continuously except in the months of shaban and ramadan
1386651 do not fast after the first half of the month of shaban is gone
1386652 do not precede the month of ramadan with one or two fasts
1386653 once prophet muhammad sall allahu alayhi wa sallam performed the salah of the night tahajjud and made a very long sajdah until i feared that he had passed away
1386654 allah almighty descends in a manner he best knows it in the night occurring in the middle of shaban and forgives a large number of people more than the number of the fibers on the sheep of the tribe kalb
1386655 this is the middle night of shaban allah frees in it a large number of the people from fire more than the number of the hair growing on the sheep of the tribe kalb but he does not even look at a person who associates partners with allah or at a person who nourishes malice in his heart against someone or at a person who cuts off the ties of kinship or at a man who leaves his clothes extending beyond his ankles as a sign of pride or at a person who disobeys his parents or at a person who has a habit of drinking wine
1386656 allah almighty looks upon all those created by him in the middle night of shaban and forgives all those created by him except the one who associates partners with him or the one who has malice in his heart against a muslim
1386657 as far as bill is concerned the club has been for sale for the last five years this is nothing new
1386658 bill has always said that he would sell the club if the right people with the right finance came along
1386659 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1386660 it is not just a new face we need it is new faces my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably will not be ready to start the premier league season its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle
1386661 i am hoping we will have some in before the start of the season but i am not going to turn around and say i am totally confident because you never know what happens but yes i am hoping that we will end up getting a few in
1386662 he let us know in no uncertain terms that the season is only two weeks away he told us that we had to stop feeling sorry for ourselves stop thinking about who we are going to bring in stop thinking about everything else that is going on and to just get on with playing football
1386663 it is not my intention to undo the spirit of the will but just to change the balance of it less towards charities and more towards the family
1386664 the strength of our results did surprise us though i think it shows that the childrens television standards should be updated to take that strength of community views into account
1386665 parents really feel strongly about their children seeing so much junk food advertising so they are really supportive of the government doing more in this area
1386666 we were on the 15th floor the lamps were swaying and we felt a bit dizzy said the woman
1386667 its an extraordinarily well organised syndicate of fake websites which also deliberately oversells tickets for major events on legitimate websites
1386668 the storys always the same its an unfortunate mistake or someone has let them down
1386669 they promise a refund which never happens and the credit companies end up paying all the refunds its all part of the elaborate scam
1386670 at every meeting that ive attended with young people this project has been their number one priority and i will do my utmost to ensure it is delivered
1386671 i feel strongly that we must base any planning application on fact rather than perceptions young people are a part of this community and deserve our support
1386672 the french support was of a political military diplomatic and logistic nature
1386673 considering the gravity of the alleged facts the rwandan government asks competent authorities to undertake all necessary actions to bring the accused french political and military leaders to answer for their acts before justice
1386674 the message from our community is so often one of despair
1386675 while we dont want to relax our concern its just great to discover that these animals are doing well
1386676 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group
1386677 the agreements suggest a minimum sentence of 17 years for two of them and 30 for the third if im not mistaken they would receive 5 to 8 years here under the justice and peace law

1386685 he had command issues tonight right from the first batter of the game
1386686 if this is your community you better find a new one
1386687 well it doesnt matter if a rapper came out because black gay people wouldnt support them we dont support anyone
1386688 no that isnt true the problem is even if every black gay person supported a gay rapper the rapper still wouldnt be successful we are not the white community
1386689 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
1386690 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon

1386693 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
1386694 what we have is our voice the press wants to hear us and we will use this trip as a journey of freedom to expose the tragedy of the people who are still kept in the jungle to the public here in the united states
1386695 this freedom is incredible but we have are indebted to the abductees who are still trapped in this struggle we need to do something for them

1386701 we carried out several exams and we didnt find a single problem he has not had any kind if injury over the last two or three years he was in perfect health at hamburg and he is ready and able to play for schuster
1386702 with its strong support among the gaming movie and pc industries blu ray has become the de facto next generation storage system we envision the need for a technology that can support far greater capacities as hd streaming in particular becomes commonplace and users build larger files of digital content
1386703 they play closely together mouth their toys and touch one another
1386704 frequent handwashing is the best form of infection control out there
1386705 they stimulate the immune system and can even teach kids a lesson or two in empathy
1386706 encourage them to stay active and be a role model by showing them you enjoy an active healthy lifestyle too
1386707 suggest they try new things support their interests thats how they will develop a lifelong habit of activity
1386708 too little sleep can negatively impact childrens health and learning potential
1386709 lack of sleep interferes with a childs ability to concentrate and may lead to school difficulties behavior problems and even misdiagnosis of attention deficit performance
1386710 since these viral infections are rapidly acquired with sexual debut its recommended that girls receive this protection between the ages of 11 and 18 before embarking on sexual activities
1386711 it will be many years before we can state with certainty that they will protect against cervical cancer but the evidence is highly convincing that it does protect against the viruses that are responsible
1386712 it was an over enthusiastic response from a member of staff
1386713 it is not something that the party would condone at all
1386714 registered two votes to what i thought was a flawed poll
1386715 the change in ratings is not a reflection of a sudden change in the south wests political colours but another example of political spin
1386716 it was a very over enthusiastic response by a junior member of staff and we would not condone it

1386723 it would be impossible to justify an expenditure of this scale on a debatable scheme when public funds continue to be in inadequate supply for well established needs listed in different policy documents
1386724 im also keen to meet other goans interested in the stuff i am and will bring my newly arrived xo 1 olpc and that might also be interesting

1386727 this is a gardeners vision projected upon a world size screen the thoughts feelings dreams and drives of the designers of the perfect world are familiar to every gardener worth his name though perhaps on a somewhat smaller scale some gardeners hate the weeds that spoil their design that ugliness in the midst of beauty litter in the midst of serene order some others are quite unemotional about them just a problem to be solved an extra job to be done not that it makes a difference to the weeds both gardeners exterminate them if asked or given a chance to pause and ponder both would agree weeds must die not so much because of what they are as because of what the beautiful orderly garden ought to be modern culture is a garden culture it defines itself as the design for an ideal life and a perfect arrangement of human conditions it constructs its own identity out of distrust of nature in fact it defines itself and nature and the distinction between them through an endemic distrust of spontaneity and its longing for a better and necessarily artificial order apart from the overall plan the artificial order of the garden needs tools and raw materials it also needs defence against the unrelenting danger of what is obviously a disorder the order first conceived of as a design determines what is a tool what is a raw material what is useless what is irrelevant what is harmful what is a weed or a pest it classifies all elements of the universe by their relation to itself this relation is the only meaning it grants them and tolerates and the only justification of the gardeners actions as differentiated as athe relations themselves from the point of view of the design all actions are instrumental while all the objects of action are either facilities or hindrances modern genocide like modern culture in general is a gardeners job

1386739 the control of the idf and security forces in jericho is absolute and anyone who deviates from normative behavior and engages in criminal activity or terror will be removed from there quickly i explained to them the difference between gaza and the west bank and how they will need to behave differently none of them are saints but none of them are mega terrorists either and each and every one of them was checked by the shin bet

1386743 none of them are saints but none of them are mega terrorists either and each and every one of them was checked by the shin bet
1386744 why do they always send these guys to our city
1386745 many fatah gunmen who were sent to jericho over the past few years gave us a very hard time i believe that the presence of the hilles people here wills scare away many tourists
1386746 we dont want to empty the gaza strip of its residents
1386747 if we start absorbing people from the gaza strip in the west bank we will see tens of thousands of palestinians run away from the hamas regime
1386748 the ongoing conflict between hamas and fatah only serves the interests of israel
1386749 the two groups include some of the most vulnerable women and children with urgent medical needs requiring immediate attention
1386750 we hope that all of the palestinians will be able to leave the harsh conditions of the camps sooner rather than later
1386751 what are the chances of anything like that happening again

1386898 in the present case we consider increases in the severity of storm events coupled with rising sea levels create a reasonably foreseeable risk of inundation of the subject land and the proposed dwellings which is unacceptable
1386899 there is a general consensus that some level of climate change will result in extreme weather conditions beyond the historical record that planners and others rely on
1386900 it is no longer sufficient to rely only on what has gone before to assess what may happen again in the context of coastal processes sea levels or for that matter inundation from coastal or inland storm events
1386901 of these 2 000 are destined to the surveillance of sensitive sites and targets in particular 1 000 are destined to exterior surveillance of the immigration centres or cie centres for identification and expulsion formerly known as cpt centres for temporary stay
1386902 more people are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and it is vital that firms treat them fairly
1386903 this means paying attention to their individual circumstances and not repossessing their homes when there may be an alternative solution repossession has to be the last resort
1386904 we see many homeowners owing very small amounts of money whose lives are wrecked by some particularly sub prime lenders racing to repossess
1386905 we are thrilled prince william and prince harry have agreed to attend the world premiere of our latest james bond film and are pleased this event will help raise much needed funds to support the servicemen of our country through the princes chosen charities
1386906 whilst spouses may have the skills experience or qualifications to make them the most appropriate candidate for work in their partners parliamentary or constituency office this is less likely to apply to mps children whether under 18 or young adults
1386907 furthermore recent incidents involving the employment by mps of their children demonstrate clearly the negative impact this has on public confidence in members
1386908 the proposal is therefore that mps children should no longer be able to gain paid employment in their parents constituency or parliamentary offices or in any other role relating to the parents work as an mp
1386909 i have just come back from ethiopia and i have seen the desperate struggle faced by so many families

1386911 we got engaged in the brazilian rainforest and i wanted a wedding blessing that would top my proposal

1386914 it takes approximately 20 mugs of maggots to yield just one drop of purified seraticin at present
1386915 it has been a huge team effort to get to this level and i am delighted with our progress however there is more to do if we are to realise the maximum benefits from this discovery
1386916 it takes approximately 20 mugs of maggots to yield just one drop of purified seraticin at present thus the next stage will be to confirm its exact identity using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses in order for us to produce this chemically on a larger scale
1386917 maggots are great little multi taskers they produce enzymes that clean wounds they make a wound more alkaline which may slow bacterial growth and finally they produce a range of antibacterial chemicals that stop the bacteria growing
1386918 to link a stash of knives allegedly found somewhere in the hoo peninsula to the camp for climate action is nothing but a smear campaign against us
1386919 i would suggest that a minority of people had hidden them with the intention of causing harm to police officers and possibly to the horse and dogs that we are using on patrol
1386920 the post mortems of 700 koalas earlier this year showed koalas are now starving to death due to loss of food and the disease rates are going up
1386921 it would be a great tragedy if we stood by and let the koalas of southeast queensland be wiped out
1386922 we face total loss of koalas within 20 years we need to take on issues that in the past we have felt were too tough on residents frankly weve been too cautious and its time to take tougher action doing nothing is not an option
1386923 the extended viciousness and cruelty of this attack on christopher obrien almost defies belief
1386924 notwithstanding that knowledge you co operated in doing things aimed at protecting those who had killed obrien
1386925 chris was the most beautiful person to hear what actually happened in his last hours of life days of life is just so upsetting

1386936 weve actually tested it to a far greater standard than normally would happen and weve got certificates from both queensland health and the environmental protection agency saying that its clean clean to the highest use so you could actually put residential there and there is no maintenance program
1386937 i can only imagine the pain that the family has suffered not knowing what was behind the murder and who was responsible

1386940 lemigrazione umbra nel secondo dopoguerra foto documenti e testimonianze della comunit di fossato di vico
1386941 il lavoro sottolinea catia monacelli direttore del museo dellemigrazione pietro conti parte da un inquadramento storico del fenomeno che ha fortemente caratterizzato la regione umbra vengono pubblicati per la prima volta dati inediti sui flussi migratori e preziosi estratti darchivio per dare poi spazio ai racconti di vita dei protagonisti emergono cos ritratti vividi ed immediati dellemigrazione non solo come fenomeno collettivo ma anche come esperienza privata in cui sentimenti impressioni e particolari circostanze dipingono originali spaccati di vita

1386948 we dont have that for glaucoma and thats one of the biggest clinical frustrations we have
1386949 this material has been widely used in biology because its easy to work with and can bend and flex like skin
1386950 but the problem is its not conductive and if you want to make it sensing it has to be conductive
1386951 this device is really a breakthrough in real time iop monitoring
1386952 we dont have a means right now to measure pressure in real time outside of the clinic because of that we are missing the fluctuations in iop that could be pertinent to the pathogenesis of glaucoma

1386963 nick w rdest du gerne einmal an den olympischen spielen teilnehmen
1386964 die olympischen spiele sind f r mich schon etwas ganz spezielles und etwas was ich bedauere nicht mit meiner sportart aus ben zu k nnen weil es bei olympia keine motorsportevents gibt das ist etwas was ich unheimlich gerne erleben w rde nicht so sehr als zuschauer sondern als sportler zum einen f r deutschland zum anderen das olympische dorf ich kann mir nur vorstellen dass das ein ganz spezielles erlebnis ist
1386965 es ist unwahrscheinlich dass es jemals einen olympischen grand prix geben wird kannst du dir vorstellen in einer anderen disziplin einmal bei olympia anzutreten
1386966 wenn vielleicht etwas nach meiner karriere was man noch im h heren alter aus ben k nnte ich m chte jetzt keinem zu nahe treten aber ich denke beim schie en zum beispiel ich glaube da muss man nicht unbedingt 18 sein also wenn ich es gemacht habe dann hat es immer gut funktioniert aber ich glaube es war noch nicht ganz olympianiveau
1386967 gibt es eine andere olympische sportart f r die du dich begeistern kannst
1386968 was ich fr her gerne gemacht habe ist basketball aber das f llt ja schon einmal aufgrund meiner gr e flach lacht anm d red aber das w re f r mich auch nicht das entscheidende gewesen in welcher sportart sondern einfach nur mal dabei zu sein
1386969 lime rock war ganz gro es war unser erster sieg und auch noch ganz nahe unserer fabrik auch der klassensieg von long beach war toll road america ist eine gro artige strecke und ich hoffe dass wir dort wieder auf dem podium stehen k nnen

1386971 ich habe gerade eine tolle zeit denn ich fahre wieder einen rennwagen auch meine rolle als teambesitzer gef llt mir wir lernen gerade das sportwagengesch ft kennen das sich sehr vom formelsport unterscheidet das handling des autos ist sehr hnlich zu dem eines indycars und die technologie hnelt wiederum der formel 1 es macht spa
1386972 ich freue mich sehr mit einer legende wie gil fahren zu k nnen auch in der alms anzutreten ist sehr aufregend diese serie hat einige der ausgekl geltsten rennwagen der welt und auch einige klassepiloten in road america macht das fahren immer spa
1386973 wir arbeiten sehr intensiv am acura paket in jedem rennen lernen wir eine menge und da wir nun auch das acura chassis haben machen wir mit motor und chassis gro e fortschritte ich habe hier 2000 beinahe ein champcar rennen gewonnen habe den sieg aber nie geschafft nun will ich unseren acura in die victory lane fahren noch in diesem jahr
1386974 wir gew hnen uns an das acura chassis das neue auto besitzt ein besseres handling und hat auch mehr abtrieb wir waren bisher schnell hatten aber auch pech platz drei in mid ohio hat uns viel auftrieb gegeben und ich liebe diese strecke
1386975 bisher hatten wir mit unserem agr acura nicht viel gl ck aber dieses auto ist richtig schnell und ich denke dass wir in road america gewinnen k nnen ich freue mich sehr darauf auf dieser strecke fahren zu k nnen

1386980 weve been able to put our finger on the social pulse of human connectivity on a planetary scale and weve confirmed that its indeed a small world
1386981 over the next few decades new kinds of computing applications from smart networks to automated translation systems will help make the world even smaller with closer social connections and deeper understanding among people
1386982 messenger data gives us a unique opportunity to study distances in the social network
1386983 to our knowledge this is the first time a planetary scale social network has been available to validate the well known 6 degrees of separation finding

1386987 lynda is a proven leader with strong management skills for developing local government performance auditors and leading program performance audits within the city of san jose
1386988 lyndas prior experience includes the areas of nonprofit accounting and local government so she brings a breadth of experience to palo alto that will be beneficial
1386989 i am honored to have been selected for the palo alto city auditor position
1386990 i believe in the value of performance auditing and look forward to building upon the good work of the city auditors office in providing valuable information and recommendations to the city council and residents of palo alto

1386993 this is not a democratic issue or a republican issue it is an issue that affects all of us i am committed to working with all of my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to resolve the energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to act now
1386994 i think for obama the problem is drilling and is alienating environmental activists for mccain the problem is alienating anti tax advocates who are already sort of frustrated with him on some level
1386995 we have to drill here and drill now not wait and see whether theres areas to explore not wait and see whether theres a package that needs to be put together but drill here and drill now
1386996 it includes a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1386997 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since theres so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil

1387001 whats really promising is that the senior arm of the team is going to get behind him well start on thursday but weve got a lot of cricket coming up to christmas so its an exciting time
1387002 one of the first things i wanted to do when we were going to offer him the captaincy was to sit down with him and talk to him about where he was coming from and what were his views about where he wanted the side to go and whether they matched with mine
1387003 we sat down and talked for a good hour or so and by the end of it we both felt very confident that we were coming from the same place which was exciting so i drove away quite buoyant and excited about what the future might hold
1387004 what i like about kevin is hes got a view thats going to be important in his captaincy hes passionate hes committed about the way he goes about his cricket

1387079 world war iv lets call this conflict what it is
1387080 the reason the armed operation was called operation iraqi freedom and not operation iraqi liberty was that the acronym for operation iraqi liberty would have been o i l and that o i f was more misleading
1387081 we are raising the profile of these type of issues

1387084 we all have responsibility to deal with these excesses and i sense now there is a dedication from all quarters including the media to do that

1387089 the taxpayer is being forced to hand over yet more money in order to keep this bank afloat
1387090 gordon brown and alistair darling promised taxpayers the loan to northern rock would be repaid in full but now just six months after nationalisation we learn part of that loan is being written off to recapitalise the bank after these disastrous losses
1387091 once again we are seeing how this government just cant be straight with people
1387092 alistair darling assured parliament that taxpayer loans to northern rock would be fully secured on mortgage assets this is clearly not true
1387093 3 4bn of the governments loan to northern rock is now being converted into ordinary shares which rank right at the bottom for repayment continuing losses at the bank put this money at great risk
1387094 other banks have taken the cream of northern rocks mortgages leaving the rest to curdle

1387107 how strangely will the tools of a tyrant pervert the plain meaning of words
1387108 alongside words that electrify society with their freedom and truthfulness we have words that mesmerize deceive inflame madden beguile words that are harmful lethal even
1387109 the same word can at one moment radiate great hope at another it can emit lethal rays the same word can be true at one moment and false the next at one moment illuminating at another deceptive
1387110 the language used as in advertising or political propaganda to achieve a desired effect on an audience especially through the use of words with novel or dual meanings
1387111 the systematic distortion of the meaning of certain words to confuse or mislead
1387112 totalitarians will seek to seize control of the language of politics is obvious that our own foreign affairs establishment should remain blind to what is happening is dangerous

1387150 how much jesus do you need to be a pastor
1387151 how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard and how can they hear without someone preaching to them and how can they preach unless they are sent
1387152 this was one of the best experiences i have ever gone through
1387153 with a system of education that puts up the elite good education was never designed for the masses
1387154 this is why were having all these problems in education because the idea at the root of it represents a finite idea that has to end in order for something new and better to come in
1387155 when the children cant see themselves in the education theyre not interested
1387156 there are people coming out of college with degrees that say we have achieved what this world has to offer
1387157 we are seeing the collapse of the economy but look at all the people with a doctorate in economics
1387158 how in the world can you achieve what you want when the headmaster has been disrespected
1387159 based on the success of saturday greek instruction during its first eight years we are very excited about using technology to expand its availability beyond the st louis region for the coming year
1387160 many who are contemplating seminary enrollment perceive greek to be a significant obstacle these web based classes will allow people across the country and perhaps even beyond the opportunity to master new testament greek without leaving their current employment we also hope that many who are not contemplating seminary enrollment but simply wish to learn greek for the benefit it will offer them in bible study will participate we even encourage pastors to enroll in order to improve their greek skills

1387163 we the democrats are the party of inclusion i think what we need to do starting today is to do this lets try to systematically educate the opposition rather than systemically indoctrinate them
1387164 im tired of hearing that word so at this point in time we are what you call a reassessment person when change happens you are not afraid of making that transition which you would remiss to do otherwise
1387165 now when im saying this about senator obama guys believe me ive studied this gentleman two key elements of character that he has i mean this from the heart this gentleman here not only speaks with empathy but he listens with his eyes his ears and his heart but intellectually as well last but not least let me just say if this is our next president he will in fact lead not only the democratic party but this entire country from a culture of criticism to a culture of recognition
1387166 i might have to put mr burgess on fox news
1387167 ill put mr burgess up against sean hannity hell tear him up
1387168 obviously it is disappointing because as a cricketer you want to go out there and try to give your best performance instead of sitting in the dressing room and waiting for the match to start
1387169 as an associate team we would like to play as many twenty20 matches as possible and when one match is washed out its an opportunity lost but as it has panned out we are joint winner and a winner is a winner so i am happy
1387170 the critical thing that needs to be understood about the champions league is that it is a domestic competition an invitational event involving best teams from various continents and that distinguishes it quite significantly from international events and icc events
1387171 all our directors are committed to the principle of the primacy of icc events and every one of them wants the icc champions trophy to be a successful premium quality tournament
1387172 on that basis the directors will consider whether and if so how the proposed champions league will impact on that desired outcome given its proposed start date of september 29 the reserve day of the icc champions trophy final
1387173 of course we are sure that we can convince the board that the champions league will not affect the champions trophy in any way it is a competition that involves domestic teams and we are convinced that it does not impact or devalue the icc champions trophy in any way
1387174 india australia south africa and pakistan are of the same view in this matter
1387175 since the board allows only three professionals in a squad of 25 we decided to go for two players that other states will not be thinking of
1387176 he has 15 five wicket hauls in bangladesh domestic cricket and it speaks highly of him
1387177 even sujeewa has had the experience of playing at the highest level so we are happy with the duos selection
1387178 our bowling department needs to be strengthened while the new bowlers are still young so we thought of going for experienced bowlers who can help us achieve better results
1387179 started with anil kumble and filtered down to the rest
1387180 he has a tremendous work ethic and takes test cricket very seriously to motivate the team to improve their performance wasnt really difficult the great thing about his team is they do hurt a lot when they lose thats when one knows these guys take great pride in playing for india
1387181 i can sense the team is ready to make history if every member can perform at a reasonably good level we would have done enough
1387182 the success of any test side is how each batsman sticks to his own skill and works on one or two things that he can improve we certainly dont say sehwag plays like this so the rest of the batsmen need to play like this he plays like that since he has the skill and ability to play like that
1387183 im very impressed by what he has to offer he is a young bowler learning how to go about test cricket when he is bowling his natural length he is as good as anyone in the world
1387184 they have a proven history of that we have always believed that when this team is firing on all cylinders it can match best in the world
1387185 we are giving jobs to people to scorers to administrators to groundsmen and more chances to young players if anyone can convince me of doing something wrong and against the country i will quit the icl right away
1387186 the door should be open to everybody if players like mahendra singh dhoni and sachin tendulkar emerge from the league dont they deserve to play for the country
1387187 the ipl is an event ours has a bit more substance more emphasis on our kids on the local indian players performing well and being as good as they can be and getting ready for the greater challenges in our hyderabad team five man of match awards last season were bagged by indian players the icl is promoting domestic talent more than the ipl we started first and i guess we had the first crack at the best of the young talent in this country
1387188 there is a bit of hypocrisy sachin tendulkar played in lashings with an icl player dinesh mongia will the bcci ban tendulkar its time to sit down and have a rethink you cant be hypocritical and say the players can play in english leagues but they cant do it here and you cant ban icl players from playing in the counties and leagues
1387189 i still believe that at some stage the icl will be recognised and it would be in the best interests of all the young cricketers they have to be ready when it happens and part of my job is to ensure that everyone would like to play in the ranji trophy again especially the longer version
1387190 more people are getting exposed to the game and i think they will say i have seen ipl lets see how icl respond
1387191 the players motivation has only got stronger they know if they dont perform here and if they are dropped they cant go back to play under the bcci you can be rest assured that icl performances are going to get even better this season
1387192 if we can replicate what happened last season i would say we are doing well
1387193 if the cricket is interesting and of good quality the icl would be a success
1387194 he picked it up in nigeria its not nice its 12 days to the season starts and hes not been able to train
1387195 our enemies have skillfully adapted to fighting wars in todays media age but for the most part we our country our government has not adapted

1387197 the planned use of communications to influence human attitudes and behavior
1387198 consists of political military and ideological actions conducted to induce in target groups behavior emotions and attitudes that support the attainment of national objectives
1387199 should be coordinated fully and carefully with other agencies of government

1387207 weighing up the available domestic and international information the board judged that the cash rate should remain unchanged this month
1387208 nonetheless with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1387209 this suggests further rate increases are well and truly off the table with the question now not if but when the central bank will lower the cash rate
1387210 the banks forecast remains that inflation will fall below three percent during 2010

1387277 area wide showers thursday evening were a very welcome site but things have been so dry that friday was dry enough to continue field work we are seeing a lot of water levels in ponds drop or dry up
1387278 we have had isolated rains but the dry areas in our county just get drier
1387279 rain is helping the grass begin to break dormancy but its hampering what little hay is available
1387280 showers last week have slightly improved growing conditions more rain is needed to sustain improvement
1387281 couple of days with enough scattered showers to prevent much decline in conditions but little improvement seen
1387282 very hot and humid a few scattered showers need more rain badly
1387283 dry conditions continue heavy rain occurred on friday in southern part of the county heat is taking its toll in addition to lack of rain cattlemen reducing their herds due to the lack of grazing and hay fall armyworms are appearing in pastures and hay fields pigweed battle continues
1387284 recent spotty rains have helped farmers grow their pastures and hayfields fall armyworms have become a concern with damage occurring in some fields throughout the county high heat and humidity causing some heat stress on livestock
1387285 conditions are about the same areas that have received scattered showers have significantly improved showers still not widespread enough to improve conditions drastically
1387286 seeing some corn earworms and fall armyworms on peanuts but not many big news is the discovery of what most certainly appears to be tropical spiderwort in a cotton field the first ive documented pigweed resistance is widespread but in most cases its either als or glyphosate but not both very hard to determine resistance versus bad application or spraying after weeds were too big however ive seen enough to know and my growers agree we have our work cut out for us from here on a quart of glyphosate alone is history in all but a few fields boll retention is good but plants are stunted and stink bugs are plentiful many dry land peanut fields will never lap this year but we had a lot of fields that made 3 000 pounds without lapping last year after the last two years i wont say its over until late august we have had these same dry conditions and still made crops the next 2 3 weeks will tell the tale because this struggling cotton will be cutting out without rain and peanuts will be through making pods that can mature
1387287 scattered thunder showers continue to provide rain for 85 percent of the county corn harvest began this week
1387288 even with frequent rains crops stressed within 3 days due to extreme heat during heavy reproduction stages of all crops
1387289 we still have some small areas that have been missed by the recent rains
1387290 getting frequent rainfall insects showing up in cotton and peanuts harvesting hay between showers spraying fungicides and boron on peanuts tobacco harvest in full swing spraying cotton for stink bugs
1387291 the crops have continued to get spotty rain showers most areas have got rain on the crops the crops for the most part look good at this reporting period district 9 southeast much better rainfall this week however a lot of cotton topping out at less than knee high very few peanuts have lapped the middles soybeans suffering too
1387292 with the support of more than 290 members of congress including more than 75 republicans h r 6604 was well on its way to being passed over the two thirds vote requirement sending a clear signal that transparency and enforcement would return to the commodities and futures markets then republican leadership demanded that members change their votes in order to protect president bush
1387293 h r 6604 is a bipartisan bill that passed the agriculture committee by voice vote
1387294 it is the product of a comprehensive series of hearings to examine the issues surrounding futures trading from all sides and it clearly has enough support to pass this house
1387295 we will continue to pursue meaningful steps to address the conditions that have thrown some futures markets into disorder and hope that members will have the courage of their convictions to join us
1387296 its pretty clear that the markets are not functioning as they should
1387297 without adequate oversight and transparency we will only continue down this slippery slope leaving americas family farmers and ranchers in jeopardy
1387298 there are many reasons for high energy prices this bill does not and cannot address all of them however it is a good step to addressing our concerns in the markets
1387299 i urge the senate to act quickly on similar legislation and the house to continue and work toward passing this necessary legislation
1387300 would have required transparency and improved access prevented excessive speculation by requiring the cftc establish requirements limiting speculation and strengthened the cftc with legal authority and increased staffing to address oversight surveillance and regulation
1387301 when weve had a severe shock to the market especially the corn market weve had stocks in place to moderate price and provide supply to domestic and export customers
1387302 we can lose sight of that and now were on unfamiliar territory because we havent had the same situation in the past
1387303 and in the cases of 1983 and 1988 we had substantial reserves that made a tremendous difference
1387304 yields went from 120 bushels per acre down to 85 bushels think about that percentage drop
1387305 today were facing something equally severe however we dont have the stocks that we had then
1387306 when you think about spending 25 cents to 30 cents per bushel per year for storing a portion of the crop rather than spending 1 or 2 per bushel in some cases for government payments were not being very truthful about how much it costs relative to the damage it can do when it isnt in place
1387307 millions of dollars per crop per year for the storage it would be in the high millions towards 1 billion but wed be getting a more stable price structure for farmers here and around the world it would allow those buying our commodities to pay a larger share of the cost of production and have that stock available at times like these
1387308 it isnt just livestock it is affecting so many sectors of the economy both domestic and international is coming home maybe this is a teachable moment and people will understand we should be preparing for the next go around
1387309 in my view the cost of a farmer owned grain reserve is peanuts compared to whats been spent and the damage its done in the past without the storage
1387310 thats mostly determined by where the release price is set if the release price is set too low sure itll have a downward pressure very quickly
1387311 but when you set it high enough you want downward pressure on prices just ask the livestock producers who are in extreme trouble right now
1387312 sounded kind of logical and appealing these last few years have shown they arent that relevant wed have been much better off if we could have raised the price in 1988 1999 2000 and 2001 by sopping up some of that excess for times like this
1387313 in many places im into a third replant with both corn and soybeans its been a very challenging year
1387314 how do you explain why wheat prices are high why rice prices are high you certainly cant grow corn on rice land and wheat lands are largely unsuitable for corn is ethanol responsible for high steel prices too or could there be other factors influencing commodity prices
1387315 it just doesnt track true that ethanol or even farmers take of the total supermarket dollar is responsible for the recent upsurge in food prices you must look deeper
1387316 the prudent thing would have been to implement a farmer owned reserve if wed done it then wed have stabilized prices above cost of production saved taxpayers subsidy payments and in turn those reserves would now be moderating the price of corn and providing the benefits of food and energy security
1387317 if we do that well quickly return to the same old paradigm of farmers producing below cost of production and taxpayers making up the difference the cost of production will be paid from the marketplace or from the government through subsidies and tax dollars
1387318 i cant turn it off and on with a switch its subject to the whims of mother nature i could produce a bountiful crop or as it appears this year a meager one we must have a farmer owned reserve to stabilize the ups and downs of production and stabilize the marketplace for everyone not just farmers
1387319 yet we dont have a strategic grain reserve i dont understand that are we more concerned about driving cars than eating
1387320 cereal and bakery products are projected to double in price this year the important part here is consumers see cereal prices go up when input prices rise but they never see the pass through when input prices fall
1387321 when the crop prices collapsed in 1996 the grocery store prices didnt come down at all in many cases they went up for things like pork chops ground beef and milk
1387322 thats a giant jump the world bank and the united nations food and agriculture organization project that an additional 100 million people could face malnourishment because of the current price environment
1387323 holding onto any reserves at all so the world ending stocks for corn wheat and rice have all fallen by more than 40 percent since the 1999 2000 season
1387324 the world bank has pressured countries to eliminate their own reserve programs much like the u s eliminated theirs and the eu and china reduced their buffer stock programs
1387325 countries like kenya and malawi were forced by the world bank to sell off their reserves that was partly because of fiscal austerity reasons but it was also partly to repay debt to the world bank
1387326 those included a lot of regional storage programs that were used to take in crops and bring them to market but also as a reserve against times of crisis for high food prices and a hedge against low supply
1387327 were now in a situation where theres no buffer to protect people from a severe food crisis
1387328 its absolutely critical that people understand the need to let a market oriented farm policy determine farm prices
1387329 now its a global question because were all tied together through trade agreements
1387330 no one knows how high prices will go of course on a global scale the people with the most money will buy food and those with the least will starve weve gone from freedom to farm in 1996 to freedom to starve in 2008
1387331 followed a disastrous market oriented farm policy that has destroyed family farm agriculture in this country
1387332 i see the g 8 leaders have said there may be a need for reserves after all well its a little too late to figure that out after weve lost so many farmers around the world and people are starving
1387333 part of those shocks will be from supply side weather and pests other parts might be demand side caused by government policy whether an ethanol policy the russians deciding to feed their livestock instead of slaughter them or a war
1387334 things will happen it isnt a case of just getting past this current crisis and everything will be okay we need to use this as a teachable moment and get ready for the next time
1387335 first we must prepare for the short run sort of disturbances we dont know when theyll occur but we know they will that means we need a reserve program
1387336 we need preparations for long term trends in agriculture whatever those are if it turns out the supply increases faster than demand and we know the nature of agriculture is it doesnt adjust to low prices quickly either on the supply or demand side we need to provide some price and quantity stabilization
1387337 that means an element of supply control as we move into a more globalized environment reserves need not only be at the country level but internationally coordinated obviously that adds another level of complexity
1387338 i dont know how long it will take people to get to the point where they understand how agriculture commodities differ from bolts cds and other stuff
1387339 people in regions of france drink wine from those regions so why dont americans
1387340 many rwandans know what took place during the genocide the report will probably just put together witness testimony and other evidence of their involvement and document it for the people of rwanda the expectation is that the report will be part of their history and knowing what took place during the genocide and elucidating the roles of the different actors during that tragic time
1387341 the relationship has had its problems its slows and downs based mainly on the events that took place during the genocide and the role of france during the genocide
1387342 since the new government came into power the relationship has been slowly improving so i could say that its not as good as it should be but its getting a little bit better

1387346 i doubt well get rooney fit for the start of the season with this virus he has had its a bad virus he has not been training
1387347 the matter is closed now he is a manchester united player it is finished he is going to be a player here next season believe me
1387348 the first and almost certainly the last signing we will make this season
1387349 the referee will use the captain to a far greater degree
1387350 the captain will be the first and main point of contact for the referee during the game
1387351 football engages motivates and inspires but at times we know it can spill over and get ugly
1387352 the premier league our clubs the players and the referees are all engaged we want to make sure that this ends up being much more than a campaign and results in making unacceptable behaviour just that unacceptable
1387353 punk rock is exemplary manners towards your fellow human beings
1387354 usually i would pass even reading the music blogs that are all independent music but this one was actually good because it did not seem like you had to be a scenester knowing the secret handshake to be allowed to read it they have a good collection of artists from all over the map which is always what i like to see and they have this funny ad running on there site to bring 44 to singapore
1387355 this is the coolest the water has been in 10 years
1387356 even without this i could stand here all day and watch the fish come over the ladder
1387357 you have to go to alaska to see something like this
1387358 you get less house and property for the same price but were willing to make that sacrifice to save on gas prices and commuting costs
1387359 there is a whole confluence of government policies tax spending regulatory and administrative that have subsidized sprawl
1387360 when people bought homes they punched the numbers and said can we afford the mortgage payment and taxes
1387361 this new paradigm is going to have families being more deliberate about the cost of transportation spending and energy costs thats a new phenomenon in the united states that will be the change that will change development patterns
1387362 we have to move to a new transit oriented development paradigm and concentrate development and avoid the sprawl that weve allowed in the past and undo some of the environmental damage
1387363 what were pluses of that lifestyle are now liabilities a big suv a big home to heat the energy needed to mow the lawn
1387364 and were only at the shallow end of the pool
1387365 longer term rising fuel prices produces a positive effect people living closer in and in smaller homes and close to transit
1387366 if government does something against the market it is going to fail
1387367 it is fatuous to believe that because fuel costs 4 a gallon today that we will all decide to live in apartment houses
1387368 the economic reality is that people get forced to the edge of metropolitan areas
1387369 the only answer over time is that the jobs come to them
1387370 we kind of fell into the trap of our neighbors
1387371 but ill be honest if i was single guy if we didnt have a kid and my wife was for it i would probably move out of the area
1387372 i dont believe there was any statement trying to be made
1387373 when you are homeless people look at you in a different way
1387374 housing first works because it addresses a persons basic needs for stable housing of his own clothing food and a sense of safety
1387375 it gives a person a chance to stabilize regain self confidence and control of his life then the person is more open to intervention and support
1387376 the goal is to reach the highest level of independence that is feasible for that person
1387377 the community is directly and indirectly paying the price of homelessness through increased medical and hospital costs jail costs public safety impacts including emergency and nonemergency calls to 911 impacts on the school system illegal camping paramedic responses and park clean up
1387378 ive been working just trying to get my life together
1387379 i thought i was rich when i had 8 in my pocket
1387380 a lot of people all they do is party and get drunk they beat each other up they get into trouble with the law
1387381 it was something that i kicked around for a long time because of my history
1387382 there were people who helped me and i wanted to help out other folks that were having the same issues my life would have been very different if i had gotten the right help
1387383 at some point we will use up all our fossil fuel but this will still be here
1387384 there was not one drop of fertilizer used on this crop
1387385 this crop is directly related to your pump the feasibility of this crop is dictated by the number that shows up on the pump the higher the price at the pump the more feasible this is
1387386 and thats a good thing for oregon farmers actually northwest farmers
1387387 and this is a crop that can grow easily and nicely on dry land
1387388 it does well on marginal land were looking for growers who have soil that is marginal there are literally millions of acres in oregon where the soil is marginal
1387389 this is not a food staple like corn wheat or soy beans
1387390 southwest oregon area is prime climate for camelina there are also a lot more low producing soils than high producing soils here
1387391 even if it comes out on the positive side you still have to weigh it against other commodities
1387392 but this plant will grow on lower quality soils and do well there
1387393 weve definitely seen a lot of people who are renting out their house because they cant sell it
1387394 i know that a lot of places are still on the market im feeling very lucky
1387395 the only part of the market that is moving is the lower part of the market
1387396 a lot of times people will say well gee im just paying somebodys mortgage but youre paying far less in rent than what it would be in mortgage payments and you dont have to do upkeep
1387397 we have a lot of applicants who have the financial means to buy but they dont want to buy right now because of the market so theyre choosing to rent for a year which i do think is different than the past
1387398 maybe within a year year and a half i will be looking at purchasing
1387399 the economy as far as im concerned in terms of buying a house now is the time because the rates are still good and there are more homes on the market
1387400 i think that real estate will always be a good investment but you have to go in at the right time
1387401 buying real estate should never be an impulse purchase its not like buying a pair of shoes
1387402 every available tool that metro transit has to keep the buses rolling must be on the table that includes cutting costs postponing investments innovating to maximize service efficiency and increasing fares
1387403 given the hardships faced by regional fisheries along with growing threats from climate change and pollution the time is now for full throttle execution of the governors directives
1387404 opposing all new offshore oil and gas leasing development and production
1387405 we dont have a lack of imagination or vision about this stuff we have a lack of money
1387406 for five years i have been fixated on this place
1387407 i planned my retirement i put all my life in there i had to grab that house
1387408 for five years i have been fixated on this place
1387409 i planned my retirement i put all my life in there i had to grab that house
1387410 our hope has always been that the customers would be able to purchase the homes from the bank
1387411 there are a lot of builders having issues especially smaller builders who are wrestling with cash flow and still trying to build houses
1387412 this has started a dialogue on what else is needed
1387413 youve got to say right heres the line in the sand were going to stop it here because its madness to continue
1387414 ju mer vi pratar om det ju mer f r jag en k nsla av att n gon kommit in till oss
1387415 n r inte sveriges ledande experter kan tro att den h r personen har gjort det h r hur ska d jag kunna g ra det dessutom bad de mig f rklara hur jag upplevde xx och d gjorde jag det
1387416 ju mer vi pratar om det ju mer f r jag en k nsla av att n gon kommit in till oss
1387417 n r inte sveriges ledande experter kan tro att den h r personen har gjort det h r hur ska d jag kunna g ra det dessutom bad de mig f rklara hur jag upplevde xx och d gjorde jag det
1387418 with the overwhelming popularity of our wi fi products and multi wan routers we wanted to give our customers a new way to fully leverage their investment
1387419 we are constantly looking for innovative ways to enhance our products
1387420 the vast majority of exclusions were looked as being once the commission looked at them land that had limited or no agricultural capability
1387421 and yes there is often pressure to look at agricultural land as an opportunity to relieve some of these growth pressures
1387422 thats where the commission has an obligation to be a custodian of that border and of the land uses within the alr
1387423 the fact were still losing farm land from some of the prime areas is really unacceptable
1387424 the vision has to be first how do we feed ourselves
1387425 right now were using a reserve to keep moving forward on projects
1387426 doing that means we hit a financial wall at the end of 2011 well have completely exhausted it
1387427 the venues and the villages really are an opportunity to make a positive contribution for long term community legacies
1387428 one thing that we struggle with all the time is the renewal schedule for our community centres because we have to go to the taxpayers for that and a lot of our facilities do need renewal
1387429 from an environmental standpoint theyre certainly not as efficient as the newer buildings
1387430 we were destined to fail in that commitment but we made it anyway because it was a strong principle that we believed in
1387431 anything thats non fossil fuel based is going to have benefits
1387432 weve effectively reduced the footprint by about 75 per cent which is about a quarter of the footprint of past comparable games in terms of downsizing the venues and reducing the number of buses we need to transport all those people from vancouver
1387433 yes there have been some tradeoffs but in our case many fewer than in the past
1387434 sochi russia host of the 2014 winter olympics is having to build a whole new ski area virtually from scratch the modification of the natural environment to host that games will be significant
1387435 we hope its going to be recognized as an example of a sustainable approach to the olympics i think its going to leave some important legacies for whistler
1387436 its pretty far gone so theres not a lot we can do with it
1387437 raises some eyebrows about whats really going on we know that with the level of contaminants that they have theyre probably susceptible to some disease and we want to see what we can do to help with that
1387438 green carbon the role of natural forests in carbon storage
1387439 natural forests are more resilient to climate change and disturbances than plantations
1387440 protecting the carbon in natural forests is preventing an additional emission of carbon from what we get from burning fossil fuel
1387441 the majority of biomass carbon in natural forests resides in the woody biomass of large old trees commercial logging changes the age structure of forests so that the average age of trees is much younger
1387442 the carbon stock of forests subject to commercial logging and of monoculture plantations in particular will therefore always be significantly less on average than the carbon stock of natural undisturbed forests
1387443 i think it helps increase the momentum of the feasibility of building green
1387444 for nonprofits as agents of social change it makes perfect sense
1387445 we have done our level best to notify everyone that this is coming
1387446 i am asking each of you to step up your efforts to increase savings i ask that you be creative and take action now
1387447 the high price of energy is hurting our businesses and our families anything we can do to reduce fuel consumption will ease the burden on our budget and on taxpayers
1387448 the governor is clear that we not do anything to impact public service or public safety
1387449 im glad that governor gregoire has started to recognize the budget crisis shes created she had to know that by increasing spending 33 percent in her first term she was heading the state toward a budget deficit
1387450 in addition to a hiring freeze we should also freeze salary increases for politically appointed state employees further governor gregoire should suspend salary negotiations with state employee groups over pay increases until we know the full extent of our deficit next year
1387451 judging by her frequent use of the rhetoric the governor apparently believes this is a winning message but something tells me its not going to gain much traction with voters who are worried about their economic future
1387452 we dont have a hiring freeze but we are only hiring now when it is a critical life safety or transit position
1387453 we have a very rigorous travel policy but even with that we have cut back and are limiting travel
1387454 every department has been asked to look for cost savings
1387455 we dont have any frugality measures coming out of the mayors office
1387456 that said departments look for ways to cut costs well have a better sense of the city budget later next month
1387457 it is a prudent thing any governor would do she realizes that this is going to get worse rather than better
1387458 if this werent an election year she would still be doing this
1387459 spring butterflies are significantly down for the third year in a row
1387460 every day the habitat of provincially listed endangered butterflies is disappearing
1387461 i didnt find a single butterfly in the last 10 years its been getting worse and worse this year seems to be the worst ever
1387462 whatever happens this year will determine what happens next spring
1387463 the thing everybody forgets if we want butterflies around we need to have caterpillars around
1387464 we need to put aside more protected areas and take better care of the areas we have
1387465 it requires a mandate in order to get people to do whats in their best interests sometimes its called change
1387466 we are wading into the pool not diving into the pool of green building legislation
1387467 we were most concerned about existing businesses in san francisco and their being hit with a large increase in cost
1387468 i would say this ordinance puts san francisco in a leadership position in the country on green building
1387469 this is a way for us to put our money where our mouth is
1387470 we are trying to prove that we dont eat babies for breakfast who is saying to tesco who is going to help the food poor people cant afford to eat properly but everyone is beating up on the energy companies
1387471 on one hand its about dealing with the fossil fuels issue but its also about dealing with communities and individuals that are negatively impacted as a direct result of projects
1387472 we believe that historically morally and politically the bnp is a nazi fascist party
1387473 they exist purely to cause division and disruption in our communities through violent means
1387474 its unacceptable that the bnp feels it can operate in this region
1387475 we want to make sure they know theyre not wanted here
1387476 we cannot forget what happened with the nazis 60 years ago thats why we want to mobilise as many people on this protest as we possibly can
1387477 its essential that we get involved in the campaign against the red white and blue event
1387478 its not something we want and its not something that local people are supporting either
1387479 so we will be protesting against the bnps message of racism but at the same time we have to lobby politicians over their policies
1387480 we need policies that can help working people not ones that isolate them and drive them into the arms of the fascists
1387481 we dont want a fascist festival in the east midlands
1387482 weve been quite successful in restricting the bnps activities in the region
1387483 a fascist festival is an insult to the multicultural population of the east midlands
1387484 living as i do in derby just down the road from codnor i am well aware of the concerns expressed by local residents about this red blue and white rally and i am pleased that a protest against their fascist activities is being organised
1387485 when the cameras werent there the mask came off as well
1387486 there were racist jokes and when the songs started the response was the stiff right arm fascist salute widespread amongst the audience
1387487 there was no suggestion from bnp leader nick griffin or the stewards that this was unwelcome then late in the evening in the beer tent they were playing ss marching songs on a cassette
1387488 nick griffin was there as were members of the leadership group this was all seen as perfectly normal
1387489 i went to the red white and blue festival last summer
1387490 i was only there for ten minutes on the sunday and i didnt like what i saw it was really nasty
1387491 i could never understand why all those people were calling the bnp fascists well i do now dont vote for them they are not what they seem and like me youll regret it
1387492 the filling of the time away from the job also becomes dependent on the market which develops to an enormous degree those passive amusements entertainments and spectacles that suit the restricted circumstances of the city and are offered as substitutes for life itself
1387493 since they become the means of filling all the hours of free time they flow profusely from corporate institutions which have transformed every means of entertainment and sport into a production process for the enlargement of capital
1387494 so enterprising is capital that even where the effort is made by one or another section to find a way to nature sport or art through personal activity and amateur or underground innovation these activities are rapidly incorporated into the market so far as is possible
1387495 this is a much stronger vehicle than the one used before and he did that on purpose to make sure thats where the money goes
1387496 in 1988 the city council under the leadership of former mayor bud clark not only identified the pending maintenance backlog but also put in place a funding mechanism to address it a mechanism which was ignored and overruled by the katz administration
1387497 time for transit amp bike supporters to pay their fare shair
1387498 there will be joint action between the unions commencing with an all out strike on wednesday 20 august
1387499 this is due to the employers failure to properly address the issue of low pay within scottish local government
1387500 there is a bigger issue here some of our members get only 8p more than the minimum wage and this needs to be dealt with
1387501 this result is a clear rejection of an inadequate offer our members are clear that they cannot afford another series of below inflation pay increases
1387502 inflation is at 4 6 percent and key items on household bills like bread and milk are increasing even faster by as much as 14 percent just this week gas prices went up 35 percent
1387503 our members are not the cause of inflation they are the victims of it
1387504 they have the worst pay holidays parental rights and sick pay in the public sector and without them vital services will fall apart
1387505 the offer is a pay cut increases the differential between higher and low paid and locks us into likely pay cuts for three years
1387506 we need to have a pay award that goes somewhere towards giving us a living wage
1387507 most of us have another job and some of us two other jobs just to support our families
1387508 what we are trying to do is put a clear message to cosla and the scottish employers that a below inflation pay rise is unacceptable effectively it is a pay cut
1387509 over three years it is a miserly increase of just 45p per hour
1387510 we had a high turn out in the ballot in dundee there was quite a large response from our membership through the special general meeting and the departmental meetings we held
1387511 international solidarity can play a big part in helping to release the detainees
1387512 security forces told militants who were freed following the riots that they must have had friends in the egyptian foreign ministry after an international outcry embarrassed the government
1387513 within the last three months weve had multiple companies racing each other through the doors
1387514 when we typically have little mountain ranges every time the air moves past its pushed up and over
1387515 theyre testing to see whether or not its sufficient for wind power development
1387516 oregon in the next couple of years will move from around ninth in the country for wind power production to maybe third
1387517 other parts of the state are really kind of tuning in to the idea of big wind
1387518 we may not have as much as people would like us to have available
1387519 you put up meteorological poles all over the place to test the wind because the one thing you can never mitigate for is bad wind
1387520 what youre looking for in wind energy is geographic diversity
1387521 where theres a big concentration of wind right now it peaks in the spring
1387522 the best and cheapest way to meet the renewable requirements is to do a majority of wind
1387523 i know there are at least four companies that have had some interest within harney county and i know that theres a minimum of 10 sites that at first glance they say might be doable
1387524 a lot of this has been what if until this point
1387525 what i hear is pretty positive support for having sustainable energy for getting away from dependence on foreign oil and the job creation
1387526 the landowner told me that this may provide his family with the opportunity to keep an old time ranch in one piece in their family for several generations
1387527 and that beats the heck out of 100 different ranchettes
1387528 wind power from southeastern oregon can balance wind power in the columbia gorge and make more efficient use of the electrical grid
1387529 to that extent were starting to get ready from a logistical standpoint
1387530 this things happening so fast that im not sure anybodys got it
1387531 were not trying to stop development there could be some detrimental effects if its not done right

1387538 our work is valued and appreciated by both coworkers and patients
1387539 its important to note just because we want to try to get a better understanding of whats going on
1387540 we want a world order that is more democratic more balanced in which the asymmetries are progressively done away with
1387541 its not a question of an aspiration of brazil its a question of the legitimacy of the decisions of the security council
1387542 i think brazil should emphasize first its development and then worry about solidarity with other countries
1387543 we can help the others after we become a leading country internationally ourselves
1387544 brazil has turned from lets say a country with tremendous foreign debt to one that has the largest surplus in its recent history and that really is due to chinese demand
1387545 brazil has not been emphasizing its relations with the u s and europe
1387546 it has not been focusing on countries that are going to generate commercial relationships so that brazil can grow and develop

1387592 the pensions crisis is becoming extremely personal when people are losing sleep over being unable to save enough for retirement
1387593 when the pressures of the current short term economic climate are added to the mix it is almost surprising that more of us are not lying awake at night worrying it is clear however that many of us are waking up to the idea that we have to take responsibility for our own retirements and that is a long term commitment
1387594 it is encouraging that this message is getting through and there is plenty that we can all do to ensure we get the retirement we want and deserve the uk needs a new approach to retirement income and planning for retirement that should involve more than simply saving into a pension but should also involve looking at all sources of income

1387622 the probability of a crisis scenario similar to the early 1990s is increasing if the erm exchange rate mechanism scenario were to become reality the main concern would not be earnings but capital we estimate that a non performing loan ratio of 10pc to 15pc for developers loans would fully erase earnings in 2009 and would represent between 20pc to 30pc of the current tangible capital base of banco popular sabadell and banesto

1387637 has the pattern of recent warming over the late nineteenth and the twentieth centuries caused significant changes in the density of trees at the treeline and or an extension of the geographical location of the treeline
1387638 temperature increases over the past century are already producing demonstrable changes in the population density of trees but these changes have not yet generated an extension of conifer species limits to or beyond the former positions occupied during the medieval warm period mwp ca ad 800 1300 or the holocene thermal maximum treeline extension htm broadly taken here to be ca 10 000 3 000 years ago
1387639 the treeline was located 100 140 m higher in elevation than today during the mwp
1387640 forest has yet to recolonize these elevations kremenetski et al 2004
1387641 the treeline was at its highest elevation during the mwp between ca ad 900 and 1300 when it reached 340 m
1387642 descended to approximately 270 m during the little ice age and then ascended to its present elevation of approximately 310 m during the recent warming of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries
1387643 at the russian sites studied the impact of twentieth century warming has not yet compensated fully for the mortality and range constriction caused by the cold temperatures of the little ice age
1387644 these results are similar to observations in some other northern treeline regions such as uplands in eastern quebec and interior labrador where picea mariana p mill b s p and picea glauca moench voss trees remain below their pre little ice age limits despite recent warming gamache and payette 2005 payette 2007
1387645 between 1994 and 2006 up to 35 of birds reared second broods
1387646 during seasons with warm springs early nests were better protected by being hidden in newly emerged reeds
1387647 as a result these nests suffered fewer losses from predation
1387648 it would appear that the studied population of reed warblers benefits from climate warming
1387649 the productivity and vitality of forest trees depend on their access to soil resources
1387650 in forest ecosystems mycorrhizal associations constitute the interface between nutrients in the soil solution and the uptake organs of trees
1387651 there was a significant positive effect of elevated co 2 on ecm parameters
1387652 the response in long term experiments was significantly higher than that in experiments of shorter duration
1387653 this response is not transient but persistent and even increases over time
1387654 rice a c 3 plant is one of the most important staple foods for human nutrition with the highest productivity associated with paddy flooded cropping systems
1387655 barnyardgrass a c 4 plant is well adapted to flooded environments and is a major limitation to rice yields in eastern china
1387656 the growth of rice was examined in both monoculture and in competition with a common weed barnyard grass at two levels of nitrogen supply 0 357 and 1 071 mmol n l and two levels of co 2 ambient and ambient 200 ppm under field conditions in eastern china
1387657 when grown in mixture the proportion of rice biomass increased relative to that of barnyardgrass under elevated co 2 if the supply of nitrogen was adequate
1387658 if nitrogen was low elevated co 2 significantly reduced the proportion of leaf area and root biomass of rice relative to barnyard biomass
1387659 although data from this experiment confirm that competitiveness of rice could be enhanced relative to c 2 in situ the data also indicate that such a response could be contingent on the supply of nitrogen

1387674 kevin will bring kevin pietersen which is crucial hell be his own man and thats going to be really important
1387675 whats really promising is that the senior arm of the team is going to get behind him well start on thursday but weve got a lot of cricket coming up to christmas so its an exciting time
1387676 one of the first things i wanted to do when we were going to offer him the captaincy was to sit down with him and talk to him about where he was coming from and what were his views about where he wanted the side to go and whether they matched with mine
1387677 we sat down and talked for a good hour or so and by the end of it we both felt very confident that we were coming from the same place which was exciting so i drove away quite buoyant and excited about what the future might hold
1387678 what i like about kevin is hes got a view thats going to be important in his captaincy hes passionate hes committed about the way he goes about his cricket
1387679 hes positive and hes prepared to work extremely hard to get what he wants from the game

1387685 assessed how well the current day state of the art reanalyses and cgcms coupled global climate models are reproducing the annual mean seasonal cycle variability and trend of the observed sat surface air temperature over the arctic ocean for the late 20th century where sea ice changes are largest
1387686 large uncertainties are still found in simulating the climate of the 20th century
1387687 almost two thirds of the ipcc ar4 fourth assessment report models have biases that are greater than the standard deviation of the observed sat variability
1387688 can not capture the observed dominant sat mode variability in winter and seasonality of sat trends
1387689 the majority of the models show an out of phase relationship between the sea ice area and sat biases
1387690 there is no obvious improvement since the ipcc third assessment report

1387696 a successive cold period 450 950 ad the dark ages
1387697 was terminated by the onset of the medieval warm period 950 1400 ad
1387698 the little ice age 1400 1850 ad including the maunder minimum at around 1700 ad

1387702 temperature variation of about delta t 1 99 0 37 c between the little ice age and present day
1387703 ended around the years 1930 1940 ad and was followed by a relatively cold period between the years 1940 and 1995
1387704 favors the hypothesis that the multi decadal oscillation revealed in 13 c from the two different environments is connected to the solar activity
1387705 increased chemical weathering in relation to higher temperatures and or precipitation
1387706 does not appear to be unusual when the proxy records spanning the last two millennia are examined
1387707 despite many studies that have pointed to the validity of the classical climatic oscillations described for the late holocene medieval warm period little ice age etc there is a research line that suggests the non global signature of these periods ipcc 2001 jones and mann 2004
1387708 the best way to solve this controversy would be to increase the number of high resolution records covering the last millennia and to increase the spatial coverage of these records
1387709 a high resolution pollen record in combination with geochemical data from sediments composed mainly of layers of charophytes alternating with layers of vegetal remains plus some detrital beds
1387710 a cold and arid phase during the subatlantic late iron cold period ad 1400
1387711 the iberian peninsula is unique as it is located at the intersection between the mediterranean and the atlantic europe and africa and is consequently affected by all of them
1387712 the classical climatic oscillations described for the late holocene medieval warm period little ice age etc
1387713 is identified at about a similar date all around the world china chu et al 2002 arabia fleitmann et al 2004 africa filippi and talbot 2005 iceland doner 2003 central europe filippi et al 1999 new guinea haberle and david 2004 usa cabaniss pederson et al 2005 argentina mauquoy et al 2004 etc
1387714 comparable changes are described by desprat et al 2003 julia et al 1998 and riera et al 2004 in northwest central and northeast spain
1387715 are related to temperatures during the short summer season that prevails in this region
1387716 suggest that tropical cyclones are becoming more powerful with the most dramatic increase in the north atlantic
1387717 the increase is correlated with an increase in ocean temperature
1387718 a debate our italics concerning the nature of these increases
1387719 some studies attributing them to natural fluctuations and others suggesting climate change related to anthropogenic increases in radiative forcing from greenhouse gases
1387720 the question of whether we can ascribe a change in tropical cyclone intensity to anthropogenic climate change is still open
1387721 with some models showing an increase in the atlantic and others a decrease
1387722 during the second half of the little ice age when sea temperatures near puerto rico were a few degrees celsius cooler than today which provides some evidence that todays warmth is not needed for increased storminess
1387723 sedimentary ridges in australia left behind by ancient tropical cyclones indicate that activity from the last century under represents the continents stormy past
1387724 to distinguish changes in overall activity from changes in local activity due to shifts in storm tracks
1387725 to understand how climate influences local changes in tropical cyclone activity more research is needed to identify factors influencing tropical cyclone tracks

1387776 it is something of an irony that a land whose timeless beauty has survived basically unchanged since biblical times is being transformed by a people who base their claim to it on biblical history wildernesses have become national parks that are barred to palestinians and arab villages that once blended organically into the landscape are little more than besieged ghettos

1387784 delta remains committed to providing a travel experience that maximizes the time our customers spend with us onboard by offering them even more productivity options
1387785 our customers asked for in flight connectivity and were responding by rolling out the most extensive wi fi network in the sky beginning this fall our passengers will have the ability to stay connected when they travel with us throughout the continental u s
1387786 the advent of air to ground atg technology has made broadband connectivity in the cabin economically viable for the first time for commercial airlines
1387787 the game has changed and delta will be among the first to provide an enhanced customer experience with broadband wi fi access on more than 1 000 daily flights within the u s
1387788 our customers are watching their dollars and stater bros is doing all we can to provide the best value in the products we sell and the services we provide
1387789 this club offers pharmacy patients exceptional value with its broad range of drugs covered competitive pricing and superior convenience of our 6 300 locations
1387790 we continue to be concerned that scarce industry resources are being used to fix a problem that does not exist all my life i have heard if it aint broke dont fix it we have the national automotive service task force that is there to protect independent repairers from service information gaps and to provide assistance with future training and tool needs we need to focus on more training for independent technicians thats our future
1387791 when we began this process last year even our own members thought taking on car manufacturers was daunting
1387792 but they came to understand this is an issue of survival for them and for their customers when the manufacturers fail to provide us equal access to that information the consumers are directly and negatively impacted
1387793 i was in dozens of meetings with representatives from all corners of the state and i can tell you that they understand that this is a consumer issue first and then an economic issue about jobs in this economy
1387794 with the new fuel and the new engine technologies coming into play our technicians will need more and more advanced training vocational education schools will tell you that they need more equipment and more resources for students that are moving into the workplace
1387795 wouldnt it be a positive thing if the money being spent advancing right to repair legislation was invested in making long term improvements in the training and recruitment of top rate technicians for the industry as a whole
1387796 the car manufacturers know better but they dont have any other defense for their opposition because this is a pro consumer bill
1387797 what else would they say that they are anti consumer
1387798 auto manufacturers are proud of our progress and are committed to providing independent repairers the access and information needed to repair todays vehicles we encourage the members of aaia automotive aftermarket industry association and care coalition for automotive repair equality to use nastf national automotive service task force and help identify any gaps in service information that may exist

1387802 everything i needed to know about woman i learned on oru summer missions
1387803 well thanks mike you know i never feel quite so old as i do when i m with you
1387804 yeah i didnt quite know what you kept looking at so when i got into the car i saw it someone loves me a little too much
1387805 everything was going very well until we arrived in maoz esther
1387806 from behind a little hill suddenly emerged some cars and policemen wearing civilian clothes but with police hats and they arrested the one who shot in the air as well as some of our other escorts who were carrying weapons
1387807 apparently the police were waiting and watching the whole time doing nothing until our boy shot in the air
1387808 the fact is that police forces were there we understood that like last week when there was a violent incident when the hikers came to the bedouin with weapons we were ready because we knew that this was a place of confrontation the bedouin set up cameras and therefore the police were there
1387809 if the police were there and watched the confrontation why did the police not just stand openly and prevent the hikers from passing if it was not permitted why did they not just stop them the situation as i see it looks like an ambush hiding out like thieves in the night
1387810 im not the one who decides there are officers above me who decide what is overt and what is concealed
1387811 i have asked the public security minister avi dichter for a response and i expect to receive an answer within a few days i have no doubt that the police were engaged in a provocation just as they have been in other places such as a recent incident in the southern mount hevron area and elsewhere
1387812 another step in the police agreeing to become a political police in the service of the olmert government
1387813 police were surprised that to see how we managed to break through their barriers
1387814 and suddenly we appeared 200 youths right under their noses after that they let us continue
1387815 some judges are more concerned for the civil rights of persons who happen to be present during a violent incident while others are more willing to accept the polices approach and hold responsible those who are present its a problem

1387872 in a time when we all are feeling the pinch of high energy and food costs its encouraging to know the american public realizes the benefits of soy biodiesel as a clean burning renewable homegrown fuel
1387873 the soybean checkoff believes its important that consumers understand the rising cost of petroleum represents the major reason for higher consumer food prices and that biodiesel represents a viable useful and beneficial alternative to imported oil
1387874 demand for soy biodiesel has very little impact on the price of food
1387875 a soybean consists mostly of protein rich meal and 98 percent of that meal is used to feed animals that produce food such as poultry pork beef and fish
1387876 a soybean checkoff study found that demand for biodiesel made from soybean oil increases the supply of soybean meal which will be largely used to produce more food not less
1387877 u s soybean farmers are estimated to have sown 74 5 million acres this year to help meet global food demand

1387899 we never had to look for people they found us
1387900 and now we have a waiting list of 67 people who want our service so we are hiring two more farmers to work with us next year
1387901 that compares favourably to the supermarket and you know what youre eating
1387902 and there are lots of like minded people out there who are concerned about their food source and the damage being done to the land and their bodies by the pesticides being used
1387903 what we find is that people are really interested in getting pure real food and this is a way to make it happen my vision is that an acre of land be set aside with every new housing development so that a farmer can be hired to grow food for the local householders
1387904 most of our farms are in lower income neighbourhoods in some cases students prefer to hire us to grow their food rather than spend it in the grocery store we are delighted to discover that we are not a service for the rich

1387930 officials committed what a dispassionate jury would recognize as a series of serious crimes under american law in the years after 2001
1387931 the annual breakdown of the doha round of trade talks is becoming a summer ritual it is time to be brave swallow hard and accept that the doha round in its present form has failed
1387932 the greatest expansions of world trade have tended to come not from the bloodless t ntonnement of some fictional walrasian auctioneer but from the barrel of a maxim gun the edge of a scimitar or the ferocity of nomadic horsemen
1387933 each era can be seen as one in which trade is conducted within a geopolitical framework established by the previous major war or conflict that is in turn altered by the outbreak of the next war setting the stage for the next epoch and so on it is natural to suspect that the accumulating economic and geopolitical tensions unleashed in the course of each period of peace prosperity and trade culminate in successive rounds of conflict so that wars rather than being exogenous or external shocks to the world system have been inherent in its very nature as it has evolved over the past millennium
1387934 officials committed what a dispassionate jury would recognize as a series of serious crimes under american law in the years after 2001
1387935 similar legal complaints against rumsfeld have been filed in countries like sweden and argentina german prosecutors dismissed a case in april saying it was up to the united states to investigate the issue
1387936 however there doesnt seem to me a social cost involved by prosecuting those who ran corporations and broke the law
1387937 recall some 1 billion are still living on 2 day income and its hard to make ends meet with such subsistence farming outputs in mainland china and india they are both destined to earn their living abroad as domestic engine of growth keeps on ticking by sheer force of inertia if not expanding sectoral investments and modernization in agri sector
1387938 my perspective is that asian emerging markets will find a solution for displaced subsistence farmers shld mechnaization of agri sector dislodge them from their farms

1387972 the idea was to take the letter to habbush and have him transcribe it in his own neat handwriting on a piece of iraqi government stationery to make it look legitimate cia would then take the finished product to baghdad and have someone release it to the media
1387973 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
1387974 the cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous

1387978 we found it surprising that out of body experiences during sleep transition seem very much like out of body experiences during near death
1387979 just before falling asleep or just after awakening have you had the sense that you are outside of your body and watching yourself
1387980 sleep paralysis is a common form of rem intrusion which can cause temporary paralysis along with visual or auditory hallucinations immediately after waking up or before falling asleep due to an ill timed disconnection between the brain and the body
1387981 the strong association of sleep paralysis with out of body experiences in the near death experience subject is curious and unexplained however persons with near death experiences appear to have an arousal system predisposed to both rem intrusion and out of body experiences
1387982 will irrevocably damage the universitys ability to fulfill its core mission
1387983 this reduction on top of the earlier 52 million cut from the general fund will make it impossible to fulfill that mission and could result in tens of thousands of students being turned away or closed out of courses needed for graduation
1387984 it is inconceivable that suny is being directed to absorb an overall cut of 148 million in anticipated state aid just weeks before classes are scheduled to resume

1387994 i don t think it s true i mean i think he is a friend of hers but i don t think about her private stuff and i don t believe what i read if she is not telling me about it it has very little value to me

1388000 the point isnt that private property is a bad thing or that the state should be able to run roughshod over the rights of individual owners
1388001 reason says one way to think about this problem is to think about what life would be like if every household owned the road in front of its house how would commerce work when people had to constantly pay fees for every step along the way
1388002 maybe but we would surely have to drive around expensive blocked or badly maintained stretches adding to any particular journey
1388003 but property rights need to be limited to be effective
1388004 highly unlikely roads are expensive to maintain without scale and not very profitable without scale either
1388005 most likely people would give up their sections of roads at a discount to some enterprising person

1388156 so what do you think of the fair so far
1388157 there aint no amusement park rides yet i cant buy elephant ears and cotton candy and candied apples and corn dogs thats boring
1388158 hey the fair folks said numerous times that the rides wouldnt be in place until monday afternoon
1388159 weve reported on that often in the ramp up to the fair
1388160 well we gave plenty of warning that there wouldnt be any carnival rides
1388161 all we got is these smelly old cows and pigs and sheep and goats
1388162 the fair is for entertainment of course but the original vision of the fair was to show off your animal husbandry and farming skills cheboygan county is one of the few fairs i have seen that keeps that concept as the forefront of the fair
1388163 thats why they got them old tractors out in the grandstand then
1388164 i sat around waiting for them to start crashing into each other but no luck they just pulled some kind of sled
1388165 yes the antique tractor pull isnt very popular with grandstand crowds
1388166 but the tractor and horse pulls are both vital aspects of the fairs original intent im glad the folks here keep them alive
1388167 well i for one cant wait to get on the rides that make my stomach go loopy
1388168 and if you ask me the grandstand is for fun stuff like the tough truck and bump and run
1388169 but if you take away all the traditional stuff all you have is a carnival

1388217 what would you do if your child were a homosexual
1388218 ignorance and misperceptions about homosexual relations have led to its association in peoples minds with perversion which is why many people dont consider that it has a place in armenian society
1388219 these people are not unclean but there is an impurity in them perhaps even from birth we recently wrote an email to a homosexual and asked him to bring himself closer to god and repent
1388220 the insulting thing was that they had separated his plate and cup from the rest and would not touch it but would come to him when they wanted to satisfy their sexual urges
1388221 you break off the head of the spoon smooth it out and push it in
1388222 i still cant imagine myself as a free man how should i know what im supposed to do when im released the world will definitely be different by then
1388223 the committee cannot know us well so its a matter of luck that someone gets a positive answer and someone else gets rejected its also insulting that the administration recommends your case but they dont take that into consideration
1388224 we have incidents now too but they are of a different kind for example we had an escape attempt in late august when a 31 year old convict jumped from a window on the fourth floor where the tuberculosis patients stay he jumped on to the guards tower where we have armed personnel and then on to the yard of the printing house next door from where he ran away naturally wed caught him by the next day it then turned out that he had had no particular reason to escape
1388225 when someone is ill his personality changes for the worse even if he was very nice when he was healthy he thinks that everyone should work at making things better for him even if it means breaking rules
1388226 the wives mothers and sisters of these people usually come to visit them sometimes only male relatives come to visit because the convicts dont want their women to set foot in this place

1388229 on one hand its a case of national security and there is great risk in considering whether someone who has been convicted 8 times and released early twice may finally have been rehabilitated our experience shows that they usually return 4 5 months later on the other hand there are some people who have definitely changed and are now trustworthy you can feel it
1388230 acceptance of qrxpharmas streamlined development plan for q8003ir is a measure of success in terms of reduced risk resource efficiencies and potential value of dual opioids we believe this outcome serves to reinforce the soundness of our business strategy to expand the clinical utility of existing compounds and deliver new treatments for targeted indications with well defined paths to regulatory approval and sales
1388231 no additional clinical studies or measures of safety and efficacy beyond those proposed by qrxpharma were requested
1388232 having successfully completed an initial phase 3 trial in april2008 qrxpharma continues to satisfy fda requirements and demonstrate the potential of q8003ir to provide equal or better analgesia with a reduction of total opioid dose and improved tolerability

1388257 it was the instruments that brought us together we never really sat down and decided to form a group
1388258 recounts zakar one of the founding members of the group synkope
1388259 theyd ask me what type of music do we play and id tell them a mixed bag of stuff
1388260 our playing still hasnt reached a professional level so sometimes we cant convey what wed like to but were working on it were slowly on the way up especially since the addition of anna a graduate of the jazz college as vocalist and artur another jazz college grad as percussionist

1388267 in 1999 my friend armen who now lives in los angeles laid down two guitar rhythms on tape at the hay fm studio and took off
1388268 my friend left and i continued on with the songs
1388269 says aramazd he adds that he adopted the name of the supreme god in the armenian mythological pantheon when his songs first appeared on the internet
1388270 the underlying rationale of aramazd is to convey through music the totality of moral concepts and conception of the universe that armenians of old adhered to
1388271 says aramazd and adds that pagan black metal serves as his stylistic underpinnings
1388272 id like to be better known but ive never thought about going commercial

1388292 when a political party is created the cuban christian democratic party that i founded with four others i present the political party to the interests section
1388293 charles o blaha recommends to her that she interview me and from that recommendation which are very special recommendations because supposedly these people have studied you theyve characterized you and they know you when robin diane meyer arrives in cuba she considers me practically one of them
1388294 but one person who stood out for me the most who was a member of this committee was porter goss who a few years later was the director of the cia
1388295 a whole series of individuals who have a past that is closely linked to the secret services of the united states
1388296 from then on she began to give me special treatment within that special treatment that she gives me she suggests that i write to frank calz n she says that there is a group of non governmental organizations foundations that are eager to help the dissident movement in cuba and to that end she places in my hands the resource guide for the transition in cuba
1388297 this lady a cia officer a very good friend of mine was the one who put me in contact with frank calz n
1388298 and i very prudently as i go by the instructions of state security write the letter and i ask him for medicine and literature about human rights and then i give her the letter and she tells me lets send it here at the interests section through the fax at the interests section
1388299 she had already given me the number the book were talking about frank calz n was then the director of the free cuba program of freedom house he had recently received 500 000 from president clinton to achieve the transition of cuba translated into spanish for the defeat of the revolution
1388300 i carried that letter to the interests section and the curious thing about it was that they didnt send it instead a few weeks later frank calz n calls me at home my number is not listed in havana in other words evidently there was a link between robin meyer and frank calz n
1388301 very good so good that i used to call him each sunday at two in the afternoon at his home every sunday
1388302 frank calz n would send me money twice a year a lot of money
1388303 they wanted to know precisely who the director was and what kinds of services they offered
1388304 he explained to me that the north american government thought that carlos lage could be fidel castros replacement
1388305 i had to take the photographs at the request of frank calz n
1388306 frank calz n was the one who had sent robert kent to cuba he had financed the trip
1388307 besides that he had brought 500 from calz n to give to me but kent felt so comfortable with me that instead of giving me 500 he gave me 700 to buy myself a motorbike
1388308 curiously robert kent asks for the same sensitive information that meyer was asking me for petroleum deposits and servimed
1388309 the cuban libraries project began in october 1998 and four months later kent came to cuba but he didnt bring any books
1388310 there was only one independent library in las tunas and kent didnt go to las tunas

1388424 now listen you two theres a certain rumor that cant be true that man descends from our noble race the very idea its a dire disgrace no monkey ever deserted his wife starved her baby and ruined her life and youve never known a mother monk to leave her babies with others to bunk and another thing youll never see a monk build a fence around a coconut tree and let the cocoanuts go to waste forbidding all the other monks a taste heres another thing a monk wont do go out at night and get in a stew or use a gun or club or knife to take some other monkeys life yes man descends the ornery cuss but brother he didnt descend from us
1388425 there are some people who might try to deride this trip as a photo opportunity
1388426 we wholeheartedly disagree this is an opportunity for the president to meet with his commander on the ground and his ambassador on the ground and he will be able to look prime minister nouri maliki in the eye and talk with him about the progress that is starting to happen in iraq what we hope to see and the challenges that remain
1388427 the mass exodus and internal displacement of people have been brought on by escalating sectarian conflict combined with the presence of foreign troops united nations refugee agency spokesperson as saying that massive displacement of iraqis internally and externally continues unabated causing a great deal of suffering and uncertainty estimates put the number of people fleeing the violence at 2 000 daily
1388428 war is a racket it always has been it is possibly the oldest easily the most profitable surely the most vicious it is the only one international in scope it is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives
1388429 deaths are down 55 55 of what and since when and where
1388430 i am not truly free if i am taking away someone elses freedom just as surely as i am not free when my freedom is taken from me for to be free is not merely to cast off ones chains but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others the true test of devotion to freedom is just beginning
1388431 to be alive is to be on fire with purpose to move forward with undaunted determination toward a goal many people think great things but do not act on them however it is the activity that creates the greatness
1388432 good travels at a snails pace those who want to do good are not selfish they are not in a hurry they know that to impregnate people with good requires a long time the trial of ones conviction is just beginning greatness in contribution requires action doing the good requires selflessness and patience
1388433 this was the week in which americans hoped they would get straight talk and clear thinking on iraq
1388434 during the war between the states an elderly lady rebuked lincoln for speaking kinds words for the south
1388435 near the close of the civil war some wounded soldiers of the confederacy were kept prisoners at city point among themselves they discussed bitterly the man whom they believed had brought on the war of rebellion one day mr lincoln came to city point he went among the soldiers of the northern army and did not forget the rebel soldiers being cared for in the ward near by after lincoln had departed one of the rebel soldiers sat up in bed exclaiming is that the kind of man we have been fighting against for four years why he even recognized a rebel and treated him as well as any of his own if god spares my life i will never again raise my arms against the united states government
1388436 essentially this is an issue of a departure from our very exacting standards
1388437 the air force maintains the highest standards of safety and precision so any deviation from these well established munitions procedures is very serious and we are responding swiftly
1388438 for mahatma gandhi the dandi march was not just a non violent weapon of struggle it was also a means of dialogue and communication with people along the route gandhis dialogue with a nation
1388439 it was the mothers who suffered to bring these boys into the world who cared for them in sickness and health and it was our flesh and blood that enriched the foreign soil can you picture the anxiety of these mothers watching at the door for the postman every day for the little letter that was to come from her boy and the agony and suspense when those letters stopped and then only to be replaced with a telegram from washington informing her that her boy was wounded or missing or dead
1388440 diversity was once just another word now its a fighting word one of the biggest problems with diversity is that it wont let you alone
1388441 if the researchers in europe and the u s are correct plant subconscious seeds of social behavior that can be manipulated
1388442 this fear can show up anywhere in your workplace in your neighborhood in your place of worship no group is immune it is so sad because rather than appreciating all the advantages that diversity can bring they choose instead to sing the siren song of homogeneity to rally around mirror images of themselves and let their fear manifest itself as hate
1388443 the basic idea beneath diversity emerged about 2000 years ago under two rubrics love thy neighbor as thyself and do unto others as they would do unto you
1388444 may i do to others as i would that they should do unto me
1388445 love your enemies do good to those that hate you luke 6 27
1388446 whosoever of you sees an evil action let him change it with his hand and if he is not able to do so then with his tongue and if he is not able to do so then with his heart
1388447 none of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself
1388448 regard your neighbors gain as your own gain and your neighbors loss as your own loss
1388449 do not do to others that which would anger you if others did it to you
1388450 surely it is the maxim of loving kindness do not unto others that your would not have them do unto you
1388451 this is the sum of duty do naught unto others which would cause you pain if done to you
1388452 that nature alone is good which refrains from doing unto another whatsoever is not good for itself
1388453 if it is to be it is up to me
1388454 this marks a historic moment when member states and indigenous peoples have reconciled with their painful histories
1388455 if we do not act we shall surely be dragged down the long dark and shameful corridors of time reserved for those who possess power without compassion might without morality and strength without sight
1388456 the golden rule is to resolutely refuse to have what millions cannot this ability to refuse will not descend upon us all of a sudden the first thing is to cultivate the mental attitude that will not have possessions or facilities denied to millions and the next immediate thing is to rearrange our lives as fast as possible in accordance with that mentality
1388457 this marks a historic moment when member states and indigenous peoples have reconciled with their painful histories
1388458 major step forward towards the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all
1388459 if a few states do not accept the declaration then it would be a reflection on them rather than the document
1388460 it is subject to interpretation but we can work with this
1388461 the 13th of september 2007 will be remembered as an international human rights day for the indigenous peoples of the world
1388462 we are really very happy and thrilled to hear about the adoption of the declaration
1388463 it recognizes that governments can no longer treat us as second class citizens and it gives protection to tribal peoples so that they will not be thrown off their lands like we were
1388464 it sets a benchmark by which the treatment of tribal and indigenous peoples can be judged and we hope it will usher in an era in which abuse of their rights is no longer tolerated
1388465 will signal a major shift in the landscape of international human rights law in which the collective rights of indigenous peoples will finally be recognized and defended
1388466 it will be the test of commitment of states and the whole international community to protect respect and fulfill indigenous peoples collective and individual human rights
1388467 i call on governments the un system indigenous peoples and civil society at large to rise to the historic task before us and make the un declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples a living document for the common future of humanity
1388468 canada has shown its true colors on our human rights
1388469 the entire wealth of the united states canada and other so called modern states is built on the poverty and human rights violations of their indigenous peoples
1388470 the international community needs to understand how hypocritical canada australia new zealand and the united states are
1388471 how wonderful if politicians could bring themselves to admit they are only fallible human creatures and not god and thus by definition can make mistakes unfortunately they seem to think that such an admission is a sign of weakness weak and insecure people hardly ever say sorry
1388472 it is large hearted and courageous people who are not diminished by saying i made a mistake
1388473 jesus said forgive and you will be forgiven what he didnt say is you are forgiven and now you try to forgive others
1388474 life will continue to give us the same experiences or situations until we decided to learn the true essence of the experience or situation all experiences are labeled as either good or bad by us but the true reality is that the experience is just a learning experience the past is dead and will only live again in our minds so move forward with a clean slate and give yourself all the love you deserve as newborn babies we were all gifted with a beautiful heart
1388475 never look back move right ahead even when youre quaking god is always on the road ahead
1388476 pure fantasy an attempt to entice people to sign away their rights
1388477 driving on the right side of the road or car
1388478 penerjemahan itu bukan pengalihan kata karena itu saya tidak setuju dengan istilah mengalihbahasakan menerjemahkan itu menyampaikan kembali dalam bahasa lain hal itu luas aspeknya tidak hanya menerjemahkan kata kata saja tetapi juga suasana dan nuansanya jadi ini merupakan pekerjaan yang membutuhkan rasa seni juga
1388479 kadang kadang ada penerjemah yang menguasai bahasa asalnya tapi konteks zaman atau peristiwa sejarahnya kurang dikuasai akibatnya kendati bahasanya asal dikuasai betul dalam proses menerjemahkan ke dalam bahasa indonesia bisa menjadi tidak tepat ini karena mereka tidak menguasai konteks zaman historis maupun kondisi sosialnya
1388480 penguasaan bahasa sasaran atau dalam hal ini bahasa indonesia menurut saya justru lebih penting daripada penguasaan bahasa asal atau sumber
1388481 mungkin mereka menguasai benar bahasa inggrisnya tapi bahasa indonesianya justru tidak nah ini justru berbahaya sekali
1388482 bahasa sasaran itu lebih penting daripada bahasa asal kalau bahasa asal kita enggak tahu kita bisa buka kamus tanya teman atau cari di internet tapi kalau kosakata kita terbatas pengetahuan tentang susunan kalimat atau gramatik kita juga terbatas dengan sendirinya hasilnya juga enggak baik kurang variatif bahkan enggak bunyi
1388483 bagaimanapun penguasaan bahasa sasaran memang harus lebih dikuasai oleh seorang penerjemah memang ada lost and gain nya kalau bahasa sasaran dikuasai dengan baik tetapi jika bahasa sumbernya tidak dikuasai dengan baik tetap menjadi masalah akan tetapi persoalan ini bisa diatasi asalkan penerjemahnya rajin artinya dia bisa tanya orang atau cari di kamus kalau bahasa sasaran yang tidak dikuasai hal ini bisa menjadi persoalan besar karena ada kecenderungan kalau kita sudah merasa pintar berbahasa indonesia sehingga tidak ada lagi dorongan untuk rajin atau bertanya bahkan membuka yang namanya kbbi kamus besar bahasa indonesia gejala seperti ini sangat terlihat jelas akhir akhir ini terutama dengan buku buku terbitan jogja kovernya bagus bagus kelihatannya menarik orang menjadi terpukau untuk beli akan tetapi begitu melihat terjemahannya waduh orang orang yang mengaku kenal gramsci mengenal foucault tapi ternyata ketika sampai ke dalam bahasa indonesia menjadi sama sekali tidak bisa dikenali
1388484 buku nonfiksi seperti karya ilmiah misalnya terjemahannya enggak boleh melenceng sama sekali dengan aslinya kalau bisa setiap kata ada padanannya dalam bahasa indonesia nah kalau hasilnya menjadi tidak terbaca itu masalah lain lagi tapi bagaimanapun terjemahan yang baik itu tetap yang bisa dibaca
1388485 dalam menerjemahkan karya nonfiksi seperti pengetahuan umum misalnya saya tidak melihat sejauh mana dia penerjemah mampu mempertahankan bentuk yang asli tetapi yang lebih penting adalah sejauh mana dia bisa menyampaikan maknanya kepada pembaca indonesia selama makna terseberangkan hilangnya beberapa detail bahkan kalau perlu dengan merombak struktur kalimat yang kompleks menjadi simpel enggak apa apa karena penerjemahan nonfiksi itu biasanya bersifat memberi tahu orang tentang sesuatu atau bagaimana cara melakukan sesuatu nah dengan demikian yang lebih penting adalah kemampuan untuk menyeberangkan gagasan utamanya makna tersampaikan dengan baik dan tidak ada kesalahpahaman
1388486 mereka disebut sebagai pengkhianat kreatif karena dalam menerjemahkan karya sastra mereka melakukan kreativitasisasi tapi mengkhianati teksasinya
1388487 dalam beberapa hal saya lebih berpihak kepada penerjemah yang melakukan usaha usaha kontekstualisasi karena dengan kontekstualisasi teks tersebut bisa bermakna bagi pembacanya oleh karena itu ketika karya karya ernest hemingway diterjemahkan ke dalam bahasa indonesia saya berkeyakinan bahwa sampai saat ini karya itu belum bisa diterima oleh banyak orang
1388488 sapardi djoko damono pernah menerjemahkan puisi puisi klasik cina hasilnya bagus tetapi bentuk asli sama sekali ditinggalkan sehingga bisa saja orang tidak tahu kalau itu puisi klasik cina orang akan sangat mudah mengasumsikan itu sebagai puisinya sapardi
1388489 dampak dari kehadiran karya karya terjemahan akhir akhir ini luar biasa bagi perkembangan kesusastraan indonesia karena ada semacam asumsi ketika di suatu bangsa kesusastraan bangsa itu sedang stagnan tidak ada fenomena besar yang muncul maka yang membuat kesusastraan bangsa itu tetap hidup adalah karya karya terjemahan sebagaimana pun kualitasnya nah kalau kemudian muncul misalnya ayu utami dewi lestari dan sebagainya terus orang indonesia sendiri tercambuk untuk menghasilkan sesuatu yang berbeda sebagai akibat banyaknya novel terjemahan memang harus dilihat lagi akan tetapi kesan stagnasi kira kira sepuluh tahun lalu sekarang sudah mulai berubah orangnya tidak itu itu terus putu wijaya putu wijaya terus sekarang ada yang sedikit berubah ketika muncul ayu utami
1388490 transformasi struktural dan transformasi fundamental butuh sesuatu yang disebut titik balik

1388511 one of the more depressing aspects of blogging and the modern world is seeing reams of text on a page the thunder dragons mixture of politics and fun posts with good illustrations and quickly made points makes his blog an accessible and fun place to discuss and think about politics the thunderdragon is one of the rising stars of conservative blogging
1388512 already an a lister technical whiz thunder dragon shows that not all a listers are stuck up stats groupies whod sell their grandmothers for more traffic and hes on iain dales list for a reason hes simply a fine blogger scoring highly on the ten point dale criteria and with his finger always on the political pulse hes also the technical brains behind blogpower along with ian at imagined community
1388513 the thunderdragon consistently provides an interesting and enjoyable read always entertaining and often insightful his writing may even give us a foretaste of our political future stick with him after all time will cure his youth

1388521 home based businesses are one of the fastest growing segments in our economy and that trend will only continue as the age of the corporation now gives way to the age of the entrepreneur

1388529 mary kate had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1388530 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1388531 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate

1388550 our hypothesis was that certain non toxic dietary agents that had the ability to promote reactive oxygen species ros would break down pancreatic cancer cell resistance to therapy following administration of mda 7 il 24 and be safe for human use
1388551 we are very excited at the prospect of this chemoprevention gene therapy as a means of both preventing and treating pancreatic cancer and it has significant potential to move rapidly into human clinical trials
1388552 foreigner became synonymous with enemy there was all this animosity directed towards any foreigner and at the same time there was an extraordinary outpouring of brotherly love within america we had this paradox that 9 11 led to intergroup harmony inside the united states while leading to intergroup conflict outside the united states
1388553 to the best of our knowledge this line of research is the first to document these relationships
1388554 our initial studies conducted during the week of the six month anniversary of 9 11 had americans read a u s senators policy on intergroup relations during this period of national challenge americans endorsed multiculturalism more as a domestic policy and assimilation more as a foreign policy
1388555 most recently we discovered that americans primed with 9 11 a foreign threat revealed higher levels of national identity than those primed with the columbine massacre a domestic threat
1388556 during a period of national challenge embracing ones national identity can be highly adaptive
1388557 the healing power of embracing ones national identity was obvious among the 78 percent of americans who indicated in 2002 that 9 11 and its aftermath has changed america for the better perhaps the greatest tragedy of all is that calamity can unite people in a way that shared humanity cannot
1388558 the last 10 to 15 years have seen particularly dangerous declines in rainfall in sensitive ecosystems in east africa such as somalia and eastern ethiopia
1388559 we wanted to know if the trend would continue or if it would start getting wetter
1388560 we can be quite certain that the decline in rainfall has been substantial and will continue to be
1388561 this 15 percent decrease every 20 25 years is likely to continue
1388562 a strong commitment to agricultural development by both african nations and the international community could lead fairly quickly to a more food secure africa
1388563 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1388564 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1388565 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1388566 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1388567 we hope that these results will speed up the classification of the ntokou pikounda zone into a protected area
1388568 they tell us that the landscape has changed very little in 14 1 million years and that at the time the fossils lived the climate in this sector of antarctica was similar to that of southern south america today the organisms died out suddenly by 13 9 million years ago and since that time interior antarctica has been in a perpetual deep freeze with most of the interior ice remaining relatively stable and frozen the exact cause of this dramatic climatic shift one of the most significant over the last 65 million years remains unknown
1388569 mid miocene cooling and the extinction of tundra in continental antarctica
1388570 in addition to fossils of organisms that inhabited the lake we have recovered pollen and spores and a few macroscopic remains of plants and insects that inhabited the lake regions
1388571 everything about the fossil site from its geology to the fossils themselves tells us the climate shift was abrupt major and enduring its legacy continues to this day
1388572 what people dont realize is these medications can pose a host of side effects including daytime drowsiness even bizarre behavior like sleep walking sleep eating and sleep driving there are alternative treatments such as sound machines that may be quite effective yet pose no risks at all
1388573 this study demonstrates how remedial instruction can use the plasticity of the human brain to gain an educational improvement
1388574 focused instruction can help underperforming brain areas to increase their proficiency
1388575 any kind of education is a matter of training the brain when poor readers are learning to read a particular brain area is not performing as well as it might and remedial instruction helps to shape that area up
1388576 this finding shows that poor readers can be helped to develop buff brains a similar approach should apply to other skills
1388577 we are at the beginning of a new era of neuro education
1388578 while adolescent african american females remain a high risk group for stds little research has examined their marijuana use sexual behaviors and incidence of std infection
1388579 although no differences in condom use were identified between marijuana users and non users results suggest that marijuana users are engaging in sexual acts with riskier partners and under riskier circumstances and had higher rates of stds
1388580 to me the most interesting part of the whole story is that weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate the transition marks a shift from warm temperate glaciers with patches of fringing tundra to todays cold polar glaciers set within in a barren polar desert
1388581 the contrast couldnt be more striking it is like comparing tierra del fuego today with the surface of mars and this transition took place over a geologically short interval of roughly 200 000 years
1388582 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1388583 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
1388584 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past on land there are very few places on earth that contain sediment of this age and none are as well preserved as those found in the dry valleys
1388585 the sediments allow reconstructions of alpine glaciers tundra and lakes all in remarkable detail to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1388586 is the last hint of vegetation in the dry valleys
1388587 the fossil finds and dating of volcanic ash show that roughly 14
1388588 and its within these ancient lake beds that we found the fossils
1388589 lewis marchant and ashworth discovered the last bit of life on the antarctic continent it was hanging on by its fingernails just a few simple plants and bugs in a small pond everything else around them frozen over and then wham they went too and it must have happened quickly because these fossils are literally freeze dried when i visited the scientists in the field they showed me how the moss was still green and leafy
1388590 it is one of the most dramatic and long lasting changes that one can imagine
1388591 i dont know of any other place on earth where such an enduring change has been documented the fact that it is associated with the extinction of tundra plants and insects helps provide quantitative estimates for the magnitude of this change
1388592 other scientists had been to this area before but hadnt noticed anything unusual it took the trained eye of this team to make the discovery
1388593 it is hard to diagnose the anemia of chronic disease
1388594 having an assay for hepcidin would make it much easier and it would also help in diagnosing iron overload diseases
1388595 it will allow the diagnosis of underlying inflammation to distinguish diseases of iron metabolism that stem from hepcidin versus those with other causes
1388596 it can help us divine the effects of inflammation on body iron stores
1388597 its hard to distinguish globular clusters from stars and galaxies using ground based telescopes
1388598 with hubble we were able to identify and study about 90 percent of the globular clusters in all our observed fields this was crucial for dwarf galaxies that have only a handful of star clusters
1388599 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1388600 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded centre contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1388601 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from messier 87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1388602 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of messier 87
1388603 in messier 87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1388604 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1388605 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1388606 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters centre messier 87 sits at the centre of a large concentration of dark matter and all of these globulars near the centre probably formed early in the history of the virgo cluster
1388607 star formation farther away from the central region was not as robust which may have produced only less massive star clusters that dissipated over time
1388608 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1388609 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1388610 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1388611 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1388612 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1388613 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
1388614 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1388615 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1388616 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1388617 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1388618 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
1388619 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1388620 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
1388621 analysis of the available data provides unequivocal support for endovascular repair to replace open surgery as the procedure of choice for repair of the most common traumatic aortic injury
1388622 this minimally invasive interventional radiology technique can decrease the death rate by half and diminish the risk of paraplegia by 75 percent as compared to open surgical repair
1388623 may be a result of the decreased systemic stress that endovascular repair affords
1388624 this study provides another indication of the tremendous innovation in the development of new devices and techniques that interventional radiology continues to offer

1388634 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1388635 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1388636 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1388637 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1388638 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1388639 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1388640 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1388641 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1388642 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1388643 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner

1388694 the latest index signalled a contraction of private sector output for the second month running
1388695 the rate of decline accelerating to the fastest since november 2001
1388696 the fall has left the annual rate at a record low of 3 1 percent clearly the slowdown underway in the eurozone economy is related to domestic spending and not just external demand
1388697 it looks as though consumer spending could have knocked around 0 3 percentage points off quarterly gdp growth with other components of growth also likely to have slowed there is a risk that gdp fell in the second quarter given that the surveys point to a fall in the third quarter too recession risks are mounting
1388698 forward looking indicators notably the accelerating rate of loss of new business and reduction in employment paint a bleak outlook for the rest of the quarter and raise the possibility that the eurozone will endure a technical recession
1388699 but with output price inflation picking up again it looks like the ecb will remain focused on upward inflation risks
1388700 the marked fall in retail sales in june and sharper contraction in service sector activity in july according to the purchasing managers survey add to the mounting evidence that the eurozone economic downturn is deepening

1388733 from the early 1930s until the mid 1980s the percentage of churches aggregate undesignated receipts given through cp was consistently in the 10 5 to 11 percent range but in 1984 while the total dollars continued to grow reaching 522 million in 2005 and the percentage of churches giving through cp remained remarkably high at 95 percent the average portion that churches contributed began to sharply decline from 10 6 percent in 1984 to 6 99 percent in 2004
1388734 in a survey of southern baptists of texas convention churches responding to the annual church profile the texan found that congregations with fewer than 1 000 resident members averaged 7 4 percent in the amount of undesignated receipts set aside for the cooperative program nearly a percentage point higher than the norm for all sbc churches a decline occurs with a 6 7 percent average for churches in the 3 000 to 3 999 range 4 3 percent for those between 4 000 and 4 999 and 3 75 percent between 5 000 and 9 999 members once over 10 000 resident members the cp average falls to near 1 percent the overall average among sbtc churches analyzed is 7 percent in some cases churches have moved from a budgeted cp percentage preferring a lump sum instead as the church grows that line item isnt likely to grow with it
1388735 a big church where i can make social and business connections
1388736 many churches seem to assume they give generously through cp when tens of thousands of dollars are raised annually for the seasonal lottie moon christmas and annie armstrong easter offerings but those are designated gifts limited to funding mission endeavors of the international mission board and north american mission board when churches prioritize mission offerings to the neglect of cp other sbc ministries take a hit including six theological seminaries where ministers are trained the ethics amp religious liberty commission and relief for ministers widows one participant in a texan survey of cp and missions giving indicated cp support at a level four times what acp figures reported the church gave most likely the church included seasonal offerings as cp funding
1388737 during the imb pastor missions leader conference i was stunned by the following information 2006
1388738 when some messengers to the greensboro meeting bristled at the original language encouraging churches to give at least 10 percent of their receipts to support world evangelization through the cooperative program others questioned what message is being delivered when sbc presidents typically come from churches with poor levels of cp support
1388739 the question for me was does your church give sacrificially to the cooperative program does it give in such a way as to show a missional mindset

1388784 you shouldnt have any difficulty making a criminal referral to the department of justice to commence a criminal investigation of the bush administration to determine whether first degree murder charges should be brought against certain members of this administration and i hereby strongly urge you to do so
1388785 whether republican or democrat all americans should be absolutely outraged over what the bush administration has done how dare they do what they did how dare they
1388786 believe it or not i do not say in this book where i am asking george w bush to be prosecuted for murder that he lied about weapons of mass destruction actually he did lie about weapons of mass destruction but that is not why im saying that he should be prosecuted for murder
1388787 weve been talking to our company about regulatory compliance concerning the boarding of liquids on this aircraft i had to know exactly for sure what i was talking about before i gave you any sort of announcement i dont want to cause undue alarm about this it is not a threat against the aircraft you really have nothing to be concerned about safety wise right now where we stand we are talking to tsa right now theyre the ones that kinda make the decision on what happens with this whether or not we are in fact allowed to take off at this point ill be honest with you were about 50 50 whether were gonna go back to the gate and have to do a re screening or we can leave that decision is being figured out right now
1388788 we are still waiting word just trying to keep you up to date with as much as i know and right now we do not have word this has gone on to tsa they are not known for being particularly fast with their decisions so thats whats going on
1388789 bush our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity is finally over washington dc mere days from assuming the presidency and closing the door on eight years of bill clinton president elect george w
1388790 our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity is finally over
1388791 at long last we have reached the end of the dark period in american history that will come to be known as the clinton era eight long years characterized by unprecedented economic expansion a sharp decrease in crime and sustained peace overseas the time has come to put all of that behind us
1388792 you better believe were going to mix it up with somebody at some point during my administration
1388793 unlike my predecessor i am fully committed to putting soldiers in battle situations otherwise what is the point of even having a military
1388794 finally the horrific misrule of the democrats has been brought to a close
1388795 under bush we can all look forward to military aggression deregulation of dangerous greedy industries and the defunding of vital domestic social service programs upon which millions depend mercifully we can now say goodbye to the awful nightmare that was clintons america
1388796 for years i tirelessly preached the message that clinton must be stopped
1388797 and yet in 1996 the american public failed to heed my urgent warnings re electing clinton despite the fact that the nation was prosperous and at peace under his regime but now thank god thats all done with once again we will enjoy mounting debt jingoism nuclear paranoia mass deficit and a massive military build up
1388798 in the year 2000 when president bush was a candidate he said many times in debate he would bring dignity to the white house this would be a great start if karl rove would come before the judiciary committee and let him explain his involvement if any in the don siegelman case
1388799 to me the middle east is about young people and if we fail to create opportunities for them then youre going to see a lot of frustrated hope
1388800 oh yeah yeah yeah hes a state isnt that great
1388801 i think that the major difference that everyone has noted compared to other wto meetings is that china has been included in the main core of the negotiations
1388802 this is an important change because china is a very specific country that doesnt really need this deal to improve its trade balance or to benefit more from trade
1388803 china has been under a lot of pressure from the u s to become more engaged in these negotiations

1388818 being here is great but this wasnt the real show

1388821 i dont think there has every been a game when we played australia when it wasnt physical
1388822 ive been to three olympics games and this diamond ball is by far the best in terms of preparation
1388823 everyone has their full teams and the top three teams in the world are here its a great lead up to the olympics
1388824 security for the olympic games is of paramount importance the more we give the safer and more secure the residents will feel

1388826 its more a hindrance than major flaw at this point three years ago a team of ilab engineers
1388827 in a contact center space its difficult to predict spikes in the network that are unforeseen
1388828 after at amp t launches the 3g iphone for instance who knows what that will bring to our call centers the sip world has not fully matured yet to handle that kind of flux in traffic
1388829 everyone understands how tdm works but in the sip environment there has to be some more effort to get people to understand how it operates
1388830 previously a lot of people would experience problems because of a lack of standards but that was a few years back
1388831 when it comes down to it unless youre doing something really bizarre and funky with your implementation you wont have many problems
1388832 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1388833 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services

1388836 we did a lot of cosmetic stuff that doesnt cost a ton of money
1388837 the jury said they appreciated seeing a sensitive renovation to a rambler
1388838 usually they see massive remodeling with so much changed or added
1388839 people here dont like them but they transform easily and lend themselves to todays lives
1388840 people were coming in and walking right out it desperately needed renovation
1388841 i hate finding a house that somebodys already messed with
1388842 i am drawn to the 50s i collect a lot of antiques from the period that was an important time in american design with explosive creativity
1388843 it has a really open floor plan which was unusual then
1388844 the original owner was an alderman who used to have public meetings down there and the knotty pine paneling was perfectly preserved most people would paint it or cover it up but we knew we had to keep it
1388845 thats a green design strategy if you take them off what does that get you spending money on air conditioning
1388846 i think what you have here is the gambino crime family reaching out to tampa fla
1388847 they tried very hard to convict him up here they spared no resources and it didnt work
1388848 its tragic for him and his family to have to continually go through this its almost laughable

1388853 in the past year weve taken in animals from as far afield as dorset lancashire cheshire shropshire and worcestershire
1388854 we also took in 30 cats from a couple in south wales after their house was repossessed
1388855 we have also taken animals from four small holdings in ceredigion denbighshire snowdonia and cheshire after they were repossessed
1388856 theres no question the rise in the number of animals we are dealing with is down to the credit crunch the situation is in crisis
1388857 roughly speaking were taking in about three animals a day and we now have 400 cats and 20 dogs
1388858 we have not seen a rise in abandoned pets specifically linked to the credit crunch

1388863 a great deal of misinformation has ensued since i sent a straightforward letter last week to the citys inspector general asking how he would like to have me address public records requests for information that may be privileged and thus not eligible for release to other parties as a result of his investigation
1388864 to be clear the intent of the letter was to offer my cooperation not to make demands of inspector general robert cerasoli my letter was a courtesy to the inspector generals office inquiring as to whether he would like the records to remain confidential or not if his preference is for records to remain confidential i need to be clear that in order for my office to accommodate this position for future investigations i would need to be advised of such investigations
1388865 it would be helpful if in the future you would provide a direct communication to my office when you initiate an investigation and would request that records are not released until further notice
1388866 communicating to the citys law department its intention to initiate an investigation would be inconsistent with the offices role and statutory responsibilities and accordingly we will not do so
1388867 the legal rules applicable to the conduct of this offices investigations do not alter the publics right of access to public information or your legal and ethical responsibility to provide access
1388868 ive had a good life ive got a lot of good friends and a lot of support

1388876 keeping on top of legislative and regulatory requirements is a critical responsibility made more difficult because compliance efforts are still operating in project mode and have not yet been embedded into business processes
1388877 it projects still lack alignment with business objectives at many organizations and as a result they are unable to realize business benefits
1388878 we are excited to be national leaders in this key sustainability effort

1388883 senator obamas stance on offshore oil drilling has been mischaracterized he has not changed his position he has continually campaigned against additional drilling calling the policy a gimmick saying it was a scheme and ridiculing those who support it with his steadfast opposition to john mccains all of the above approach to our energy crisis americans should know that barack obama remains opposed to additional domestic oil drilling speaker pelosi moveon org and the sierra club can take comfort from the fact that barack obama still opposes additional domestic oil drilling meanwhile the american people can be sure that john mccain will do what is necessary to reduce this countrys dependence on middle east oil and bring down prices at the pump

1388898 for 100 more you could pick up an xbox 360 with tv and movie downloads direct to the console no pc required oh yeah you can do a bunch of other stuff too the second issue i have is that apple continues to lock us into their ecosystem a model that has worked well for them with audio but may not be as successful with video in the era of youtube and divx the itv has limited multimedia format support compared to products such as netgears new digital entertainer hd
1388899 this thing sucks and im not just saying that because im a media center user it just doesnt do much of anything that cant already be done with other products that have been out for years why cache on the hdd is your network not fast enough with 802 11n to get that done no pvr functionality tops out at 720p other than mac support i dont think this offers anything new sure its really the first device to play video purchased from itunes but thats about it
1388900 you can add other plain quicktime movies into your itunes library though but this is still very limited
1388901 if you want a more universal solution then the xbox 360
1388902 there was a lot of hype that the codenamed apple itv would revolutionize the tv industry

1388904 do not have to bear the full costs of research and development for the software
1388905 in recent years certain open source software business models have evolved into a growing challenge to our license based software model
1388906 the availability of protocol licenses may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of microsofts own products which could result in a reduction in sales of our products
1388907 microsoft released the sharepoint protocol as part of its compliance with the european commissions decision issued on march 24 2004
1388908 the popularization of the open source software model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model including continuing efforts by proponents of open source software to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products
1388909 stop wasting money paying tiger woods to endorse a brand that the demographic tiger appeals to wouldnt be caught dead in
1388910 a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage
1388911 theres a real irony when it comes to offshore drilling its done so we can get more oil in the hopes of reducing gas prices in the meantime we keep burning fossil fuels which causes more global warming which leads to more hurricanes which lead to more oil lost in spills and yet drilling does almost nothing to alleviate the cost of gasoline
1388912 government studies have indicated that it will take a decade for any offshore drilling to pay off even minimally and even then prices will only be reduced by a few cents per gallon
1388913 important to recognise if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for 10 years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices every expert agrees on that
1388914 the reality is we will have a new president in three months and what bush and the republicans are trying to do amounts to a land grab for the oil companies
1388915 i dont think we have to give in at all pre election we have many more options postelection
1388916 my view is that if we have a vote lets make it a rational policy
1388917 we cant let republicans hold this issue hostage because of one vote
1388918 the current debate seems to be bogged down in partisan one upmanship
1388919 its grossly unfair to the democrats who want a vote
1388920 this is a not a new issue this just didnt happen today weve been working on this for months
1388921 there is no crisis on our side of the aisle

1388927 we as offensive linemen are going to play injured but you want to go fresh into the season starting off with some pretty serious surgery and a pulled hamstring isnt the best way of doing it im confident i will be ready but im nervous
1388928 its one of those things where i probably played with it the whole first half crawford said
1388929 im just trying to find a way to beat it its probably just better to rest it its sore its strained every time i take a step it feels like its about to pull hopefully it will get better soon
1388930 foster was laughing because i was going for the wrong person
1388931 but no it was all good that made practice a little more fun it wasnt anything too serious a little bit of pushing
1388932 nobody wants to be embarrassed so its good to see we didnt give any pep talks or anything like that
1388933 all we talked about was this is a normal practice its not a scrimmage format
1388934 we want you to come out like you do every day in practice and come out with the same tempo it was just interesting to see our guys respond and get competitive in different environments
1388935 it was a lot more productive than i thought it was going to be
1388936 i thought peoples tempers would be flying but they really werent it was good it was a good practice i got a lot out of it everybody did it was a good tempo
1388937 no one could have saw that coming and i couldnt ask for it better
1388938 when i heard coach harbaugh was here and had the opportunity to transfer to stanford i dont care michigan was my dream school but that puts a smile on your face

1388945 im willing to admit that ive been going through a very bad time with depression
1388946 im more concerned to see just to push him as hard as we can make him work as long as hes physically ready to go
1388947 from a training room standpoint we need to continue to push him im not into the whole well when the lights go on they play well thats not my deal im trying to work him out of that mentality
1388948 you saw him ready to come out against another team
1388949 as we continue to learn javon he had kind of a different look today at the beginning of practice than our normal practices because he was more competitive to go against somebody else were going to continue to try to build that mentality in him thats how we want him to be at every practice not just because were going to play somebody else
1388950 my refuge obviously is just talking to friends being around friends being around new people doing other things besides everything that happens off the field
1388951 i live a very very simple life on the field thats a blessing a lot of people cant do what we normally come out here to do so i just take full advantage of the opportunity that i have and being able to play this game
1388952 he came out with an emphasis just to be himself just do his thing the right way
1388953 if they try to stick a safety or a linebacker on me im going to run right by them davis said

1388959 hes physical and he uses his speed we werent expecting a lot of him and all of a sudden hes doing pretty good martz said

1388965 ive always been a trivial pursuit fan and i can really see tv audiences becoming obsessed with this addictive format once you start its hard to stop and i think viewers fascination with pop culture will keep them coming back for more or they can tune in and be bathed in my boyish enthusiasm
1388966 this is a game that has been a hit in 17 countries and in 26 languages so the opportunity to bring the brand to television with chris in the drivers seat is really a thrill
1388967 with chris at the helm we are sure that this show will find a very passionate audience

1389014 mccain has fought one battle after another against lobbyists and special interests
1389015 john mccain has fought for 14 long hard years for reforms that seriously limit lobbyists power he has fought for campaign finance reform limits on gifts and travel from lobbyists and extensive public disclosure of lobbyists activities all of which limit the influence of lobbyists and the companies that hire lobbyists in washington d c
1389016 one thing overlooked in flap over mccain and lobbyists his record on reform
1389017 ten years ago senator john mccain took on the tobacco industry saying he would never back down from legislation to regulate the industry mccains decade of work on tobacco one of the most significant efforts of his congressional career has earned him enmity from the industry and from some fellow republicans over the years
1389018 in 1998 mccain championed anti smoking legislation that faced furious opposition from the tobacco lobby mccain guided the legislation through the senate commerce committee on a 19 1 vote but then the tobacco companies struck back they hired 200 lobbyists and spent 40 million in advertising three times as much as the harry and louise health care reform ads many of the ads attacked mccain by name accusing him of becoming a big government liberal after weeks of bitter debate the bill died on the senate floor
1389019 at a press conference today sen olympia j snowe r maine introduced breakthrough bipartisan consensus prescription drug reimportation legislation the pharmaceutical market access and drug safety act with sens byron dorgan d nd john mccain r az ted kennedy d ma tom daschle d sd trent lott r ms and debbie stabenow d mi
1389020 mccain said he wanted the government to be able to negotiate lower drug prices and import cheaper drugs from canada both ideas that were adamantly opposed by industry lobbyists and which ultimately failed
1389021 the most public front was active last week with the senate passing a bill intended to make it easier for cheap generic drugs to come onto the market the bill sponsored by sens charles schumer d n y and john mccain r ariz drew considerable support in congress and strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry
1389022 in 2002 mccain capped his long push for campaign finance reform by passing the mccain feingold act people can argue about the effectiveness of the act but one thing is beyond dispute it was a direct assault on lobbyist power and earned mccain undying enmity among many important parts of the republican coalition who felt their soft money influence was being diminished
1389023 exposed billions of dollars of waste and layers of contracting irregularity
1389024 in 2004 mccain launched a frontal assault on the leasing contract the pentagon had signed with boeing for aerial refueling tankers mccains investigation exposed billions of dollars of waste and layers of contracting irregularity
1389025 in 2005 mccain led the congressional investigation into the behavior of the lobbyist jack abramoff the investigation was exceedingly unpleasant for republicans because it exposed shocking misbehavior by important conservative activists
1389026 americans are right to be offended when extravagant ceo salaries and severance deals bear no relation to their companys success or shareholders wishes as president john mccain will see that wrongdoing of this kind is called to account by federal prosecutors under his reforms all aspects of a ceos pay including severance arrangements must be approved by shareholders
1389027 a leader we can believe in to help small businesses
1389028 the task force will aggressively investigate potential criminal wrongdoing in the mortgage industry and bring to justice any who violated the law the doj task force will offer assistance to state attorney generals who are investigating abusive lending practices
1389029 congress already has several investigations underway to examine this kind of wagering in our energy markets unrelated to any kind of productive commerce because it can distort the market drive prices beyond rational limits and put the investments and pensions of millions of americans at risk john mccain believes that where we find abuses they need to be swiftly punished to make sure it never happens again we must reform the laws and regulations governing the oil futures market so that they are just as clear and effective as the rules applied to stocks bonds and other financial instruments
1389030 this bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country the handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for people of arizona i cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency security and energy independence

1389062 it was life changing i plan to go to slow food nation because i do not want to miss another chance for a life changing event
1389063 terra madre was a heart event it was a thrill to see families still making the food they have made for centuries you feel this human thing it was very emotional and made me cry some recipes for corn bread for example had been handed down for twenty generations
1389064 i love the apple farmers here in sonoma county they are courageous there is a history here that we need to remember
1389065 slow food is an opportunity to re connect with our food and local growers and to understand the plight our planet is in our immunity and the immune system of the earth are linked building from here is a source of our healing
1389066 it helps create a sense of what real nourishment is it brings farmers children and the community back into the food system rather than leaving it in the hands of large corporations slow food encourages people to grow and cook their own food and remember the pleasure in that
1389067 it was intense being around people from over 150 countries in their traditional dress who have this common bond and language of the land growing food preserving local food cultures preparing serving and nourishing others

1389160 the environment in the u s and for u s carriers continues to be challenging impacting in particular our orders and revenues
1389161 i do believe we are making good progress in the first half in a pretty tough environment which is generally out there for the industry
1389162 we have been focusing on driving operational and financial performance as we began our turnaround a couple of years ago in almost every measure weve shown improvement
1389163 with the performance that weve had in the first half and our plans for the second half we are absolutely committed to that guidance
1389164 we are facing pressures headwinds in terms of the global macroeconomic environment
1389165 at the beginning of the year it was primarily in the u s now we are seeing signs within certain other parts of the world particularly europe where the pressures have been intensifying
1389166 improved from 34 million in quarter two of last year to 114 million in quarter two this year
1389167 what we have to do over time as the operating margin improves is to get that net loss position into a net profit
1389168 of course in this environment we are increasing cost controls across the board and youll see some of those results already in the q2 financials
1389169 we are moving now from the transformation stage to a growth stage we know its not going to be easy but this is the logical next step
1389170 not as impressive as it may appear at first glance
1389171 revenue upside was aided by the recognition of 314 million of previously deferred higher margin business
1389172 we believe higher profitability at the lg nortel joint venture and deferred revenues likely aided operating margins too gross margin of 43 per cent plus was impressive but it was tough to isolate organic performance
1389173 primarily from customer mix due to the recognition of higher margin deferred revenues and cost reduction initiatives partially offset by the negative impacts of price erosion and product mix

1389261 its dangerous we are getting complaints from people who work in that area on piedmont avenue
1389262 theres been no injuries because of our occupation of the median
1389263 we are careful and we are respectful of the neighbors and the large forces in the world such as the trucks and cars and buses
1389264 the university built the first fence last august and the second fence in november and then when they put up the barricades they thought they could get rid of us
1389265 but we wont go away the fact is we are holding this space its still our grove and we arent going anywhere
1389266 i think it would be appropriate for the city to take action its a city ordinance trespassing illegal lodging they are violating
1389267 from our perspective our primary concern is safety and it doesnt appear there is an urgent safety issue there
1389268 if and when it becomes necessary we will take appropriate action at the appropriate time
1389269 there are businesses that are friendly toward us and let people use the bathrooms and i think in general people are supportive we try to maintain good relationships with the neighbors
1389270 we are careful and we are respectful of the neighbors and the large forces in the world such as the trucks and cars and buses

1389415 welcome to your family what a lucky girl she was meant to be yours
1389416 i have an extensive music collection on original cd media while most of it is in impeccable condition i have a few discs that have suffered extensive scratching through listening to the disc either via a portable disc player or in a car cd stacker ive long since learned the error of my old ways and dont listen to discs in those devices any more but those discs are irreplaceable in many cases i would very much like to be able to repair them or have them repaired to original condition or at least well enough that i can pull the tracks off once and archive the track data i have heard really uncomplimentary things about devices like the ranging from it not helping to it making things worse ive heard great things about clean the disk well and rip it with cdparanoia try ripping it with both cdparanoia and with get toothpaste not gel but regular white paste get a small cloth put a dab on it then rub it from the center to the outside in straight lines going outwards around the whole disk when youre done clean it off and pat it dry disk will look like hell but itll work polishing anything requires a lot of skill to get it right its just as easy to screw up your cd than to make it better learn how to carefully polish things before you start and practice on things you dont need toothpaste will not remove scratches that you can feel but it may clean out the grooves of the scratch enough for them to be read 1 take a power drill make sure the hammer action is off 2 place the cd on the chuck tighten the chuck around a bolt and washer to keep it in place 3 clamp the drill in a bench vice 4 spin the cd at 30 000rpm toothpaste eh working porn dvd and clean teeth all in one swoop the way this works by the way is that white toothpaste contains fullers earth wikipedia org which is a very mild abrasive this polishes the disk back to readability use this as your last resort only when eac and cdparanoia have both failed note also if you hold the disk up to the light and see i wonder if that works on 3 5
1389417 i suspect it was their choice you would have to talk to them as to what prompted them to do this
1389418 i will say this i am not a scientist but in my view that was unnecessary
1389419 i dont believe there was any statement trying to be made
1389420 olympics u s cyclists fly into china with face masks
1389421 but no british competitors have felt the need to resort to wearing face masks which will be made available
1389422 i would not carry a mask i do not see a need for that this is not a measure i would recommend unless you have a particular disorder
1389423 i would not say that those people should not carry protection devices if they so feel but i honestly doubt about the efficiency unless they are carrying a new generation of masks i dont know
1389424 while n95 face masks may provide some benefit most commercially available air masks were not designed to protect against all forms of air pollution for example they dont protect against gases like ozone smog which will be one of the important components of the air in beijing
1389425 jesse jackson was an important figure paving the way for osama bin laden to appear

1389438 ich habe mich immer gegen die zensur in china gewandt mir etwas anderes zu unterstellen ist unfair falsch und absurd
1389439 bei uns sind es rechtsradikale seiten die gesperrt werden und es ist nat rlich auch in china so dass einzelne seiten gesperrt werden
1389440 ich wollte nur auf die tatsache hinweisen dass berall auf der welt webseiten gesperrt sind aber damit wollte ich nicht die politische zensur in china rechtfertigen
1389441 der profi fu ball braucht rechtssicherheit und planbarkeit auch mit blick auf kommende rechteperioden im sinne unserer clubs die in den vergangenen jahren erhebliche investitionen beispielsweise in die stadieninfrastruktur vorgenommen haben m ssen wir bereit sein diesen weg zu gehen

1389450 people enjoy the fact they can walk from one area to another in a safe way

1389462 the increased acceptance of greener vehicles such as hybrid and electric vehicles is to be encouraged they have an important role in improving fuel economy and reducing emissions our advanced external sound synthesis technology increases pedestrian safety while retaining the cars environmental benefits we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety
1389463 blind and partially sighted people use the noise of oncoming traffic as a cue for when it is safe to cross a road if a quiet hybrid electric vehicle is approaching then they will no longer have this cue and are immediately put at risk
1389464 as the leading voice on transport and mobility issues in the visual impairment sector guide dogs believes further research and development is needed to address the issues of identifying quiet vehicles for blind and partially sighted people the charity recognises the environmental benefits of these vehicles however more consideration needs to be given to the safety implications to visually impaired pedestrians
1389465 road safety professionals teach children that they can improve their safety by listening for traffic and the sound of an approaching vehicle is a warning that most pedestrians will use before making the decision to cross the road new electric engines make vehicles much quieter so we need to look at ways of ensuring the safety of pedestrians we welcome innovative solutions which address this
1389466 thanks for the thrashing would you like some coffee one lump or two

1389475 destroy a government leave americans in the lurch and enrich themselves all at the same time
1389476 the government of our nation deliberately fibbed us into a pointless catastrophic war
1389477 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1389478 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1389479 conservatives still think highly of him and are enthusiastic supporters whenever he speaks
1389480 for a campaign that has largely failed in reaching out to conservatives reaching out to cheney wouldnt be a bad idea
1389481 this is the ninth presidential campaign ive covered i cant remember a more scurrilous statement by a major party candidate it smacks of desperation it renews questions about whether mccain has the right temperament for the presidency
1389482 john mccain stood up against george bush and don rumsfeld in the prosecution of the iraq war for many years
1389483 ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
1389484 id like to start out by giving you a little straight talk under the present setup because weve mortgaged our childrens futures you will not have social security benefits that present day retirees have unless we fix it and americans have got to understand that americans have got to understand that we are paying present day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in america today emphasis added and thats a disgrace its an absolute disgrace and its gotta be fixed
1389485 getting out of iraq will require just as much resolution as it took to get in and the same kind of resolution a willingness to ignore the consequences

1389491 non lo so tutti i giorni si dicono le stesse cose aspettiamo sarebbe una bella notizia se i dirigenti della roma fossero a madrid per trattare baptista chiede di giocare vuole un club che gli dia questa opportunit ma devono mettersi daccordo i club
1389492 non c percentuale complicato dirlo la roma una societ importante che gioca la champions un club di livello ci sono possibilit ma non dipende solo dal giocatore la roma un club che a julio piace se la roma soddisfer economicamente il real e il giocatore si potr prendere in considerazione il trasferimento

1389499 unbreakable tour marks girlicious first tour since their group was formed on
1389500 they were the in the heat of the moment boy band
1389501 we grew up listening to them and nsync so its crazy that were even going to be touring with them
1389502 of course we have our bickering but when we have a problem with each other we get it out and resolve it right away most importantly we have lots of fun with each other were all pretty much the same type of girl so we have a lot in common
1389503 when i was 16 i saved all my money from my summer job to buy a truck
1389504 i had a brand new stereo installed and proudly drove that truck to the cd release party for keith urbans golden road i floated out of that show on cloud nine knowing that my life and all my dreams had just changed forever only to find that my truck and my new cd player had been stolen but it barely fazed me i remember thinking that whoever had my truck could have it i had my cd a new dream and i wouldnt trade my experience at that show for anything
1389505 i have met so many people who watched me every week and told me how much my determination inspired them
1389506 im honored to be an encouragement to people and my goal as an artist is to remind every audience i encounter that personal issues and insecurities should never keep you from pursuing the things you love i have my life back now and i want to inspire others who have similar dreams but lack the motivation to achieve them
1389507 theres so much that happens in the first episode that sets up the rest of the season

1389513 nicole has a dance background so her choreography skills were really great
1389514 i think the boys liked the hot dog stand wardrobe more than i did
1389515 i wont tell you what the new job is but i like the color scheme better
1389516 having your voice listened to is a privilege not a right and its a privilege thats earned in proportion to the contribution level not volume level
1389517 im obsessive about the way i live and work so when it comes to renovating i believe in finding the true integrity of a house then breathing life back into it in a way that connects with a certain type of buyer
1389518 list your home 5 percent below the most recent comparable sale
1389519 always make your house available for showings and open houses dont give a buyer a reason to buy the house next door
1389520 respond to all offers no matter how low buyers will lowball just to see how motivated you are dont take it personally
1389521 since 25 to 33 percent of buyers cancel escrow do whatever you have to do to keep your buyer happy this may include giving a credit doing repairs or paying a portion of your buyers closing costs
1389522 boyd s the kind of guy who just upon looking at him it seems like hes been there done that and seen it all
1389523 that was the essence i wanted to borrow from him he has that gravitas to him because of his life experience both in jail and his experience as a junkie and the business of savings lives
1389524 as a father myself i have all these new life experiences to bring to the work while striving to be a good husband and good father william is also distracted by his newly chosen vocation
1389525 more often than not he fails at being a great husband and a great parent i can relate on a personal level because of the amount of time work requires me to be away from my own family
1389526 what my wife and i faced as parents was like being in a tunnel of darkness for the first few years of her life because we didnt know what to do
1389527 but we educated ourselves and assembled the best team of therapists we could
1389528 sophia has blown us away with the amount of progress shes made she understands everything and shes quick to laugh shes loving and a physically beautiful child
1389529 were trying to illuminate the theme of hope one thing i really love about the show is ultimately it is an exploration about the possibility of a second chance
1389530 third season is definitely gonna be the best one yet so i am so stoked about it
1389531 i feel good right now that i got my true love i wanna be with her forever and ever and ever man
1389532 what pauley perrette does not want you to know is that she hired that girl and paid her to make those claims so she can try and throw me in jail
1389533 so that she could use her status as an actress in a primetime television show to help fox news do a story about what a horrible abuser of woman i am
1389534 pauley perrette also lied to a court to get a restraining order against me so that she can then fabricate evidence saying that i violated the order so that she can have me then have me thrown in jail again and so that she can publicly portray me as some sort of horrible stalker
1389535 she continues to file more and more papers saying he raped angela garber he raped garber but when i say ok lets get angela garber in here to answer more questions she spends thousands of dollars to make sure that cant happen

1389578 its a little bit rude when your neighbors are fighting next door for you to go knock on the door and ask what happened we handle it ourselves its between us and its nobodys business but it wasnt that big a deal

1389590 oh by the way i ate those delicious plums you were saving for breakfast sorry
1389591 i was writing it as it was happening so i like to think theyre fresh
1389592 the editing was excruciating that was as difficult if not more difficult than the writing at the time of recovery the book was the one thing i could control i couldnt control the drinking the law or the case but i could control the book during the editing i had to really battle to keep control if it
1389593 given the pain the sun also rises would not have been worth it to me i would have much rather avoided the whole thing
1389594 that said i feel i did the best i could with a bad situation i at least rose to the occasion and didnt move to a red roof inn and continue drinking at least not yet
1389595 its a reasonable expectation to think that laundry products and air fresheners would be free of chemicals that can cause cancer
1389596 but as this uw study shows its disturbingly easy to find toxic chemicals in everyday products like these because companies dont have to say whats in their products
1389597 consumer demand for less toxic products will encourage companies to reformulate their products
1389598 this is a case where a little information could have a great public benefit
1389599 the study found 58 different volatile organic compounds vocs at levels above a concentration of 300 parts per billion but did not list the concentration of each chemical to put this in context 300 parts per billion is just above the level of analytical detection for these materials ingredients which sound scary when listed by their chemical names are materials that occur naturally in everyday items often in much larger quantities than may be used in fragranced products some examples include alpha pinene pine forests acetone cheddar cheese apple juice strawberries 2 butanone coffee citrus fruit grapes benzaldehyde white bread at gt 40 000 000 ppb roasted coffee at 2 000 000 ppb apple juice at around 300 000 ppb ethanol blackberries cauliflower cherries cucumbers ethyl acetate honey tomatoes vinegar it would be folly to declare the numerous pine forests lining the west and east coasts toxic or hazardous just because they give off the voc alpha pinene even more folly to put a hazard warning on a tomato which naturally contains 8 501 000 parts per billion of benzaldehye or even to require forests and tomatoes to be labeled with their constituent chemicals so why does steinemann want the fragrance industry to label the very low levels of these same chemicals when contained in our products and why does she impute that these chemicals are hazardous when clearly that is not the case

1389807 recordings of actual radio broadcasts from the 1920s are extremely rare and recordings from before the formation of the nbc and cbs networks in 1926 and 1927 respectively are even more so technology was the main reason as electrical as opposed to acoustic recording was not perfected until 1925 because of this scarcity this recording transcribed on one side of a series of thick discs on march 14th 1925 would be of historical interest no matter what the content the fact that it is a recording of the first scheduled transatlantic broadcast via shortwave converted and sent to the listening public on the am band makes it truly important though the static laden music from london has little value as entertainment its significance as an invisible link between britain and the u s was tremendous

1389816 i find that for me personally jewish understand ings of g d and
1389817 these guidelines will prevent a blurring of the lines between the role of military and humanitarian actors preventing humanitarian space from being squeezed further
1389818 recognizing the distinct role that we have to play will be a vital component of protecting our impartiality and opening up humanitarian space for us

1389821 we knew for a while that all the interrogations and questioning was being recorded and that that was the routine
1389822 this is very suggestive that there is a fundamental change going on in the electorate
1389823 clearly the defendant deliberately and with premeditation took his daughter from her legal guardian when he had no right to do so
1389824 the quake had potential for tsunami but it did not occur and we did not issue the warning
1389825 the u s anthrax attacks stand nearly alone in our database and anthrax has been used as a terror weapon very infrequently since 1970
1389826 in 1993 the japanese group aum shinri kyo attempted to disperse anthrax in tokyo and in the area around japans parliament both attacks failed in fact there have only been a handful of bio chemical attacks of any type on record and perhaps the most prominent ones go back to aum shinri kyos sarin attacks in tokyo in the 1990s
1389827 relative to explosives you need a lot of bio chemical materials to inflict mass casualties and the materials must be handled very carefully
1389828 that doesnt mean bio chemical weapons dont pose a serious potential hazard but so far at least they have not been the weapon of choice

1389831 we have a two year plan and if were fortunate we can get fedor to fight randy couture in september of 2008
1389832 if were fortunate for that to happen it would accelerate our program

1389838 let me say this ive never been more nervous on the field in my life
1389839 ill stand out there in the rain storm all day long but thunder and lightning in that kind of proximity its definitely a hazard
1389840 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1389841 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1389842 growing up in texas you see those kinds of storms all the time you learn that lightning is nothing to fool around with
1389843 if they had continued the game i wouldnt have gone back out there not for a while
1389844 like i said before the inning you have to be an idiot to stand outside during a lightning storm thats just common sense
1389845 when the last one hit it was too close even for us and i pulled them off i would never put any team or player or umpire in harms way
1389846 it was pretty crazy lightning and tornado sirens going off the weather was pretty nuts
1389847 actually it looked like somebody stood above the stadium with a ziplock bag full of water and opened it up it really did you could barely even see right field

1389850 police recruitment needs to be a lot more confident and assertive about selling policing uk the brand is there in some ways but its quite narrow people think of an officer on the street when they think of a policing career but thats narrow
1389851 the more you find out about whats on offer and the difference between someone out on streets dealing with response to forensics to covert its amazing one of things we need to do is think about how we communicate about the jobs that are available
1389852 it is our routines and our comforts that allow us to ignore social issues for some of us it i

1389873 certainly speaking to him at the end of the test match at edgbaston it was a huge relief
1389874 hes had a fantastic record but had the pressure for a long time i think he thinks its time to look after himself a little bit have a break with the family and then come back and try and show what a quality batter he still is and fight his way back into the team
1389875 hes come to his decision that enough was enough hes had a good run and led england through some great times culminating in that ashes victory in 2005
1389876 he feels the time is right to stand down and let another man have a go hes a really good player still what has been really impressive his how fit he has been
1389877 one of the first things i wanted to do when we were going to offer him the captaincy was to sit down with him and talk to him about where he was coming from and what were his views about where he wanted the side to go and whether they matched with mine
1389878 we sat down and talked for a good hour or so and by the end of it we both felt very confident that we were coming from the same place which was exciting so i drove away quite buoyant and excited about what the future might hold
1389879 what i like about kevin is hes got a view thats going to be important in his captaincy hes passionate hes committed about the way he goes about his cricket

1389884 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1389885 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1389886 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1389887 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1389888 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1389889 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1389890 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1389891 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1389892 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

1389899 the white house had concocted a fake letter from iraqi intelligence chief tahir jalil habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1389900 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1389901 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1389902 libel and slander are one of the most misunderstood legal concepts many people mistakenly believe that theyve been slandered or libeled if another person says something negative about them but that is simply not the case a person is slandered or libeled only if a third party says something untrue about them

1389955 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1389956 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1389957 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1389958 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1389959 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1389960 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1389961 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1389962 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1389963 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1389964 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1389965 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1389966 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1389967 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1389968 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1389969 who are open to doing something on the production side
1389970 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1389971 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1389972 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

1389977 god gave us brains he expects us to use them
1389978 we need to look not at science nor at religion but at the popular culture
1389979 its a fundamental misconception of how both science and religion work
1389980 good science is a very religious act the search for truth is the same as the search for god
1389981 our theology prepared science to accept the seeming contradictions of quantum theory for instance just because something doesnt seem to make sense is no proof that it must be false
1389982 the desire for truth and understanding including understanding the truth of the natural world was given to us by god in order to lead us to god it is the desire for god it is why i am a scientist it is why the vatican supports me

1389984 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1389985 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1389986 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1389987 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1389988 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1389989 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1389990 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1389991 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1389992 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1389993 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1389994 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1389995 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1389996 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1389997 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1389998 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1389999 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
