930033 managing the dragon how im building a billion dollar business in china
930034 asimco supplies my fuel injection system you also supply other important components such as my piston rings camshafts and air compressors you might say that asimco controls our engine
930035 if you want to do business in china jack perkowski is your man in managing the dragon he takes you into the heart of the middle kingdom and shows you the way with insight humor and the kind of practical advice an entrepreneur or a down home tourist needs to navigate this fascinating and often bewildering colossus of a country
930036 ive just finished managing the dragon which i thought was fantastic i was riveted by it i cannot believe what jack perkowski has accomplished and what an adventure hes had how he lived through it how he has succeeded and how well written his book is it reads somewhere between a novel a how to book and primer on a second business life in a developing country
930037 i love jack perkowskis book it tells with some bravado and lots of humility the first hand story of a man who dared himself to move to china to seize upon the greatest economic boom of our age perkowski invites us into his world into the blur of business meetings and friendships hirings firings and onto chinas shop floors he reveals what it took to build a world class manufacturing company in a country that like perkowski himself needed to set firm goals but reach them in an environment where the rules and circles of influence shift daily managing the dragon is more than a manual more than a memoir it is a gift from a seasoned friend offering the keys to his wisdom and experience
930038 managing the dragon is more than a great story about jack perkowski and his courage to move to the new frontier it is a graduate degree in the trials tribulations and successes of starting from scratch in china jack captures the essence of doing business in china and turns it into a very compelling how to guide my experiences in china over the last 14 years validate the accuracy of jack perceptions managing the dragon is superb and will be a must read for any borgwarner executive involved with china
930039 business books on china are published so frequently these days it seems there is a secret factory churning them out

930051 agnes isnt a regular merchant for the market but with the numbers anticipated her expertise and resources would be better suited to cater the teas and coffees

930087 all of this could have been easily corrected with off the shelf technology that was available at the time
930088 even then you could have gone into circuit city and bought a hand held gps unit that would have prevented all of those problems
930089 now theyre not just throwing darts in the dark which is typically how these decisions are made

930103 certainly over the past few years there was much foolish lending that had led to severe losses and the economy will suffer in the short run but actions by central banks will assure that this credit crisis does not morph into a full blown recession or worse and in the long run saner lending and more reasonable home prices will lead to a stronger economic recovery
930104 the best case scenario is a mild recession and a slow recovery that s the best ocutcome we can hope for

930145 na ja noch liegt das durchschnittseinkommen in deutschland oder in den anderen l ndern des euro atlantischen raums ziemlich deutlich ber dem in china zudem haben wir nicht so gro e soziale unterschiede wie in china unser system scheint mir eindeutig das berlegene darauf deutet brigens auch hin dass andere gro e l nder des asiatischen raums allen voran indien es vorziehen demokratien zu sein aber wir sollten diese berzeugung nicht mit arroganz vertreten
930146 eigentlich sind die kriegsgefangenen in guantanamo die zufriedensten menschen sie bekommen ihr essen und trinken frei haus sollten wir deutschland zu einem guantanamo 2 0 umbauen
930147 we knew this was one of those things that we needed to act on as soon as possible

930149 i kind of feel like we were strong armed into it
930150 i dont feel like districting is going to change the number of registered voters or the number of candidates
930151 it should actually probably become a standing commission or committee within the city

930167 we anticipate that the real estate and construction industry will feel a significant impact of the rocketing oil prices and the rising freight costs in the coming months considering the massive projects that are being launched
930168 the greatest and most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever to be leveled in modern times
930169 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
930170 in the midst of exhausting prison camp relocations marching in a column of prisoners in the gloom of bitterly cold evenings with strings of camp lights glimmering through the darkness we would often feel rising in our breast what we would have wanted to shout out to the whole world if only the whole world could have heard us
930171 it is within the power of writers and artists to do much more to defeat the lie
930172 in terms of the effect he has had on history solzhenitsyn is the dominant writer of the 20th century who else compares orwell koestler and yet when his name comes up now it is more often than not as a freak a monarchist an anti semite a crank a has been
930173 solzhenitsyn is a notable writer but his political views are an embarrassment even to his fellow dissidents
930174 not only would a meeting with the president offend the soviets but it would raise some controversy about solzhenitsyns views of the united states and its allies
930175 we were laughing and agreeing about how we thought solzhenitsyns views on the united states his criticism of the press and all the rest were deeply wrong and on and on
930176 and then joseph said but you know susan everything solzhenitsyn says about the soviet union is true
930177 shukov felt pleased with his life as he went to sleep
930178 the end of an unclouded day almost a happy one
930179 just one of the 3 653 days of his sentence from bell to bell the extra three days were for leap years

930181 theres a stalinist in each of you theres even a stalinist in me we must root out this evil
930182 it is impossible to go on writing as one did before
930183 probably i would not have survived eight years of the camps if as a mathematician i had not been assigned for three years to a sharashka
930184 i was like the sick people all around me and yet i was different
930185 i had fewer rights than they had and was forced to be more silent people came to visit them and their one concern their one aim in life was to get well again but if i recovered it would be almost pointless i was 35 years of age and yet in that spring i had no one i could call my own in the whole world i did not even own a passport and if i were to recover i should have to leave this green abundant land and go back to my desert where i had been exiled in perpetuity there i was under open surveillance reported on every fortnight and for a long time the local police had not even allowed me a dying man to go away for treatment
930186 demand and ensure the abolition of all censorship open or hidden
930187 no one can bar the road to truth and to advance its cause i am prepared to accept even death
930188 courageous creative work upholding the sense of human dignity and exposing the trampling of the human soul and the destruction of human values
930189 she simply joined me in my struggle and we went side by side
930190 in a strange way i not only hope i am inwardly convinced that i shall go back
930191 i live with that conviction i mean my physical return not just my books and that contradicts all rationality
930192 he wrote ate and slept and that was about all
930193 for him to accept a telephone call was an event he rarely left his 50 acres
930194 instead of secluding myself here and writing the red wheel i suppose i could have spent time making myself likable to the west
930195 the only problem is that i would have had to drop my way of life and my work
930196 his own convictions are deeply rooted in the russian spirit which is untempered by the civilizing influences of a democratic tradition
930197 like the russian masses he we may assume has strong authoritarian tendencies
930198 leading intellectuals here consider his oratory hollow his time past and his mission unclear

930203 companies cant really stop it they might as well embrace it consumers are demanding these types of devices which is good for everyone
930204 while the iphone is closed it does have the openness characteristics which are unique
930205 what we want to do is bring the openness of the personal computer to the phone
930206 we want people to be able to play around you cant do that now on a mobile phone
930207 but considering we have a population of people who have grown up creating their own web pages its not unfathomable
930208 if im a developer my job is to surprise and delight as many people as i can
930209 thats hard right now because of this fragmentation we want that to go away for very selfish reasons we can tell people to go to google
930210 generally speaking within 5 years you are about back where you were so my husband and i decided well take the hit and live with it
930211 this is the kind of conversation thats going on at cocktail parties at swimming pools
930212 and suddenly this option which was truly unthinkable in the past becomes thinkable
930213 i think people are taking a more cold hearted look at it
930214 is the bank going to pay for my retirement because i was a good girl and paid my mortgage even though legally i didnt have to
930215 if all that is needed is that the house value is less than the mortgage value there is a large number of homeowners in the united states who are in that situation
930216 i would say its probably 70 of the volume of our foreclosures right now
930217 its a business decision for their family that the smartest thing they can do is walk away from their home
930218 the losses for the financial system from people walking away could be of the order of one trillion dollars when the entire capital of the us banking system is only 1 3 trillion
930219 you could have most of the us banking system wiped out so this is a total disaster
930220 hundreds of thousands of people in the uk have jobs in sectors where tipping is commonplace
930221 when people leave a tip in a restaurant or elsewhere they expect it to go to service staff and as consumers weve got a right to know if that actually happens
930222 this is an issue of fairness and common sense and its one many people clearly care a lot about
930223 waiters and waitresses across the country have been hungry for the tips loophole to be closed and the announcement today will satisfy their appetites
930224 it is great news that unscrupulous employers will no longer be able to use the tips left for staff to subsidise low wages
930225 the government is right to make sure that workers can keep their tips and that the responsibility to pay the minimum wage rests squarely with employers
930226 this is a welcome example of the government responding to the concerns of hard pressed vulnerable workers
930227 far too many rogue employers have been using tips to make up the national minimum wage

930231 the second victim was the additional factor making it necessary for me as the district attorney to turn the matter over to the north carolina attorney generals office in order to fulfill the terms of my oath of office
930232 from that time the attorney generals office has been responsible for the abril investigation indictment and prosecution
930233 insufficient evidence at this time to warrant moving these cases to any other venue besides polk county however the motion to change the venue may be reconsidered and redetermined by the trial judge should it appear to the said judge during jury selection that a fair trial can not be had
930234 i dont know if this is legal in this game
930235 it gives you an opportunity to put faces to names and you get to see what they stand for
930236 i hope it shows everyone that there is a strong democratic party here and that were going to make a difference in november
930237 we had about 150 to 200 people dropping in throughout the afternoon so we had a great crowd
930238 the purpose for this was two fold to show that our democratic party is united and to show people that there are a lot of democrats in henderson county
930239 you get the chance to hear what peoples concerns are ive been around many people and i hear the same things they want good schools and a lot of the things that are being done at the state and federal level arent working
930240 people are concerned about health insurance about mental health issues the people i talk to are concerned about growth and its effects on the environment
930241 this is a fantastic event and there is a great energy people are really excited about the election this year
930242 people are working hard to get good people elected and it makes us as candidates feel so good i really enjoy meeting people and showing them that i have a lot of the same issues they do as a working parent of two young children to hear what they think about things
930243 we want to show all the new democrats who have moved into henderson county that the countys democratic party is alive and well and were looking for them to jump in and volunteer
930244 not president bush but that disgraceful crowd who have been in control for the last eight years

930247 its not about saying vista is perfect or that all these people fell in love with it
930248 what people have heard about vista is different from the reality
930249 a lot of what people have complained about will be addressed as it evolves
930250 thats the way i see it things are bound to pick up
930251 people talk about recovery but on one level were still responding
930252 i know i can get a decent job i know i can make this work
930253 i got in this situation myself but im not going to let this situation drown me and i see im drowning
930254 it was never anticipated that the permanent supportive housing program was going to take responsibility for all of femas disabled clients
930255 when we put this together we did not anticipate how much homelessness was going to explode we had always been hoping that fema was going to continue to support these people instead of just dumping them on us
930256 theyre finding people with no furniture and their lights off
930257 i believe that beijings olympics are now facing real threats from terrorist attacks
930258 i think the olympics are the most important international sports event in four years
930259 and its the biggest focus of the international media in four years so this might draw some attention from terrorist groups
930260 the threat remains moderate but slightly elevated because of the olympics
930261 the chinese have been on these people a long time
930262 the surveillance system deployed by china for the olympics which includes key pieces of western technology is the most comprehensive and sophisticated surveillance system ever
930263 properly used it will definitely increase security at the olympics and western companies will have contributed to that security
930264 you take a born pretty girl and you dress her up in pretty things curl her pretty hair and she becomes empty
930265 underpricing a home to create an auction like frenzy started on really great homes in nice neighbourhoods
930266 now everyone is doing it on any old piece of crap
930267 theres no way my client was going to get that home for anywhere near the listing price
930268 even if i was the only buyer they still wouldnt have sold me the house which is ludicrous
930269 i was at one listing recently where there were 19 bids on one property thats 19 people who have to call their mortgage broker maybe get a house inspection take time off work and pay for babysitters
930270 the problem with listings today is that the list price means nothing
930271 the truth is it may be listed at a pickering price
930272 you might see a lot of agents with egg on their faces if they try and create an auction and nobody shows up
930273 it is the lazy agents way of having to deal with a listing for only seven days
930274 its detrimental to the seller you might have 19 bids but only two people can really afford the house because youve attracted everyone else who cant with a lower listing so its completely artificial
930275 and of course the house is going to sell over asking because its underpriced in the first place
930276 it doesnt work for every neighbourhood but if you have a popular area you can generate more interest in the property
930277 auctions bidding wars and the various ways of marketing properties are driven by the marketplace
930278 treb and others do not have the right to interfere with a market driven function
930279 the rule should read that the listing should be immediately available for presentation of offers as well
930280 that would end up stopping the one day auction mentality that agents try to create
930281 whatever happened to the old method of doing a proper appraisal listing it at 2 to 5 per cent above market value open a listing up for showings and taking offers as soon as they come in its much fairer for the buyers opens up the sellers to get the best possible price and takes the false hype out of the marketplace
930282 i just got sick of playing their game and feeling manipulated
930283 i just didnt even bother looking at a lot of the properties because of that
930284 this is a wonderful wonderful find for me today and a great acquisition a great treasure to add to my collection they are monogrammed and crested and we know that they are hers
930285 it must be an embarrassment for the wives of other heads of state to see this beautiful creature who can wear anything and speak like that

930333 social networking sites have also been targeted through the development of a missing persons myspace profile and with videos being uploaded on youtube extending the reach of the campaign to an international audience and for the first time this years advertising campaign went online at various youth focused websites

930352 its probably the best test out there of a political climate being a republican incumbents worst enemy
930353 he does constituent service he shows up to work he votes he brings home the bacon there are not a lot of inherent things wrong with john sununu except that he is a republican
930354 but with the economy going the way it has been going the last few years nobody in any office looks too good right now
930355 that kind of effective leadership will be contrasted by the media by me by others to the things she failed to do as governor
930356 she raised spending to record levels which i think people have come to expect from liberal democrats
930357 when i am out on the campaign trail talking to people in new hampshire i dont hear people say we need to elect a democrat
930358 what i hear them say is we need to change the direction of this country
930359 whats important is that you cast a vote that is based in principle

930395 were a very very conservative company we turn back on just about everything and so we should thats the way weve operated over so many years
930396 and by the way that is why we do have such a good record and that record is still very very good
930397 it was quickly rectified and there were no safety implications at any time
930398 we experience these sorts of delays right across our business
930399 the pre flight inspections are done as part of the safety systems within qantas and every other airline for that matter for this exact reason to find anything the crew or the engineers are not happy with
930400 there are so many potential problems that can be picked up before the aircraft is in the air it was a hydraulic leak a very routine event
930401 it shows that the safety system is working as it should in fact we should all be encouraged that the systems are working well

930412 i would like to apologise to both the parents and family of heidi murphy for what i have done which caused her death
930413 my intention was only to steal because i was pushed by economic needs and the result of that burglary was meant to buy a ring and to fund my marriage
930414 i did that because both of my parents could not afford to give me this and i didnt expect at all that the incident would be something like this
930415 by gods name i didnt have any intention to do this
930416 in this criminal case the defendant clearly had no intention and purpose to kill so that sentence demanded by the prosecutor is unacceptable
930417 i admit to all my mistakes and i realise that my action has violated law which the consequence is jail for me
930418 i surrender mr judge even though it feels so heavy the punishment that i must bear because im aware that this is definitely not as sad as has been felt by both parents and the family of heidi murphy for losing the person they loved
930419 im also aware that my action has tainted and slander bali image as tourist destination
930420 please honorary judges consider being a little bit more lenient with me so that i can have the chance to improve my life and so that i can do good deeds to others for now and for the future
930421 i also beg and ask for the greatest forgiveness from the parents and family of heidi murphy who have lost their most loving daughter
930422 i also offer an apology to my own parents for causing this very deep pain
930423 i didnt know anything about the murder i only knew about the burglary

930443 he worked yesterday just like any other day then in the evening death came quickly i am in mourning but i also express gratitude to everyone who will remember this moment remember solzhenitsyn
930444 until the end of his days he fought for russia not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot
930445 like millions of citizens solzhenitsyn lived through tough times he was one of the first to talk about the inhumane stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
930446 changed the consciousness of millions of people forcing them to think more about the past and the present
930447 we will remember him as a strong brave person with enormous dignity
930448 his intransigence his ideals and his long eventful life make of solzhenitsyn a hero from a novel an heir to dostoyevsky he belongs to the pantheon of world history

930459 that autumn i learned from my own experience that a man can cross the threshold of death while occupying a body that is still not dead your blood still circulates and your stomach digests things but psychologically you have completed all your preparations for death and lived through death itself although you have never regarded yourself as a christian sometimes indeed the opposite now you suddenly notice that you have already forgiven everyone who has insulted you

930472 its not an act of leadership to throw your hands in the air and let a thousand flowers bloom
930473 oversized corsage pin cushion olive green floral with brown polka dots
930474 ein unfall ist f r die meisten betroffenen eine extreme stresssituation manche geraten dabei in panik und die reaktion kann schlie lich flucht sein
930475 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing the relationship between these titles and their readers is a relationship in which the rest of us have an interest the images they use and project reinforce a very narrow conception of beauty and a shallow approach towards women they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others or commitment to intrude the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking
930476 despite continued uncertainty in the marketplace we exceeded our quarterly revenue guidance and our sequential growth once again outpaced our peer group in the second quarter
930477 the impact that energy consumption has on climate change and the species and habitats that we look at supporting is quite a big deal for us and so is reducing power usage of our server operation
930478 we would not even dream of getting into the support requirements of running a 24 7 website infrastructure internally so we had to find a partner to take that support role the benefits apart from less power consumption are cost effectiveness and resilience due to the fact that systems run on a virtualised environment
930479 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing
930480 they have dashed the hopes and dreams of thousands of people who have been planning for years to go the games and have already paid thousands of dollars for airfare and what they thought were legitimate tickets
930481 its like shifting from standard view to wide screen high definition television
930482 eighty five per cent of our revenue comes from other sectors servers clients services and storage in partnership with emc and we find the business notebook market in developed markets to be more of a steady upgrade cycle
930483 the notebook pc market has grown far more quickly than either gartner or idc anticipated
930484 storage is just a never ending requirement the demand for digitisation grows and grows
930485 looking at a storage strategy we have storage area network islands and we are exploring our storage virtualisation options
930486 within the organisation people have a requirement for archive level storage not all of it is tier one but we do have high availability tier one for the vmware infrastructure
930487 all of the space saved by consolidating the servers is being taken up with more storage
930488 we always look at potential partnerships and at all the potential digitisation options we have regular exhibitions a current one is called taking liberties and involves displaying a copy of the magna carta often cited as the most important document in the history of britain
930489 i told the management that i was not in the business of putting in a cheap network but of putting in a good network with networks you have to plan four to five years out
930490 given that this is brocade i am not worried we use brocade for fibre channel switches and as far i am concerned the two companies are mutually exclusive
930491 the code of practice took a long time to agree and there are now a lot of hoops that have to be jumped through
930492 to develop high skilled human resources in the it field it is necessary to create the latest it environment for the education space
930493 this new online resource is an excellent way for people to find out more about nhs pregnancy and birth services and to see what local maternity services can offer them
930494 just at the time that people are demanding more and more online information we havent had a reliable place to direct people to
930495 i will definitely use this planner as back up to care and will print out the key sections for expectant parents without internet access
930496 we present them with a series of levers and tell them the expected outcome of pulling those levers at different times
930497 the other vendors activity in this space has largely been in the datacentre
930498 with the current economic climate cost will return to the corporate equation therefore finding the right partner at the right cost makes collaboration even more important
930499 big businesses need to understand exactly how to collaborate effectively both internally and externally
930500 until now it departments have resisted web 2 0 tools often viewing them as consumer grade
930501 social networking techniques and web 2 0 functionality used in the consumer environment will be demanded by the enterprise workforce who will expect new tools and technologies to be made available at any location and on any device
930502 technology cycles mean that consumer and enterprise technologies often interconnect and influence one another
930503 internet telephony such as skype and the use of instant messaging im in the home is having an influence on the availability of software and advanced features in the workplace
930504 we want our stakeholders the governors parents teachers pupils and community to become involved with school projects and an online presence where people can comment is a great way to share information
930505 its built around all the things that you find in facebook because thats the technology people use all the time
930506 if we want to promote knowledge sharing and debate then we have to use familiar tools that need no explanation
930507 the google suite is not a replacement for high end collaboration tools
930508 but it is excellent for immediate communication within smaller communities we are getting better feedback and more continuity within our projects
930509 its important that you dont just end up with a mass of technology options
930510 collaboration expertise has to lie with the user who knows which tools are most useful according to what they want to do the technology is there to do the brokering between applications but its the user who decides if they want to use im videoconferencing or presentation display tools
930511 the difficulties with rising fuel prices is bringing it home to people that perhaps they dont have to get in that car train or plane perhaps they can achieve the same outcome from home or the office

930522 gambling on gambling is a big gamble so it is more than a little alarming that gambling is such a big part pf governor arnold schwarzeneggers plan to close the states 15 2 billion budget gap as luck would have it lawsuit gambling
930523 on another question its also unfortunate that in some countries in the eu that gambling is allowed but because our servers are all in the us these residents cannot gamble this is something we can fix and were working on it
930524 no creo que nadie vaya a ganar ocho pero si hay una persona en el planeta que puede hacerlo se es michael phelps
930525 hay mucha competencia incluso en las pruebas en las que es realmente fuerte van a ser carreras dif ciles para l creo que va a ser el calendario lo que lo va a hacer dif cil tambi n tiene los relevos
930526 hay gente malintencionada pueda hacer alguna barrabasada y por ejemplo manipular estad sticas y clasificaciones
930527 extremadura siempre ha estado por debajo de la media en lo que se refiere a precios
930528 nuestra zona es una de las pocas de extremadura que tiene un ndice de crecimiento poblacional de aproximadamente un 6 ello implica que el crecimiento urban stico residencial vaya en funci n al menos de ese crecimiento poblacional
930529 estaba creciendo mucho pero ahora mismo s que hay obras paradas se encuentran muchas dificultades pare vender las viviendas de nueva construcci n en este momento el mercado es la usada est m s activo
930530 tal vez la prudencia tanto en la gesti n como en las inversiones y cierta previsi n procurando nivelar oferta y demanda antes del comienzo de algunas importantes operaciones urban sticas han hecho que en estos momentos el riesgo de una repercusi n muy grave de la crisis econ mica sea inferior a otras localidades de similar poblaci n
930531 hay pisos por 10 000 000 de las antiguas pesetas aunque antiguos pero tambi n hay casas nuevas muy bien acondicionadas por 17 000 000 18 000 000
930532 en esta convocatoria de vivienda en alquiler son ya 3 538 las viviendas ofertadas en este r gimen por la emvs que sumadas a las 7 559 viviendas gestionadas por la agencia municipal de alquiler supone poner a disposici n de los j venes y de otros sectores de la poblaci n 11 097 viviendas
930533 mais uma vez ficou demonstrado que o cska tem uma excelente equipa esta vit ria uma importante dose de moral para os jogadores
930534 temos de jogar o nosso futebol n o h como fugir a isso h que pegar no jogo rapidamente
930535 foi evidente na primeira meia hora do jogo de quarta feira que n s n o est vamos ali esta ter a feira temos um encontro importante e fulcral apresentarmo nos mais fortes
930536 n o retir mos muito do jogo com o liverpool tirando o facto de termos perdido com justi a
930537 n o me parece que o moral tenha algo que ver com isto foi um jogo amig vel e penso que estamos motivados o problema voltarmos a um n vel de jogo que nos permita competir com maior capacidade temos de encarar o facto de n o estarmos a atingir o mesmo n vel que conseguimos no in cio da temporada passada
930538 eles podem ter uma enorme reputa o por terem chegado final da ta a uefa mas constat mos na passada quarta feira que s o jogadores normais
930539 o empate a zero em ibrox foi muito bom porque vamos vencer em kaunas aposto no 1 0 talvez at tenha sorte e seja eu a marcar o tento da vit ria
930540 its really exciting that the tdhb have agreed to come on board and support our project the growing support for the film really shows how local organisations and businesses are keen to help out and be involved with the community
930541 this is going to take a long time to get together as people are so busy this time of year
930542 but in saying that it means more time can be spent on detail editing and preparation which will mean a better quality production
930543 we zullen eens tellen een mens heeft normaal 120 000 tot 150 000 haren daarvan vallen er iedere dag 150 uit ook normaal als het er meer zijn word je kaal neem nu een man met nog 75 000 haren in een krans op zijn hoofd zo iemand komt niet in aanmerking voor een transplantatie een verhuizing van 9000 haren is het maximum omdat haarwortels rap afsterven tijdens de ingreep liggen ze in een speciaal badje maar geen enkele chirurg is snel genoeg om alles op tijd klaar te krijgen
930544 there is a need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risks of diving related injuries among children and adolescents the recent growth of the sport of diving coupled with the increasing complexity and difficulty of dives has resulted in a greater potential for both competitive and recreational diving related injuries
930545 based on our findings the largest age group of injured divers was 10 to 14 year olds although this group made up the largest number of injured divers 10 to 19 years olds were more at risk for an injury to the extremities boys were two times more likely to experience a head or neck injury or a fracture
930546 parents pediatricians coaches lifeguards and trainers need to be aware of the types of injuries seen during recreational and competitive diving as well as the risk factors
930547 the wind speed is comparable to a regular dutch storm but a tornado causes a lot more damage
930548 this often causes a difference in air pressure too forming a tornado
930549 perhaps the prime ministers staff feared that the attention of journalists was being drawn to the breast over his left shoulder rather than to what he was saying
930550 i can only hope berlusconi did not know about it
930551 genmab is now on its way to filling the first ever marketing application for an antibody and the team was looking forward to continuing the work with gsk
930552 their health has deteriorated rapidly as they have lost over 11 kilograms on an average
930553 we want an immediate end to the brutal atrocities and suppression in tibet
930554 no doubt that the chinese people deserve to host the olympic games but what the tibetan and chinese people deserve more is freedom
930555 the day might not be far when tibet will be an independent nation and our chinese brothers and sisters will be free from the inhuman communist regime
930556 then it will be the right time for beijing to host the prestigious olympic games
930557 pakistan s federally administered tribal areas fata are wilder than the wild west because al qaeda has resurfaced here in the form of a new breed of taliban who are threatening both afghanistan and pakistan
930558 it is imperative to understand how this has happened if we are to combat extremism
930559 for more than a year american intelligence reports have indicated that al qaeda is rebuilding in the tribal areas of pakistan however organizing counterterrorism programs has proven to be complicated for a variety of reasons including anti pakistani government sentiments in the federally administered tribal areas fata as well as growing jihadi ideals among the people
930560 only by retrieving the arrow and straightening its jagged edges and twisted feathers can muslims aspire to attain those high ethical values which are the embodiment of faith iman based on submission to god islam
930561 us pakistan relations have been difficult in the best of times they are today at a cross roads with grave consequences for the future course of the war on terror if losing afghanistan is out of the question for the usa and nato then it is vital to understand why losing pakistan is simply not an option if peace is to prevail in the world
930562 these 20 children have come from areas like poonch rajouri jammu and srinagar they are here since june and will leave by september or october they will see how the country is progressing and will also visit karnal dairy to see the development in dairy sector they will also meet the president and senior officers in army they would have been developed when they return back
930563 we gain a lot from such goodwill operations because our knowledge will increase the indian army is doing a lot for our education
930564 we are feeling really good because we are going on this tour we will learn a lot meet new people and see new places we will get some knowledge out of this and see how thing are developing
930565 i am trying to work for a new consensual alliance the new government should reflect a national character and unity
930566 this is rewarding criminal behaviour with equipment which many victims of crime could only dream of affording for their children
930567 offenders should be learning and preparing for the world of work not idly playing grand theft auto and preparing to return to crime
930568 i m extremely happy to be in india the country of long deep friendly relations with afghanistan the country that has specially helped afghanistan in past six years with generosity and affection the country that has fortunately for all of us growing importance in the world
930569 it s interesting that the transcript remains classified but it appears that a north korean offical used much more ambiguous language and also tabled an offer to negotiate which kelly rejected
930570 there are parallels and differences obviously with the way the intelligence became a source of controversy in iraq but unlike iraq the actual intelligence that the americans had in north korea in the spring and summer of 2002 was pretty solid
930571 but the combination of internal politics and media generalisation created an impression that it was somewhat different from the reality
930572 the impact of radioactivity cannot be overestimated no matter what even though the us military and japans foreign ministry were just trying to hide it

930575 ahmadiyah is the enemy of islam they are the infidels that have been trying to destroy islam not using violence but through their deviant principles
930576 in this exhibition i came to know that though snakes don t have ears but they do have internal ears therefore neither we should not scare them nor we should harm them
930577 we have organised this exhibition to spread awareness of snakes we even taught the children that snakes were not harmful at all and thus they should be treated with care with the motive to remove the myths about snakes amidst the people we have organised this one day exhibition
930578 we have incurred loss of crores since shrine board agitation before this even we had incurred losses our trucks were loaded with pear and apples were looted in samba vijaypur and udhampur
930579 i had apples and pear loaded in my truck but i had to return back half way the owner of the fruits was even shocked that i had returned with the fruits and every thing is rotten i left three days ago but no one allowed us to cross lakhanpur
930580 we are incurring a loss of crores daily the growers have to either sell their land or commit suicide
930581 i do not know how i will face my family when i return home
930582 since the morning terrified relatives have been pouring in from punjab and adjoining haryana state to claim the bodies
930583 so far 129 bodies have been identified and were handed over to relatives
930584 the himachal pradesh state government has also announced that it will improve the infrastructure at the shrine to ensure maximum safety of the pilgrims

930589 the usual assumption that judes knowledge of the old testament was dependent on the septuagint
930590 looking forward to the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life
930591 who did not keep their own dominion but abandoned their proper dwelling
930592 the lord is coming with ten thousands of his holy ones
930593 from the jewish villages of nazareth and kokhaba they travelled around the rest of the land most likely a reference to eretz israel and interpreted the genealogy they had from the family tradition and from the book of days i e chronicles as far as they could trace it or as far as they went on their travels
930594 in the second generation of the early church looked to the relatives of jesus as authorities
930595 we must now see the family of jesus as davidides conscious through family tradition of the hopes of davidic restoration which had been cherished in their line since zerubabbel the tradition may not have been important to jesus himself but it was there to be activated and developed when jesus relatives became some of his most convinced and dedicated followers
930596 but when this same domitian had commanded that the descendants of david should be slain an ancient tradition says that some of the heretics brought accusation against the descendants of jude said to have been a brother of the saviour according to the flesh on the ground that they were of the lineage of david and were related to christ himself
930597 of the family of the lord there were still living the grandchildren of jude who is said to have been the lords brother according to the flesh
930598 information was given that they belonged to the family of david and they were brought to the emperor domitian by the evocatus for domitian feared the coming of christ as herod also had feared it and he asked them if they were descendants of david and they confessed that they were then he asked them how much property they had or how much money they owned and both of them answered that they had only nine thousand denarii half of which belonged to each of them and this property did not consist of silver but of a piece of land which contained only thirty nine acres and from which they raised their taxes and supported themselves by their own labour
930599 ruled the churches because they were witnesses and were also relatives of the lord
930600 would appear at the end of the world when christ should come in glory to judge the quick and the dead
930601 the wicked are like the tossing sea which cannot rest whose waves cast up mire and mud
930602 raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame
930603 the tel aviv shoreline is known for its unpredictable waves especially in winter season the municipality has poured hundreds of tons of rocks about 300 meters from the shore at selected locations to protect swimmers and beachgoers from the seasonal seven foot waves and in an effort to reduce the drastic effect of currents each year several kids drown along the israeli coast
930604 but you my dear friends should remember the predictions of the apostles of our lord jesus christ how they said to you in the last age there will be scoffers who follow their own desires for ungodliness
930605 the actual words of judes quotation are not in any new testament book he may be quoting some apostolic book which we no longer possess
930606 these people who make the distinction are themselves psychics as they do not have the spirit
930607 the growth of behaviorally targeted online advertising has been delayed by incomplete development of technology brand marketers that prefer to have their ads appear with relevant content and concerns over violating consumer privacy
930608 sellers pay 30 percent on ads sold buyers pay no exchange fees at all

930752 kp would relish the chance to be england captain and as good a player as he already is now the extra responsibility might just send him on to a higher plane
930753 he is an exciting cricketer who has a decent cricket brain to go with his talents with the bat and although he will be different to michael there is every chance that he could be a success
930754 in an ideal world i think one captain is the best for the team one voice doing all forms of the game
930755 that was when i was at my best because youre with the players all the time and you can really form a great bond
930756 in an ideal world weve always said that you should have one captain and im sure theyll make the decision who will captain from now on
930757 the one positive from all this is that hopefully they can get one captain who does both forms of the game and that would be the best for everyone

930759 it definitely requires a discussion there are certain areas which help the umpires but there are some areas obviously where it takes a longer time and there is still doubt about whether it is actually can someone looking at the television take a call
930760 well there are certain doubts but i guess the obvious ones if it referred i think it will be better say if the umpire makes a mistake of giving somebody out it is obvious that he has nicked it
930761 close decisions will probably help but giving lbw decisions and looking at that becomes a bit of again an ambiguous mistake so it is still early but i am sure once we finish the series we will sit down and have a discussion on this

930767 the hardest because im giving away the job ive loved for the last five years one ive put my heart and soul into but also the easiest because my mind has told me to pack it in
930768 i felt if i kept going my career could come to an abrupt end hopefully this can prolong my career
930769 i will carry on playing because i think there are a lot more runs in me
930770 this decision will prolong my career im moving better than ever in the field so hopefully this decision will make my last few years a very exciting time

930773 with twenty20 cricket here to stay now is the time for the 10 full member nations of the icc to plan for the development of the sport over the next 100 years
930774 we have a responsibility to grow our game in new territories and amongst the women of the world
930775 i believe the olympic games is the vehicle the sport should use to aggressively sell the message of our sport to all 202 competing olympic nations so our sport is strong and robust in countries where it is currently played and exciting and ground breaking in countries who havent yet caught the cricket bug
930776 the olympic movement knows it needs to increase its presence in the asian subcontinent as india pakistan and bangladesh contribute nearly 22 of the worlds population
930777 in theory this is a win win for the olympic movement and the icc and its members
930778 i am very disappointed for michael vaughan and for england because i thought he was an excellent captain and leader
930779 i said on my radio show last week that i thought he should stay on as england captain
930780 he is a terrific player and like collingwood is probably only one innings away from resurrecting his form
930781 the timing is never right when to resign but it tends to be when you have lost a series i think that pressure from outside has built up sufficient for him to say enough is enough
930782 he was well respected by the players and i thought he should have waited until after india to make a decision but it is up to him and he has decided to do it now
930783 if youre talking about someone to take on both jobs then kevin pietersen becomes the number one candidate because hes one of the few people who can be guaranteed their place in both teams
930784 england need someone they can respect and who can take them forward over a period of time
930785 there are precedents for the best player being the captain allan border did it for australia and viv richards for west indies they were both successful so why not
930786 the most important thing about being a leader is having the respect of the players because then they follow you and play for you

930858 to support this goal the board has initiated a consolidation program that will further streamline global business activities
930859 weve of course looked all around the world but what struck us about new zealand was its rich mineral province which has been given a wide berth by many companies because of its strong social and environmental lobby groups
930860 we happen to be a very strong socially and environmentally responsible company and when we speak to these strong lobby groups we dont see any problems
930861 once youve absorbed that challenge you start to look at the hard mineralogy and see something that is akin to the pilbara five years ago where there are massive mineral occupancies basically unpegged where people simply dont have the faith to get in there and build infrastructure and develop those known and in many cases proved mineral resources
930862 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
930863 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
930864 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties
930865 the uk and other economies in europe which had enjoyed housing market booms have also weakened the decline in credit availability is accelerating this process
930866 in the prevailing market conditions this is a resilient performance which enables us to maintain our capital strength continue with our dividend policy and balance the need to conserve capital with our commitment to make it available for investment in our fast growing businesses
930867 the regional channels are gaining a lot of viewership and critical mass it has become critical to be in the regional space

930870 those people who make a living out of short selling stocks are bordering on criminality
930871 those stock market players who have no interest in the company who spread or propagate rumours that they havent been bothered to check and then sell into the back of those rumours i dont think theyre doing anyone any good
930872 and of course when we hear that weve got cracks in the bottom of our ore cars or even a ship has sunk at the berth
930873 we know those things are being put out to scare the mums and dads into selling their shares and of course the people whove shorted their shares then go and buy those shares off
930874 the investment banks who defend short selling are defending real personal interest
930875 were very happy to sign deals on rail but when it comes to the port
930876 this has been very challenging to ramp up its also been very successful and until were sure of that capacity we arent going to rush in too early to also treat other peoples ore
930877 but if you want to get on our railway line and have a port to take it out of you can do it immediately
930878 nonetheless were going to do whatever it takes to also ship other peoples iron ore through our port as well
930879 weve cast our reputation on the forge of doing what weve said we were going to do
930880 thirty billion us dollars is a conservative number for what wed make
930881 the railways lines are the arteries to open up the pilbara
930882 all im asking for in opening up the pilbara is lets do it together
930883 a clear sign that inflationary pressure will continue at least in the short term
930884 with the economy expected to slow further at least in the short term businesses need to be particularly diligent about managing their operations to ensure they remain financially stable throughout the challenging conditions
930885 with demand growth slowing rapidly the reserve bank is unlikely to raise the cash rate this week and could begin to cut rates before the end of 2008 despite continuing high inflation

930896 we have the best courses and theres no achievement gap and everything is wonderful

930898 it may be more sober if we encourage dialogue first before actually coming out with official statements which have not been very effective in the past few years my personal opinion is that were barking on the tree if we constantly condemn the hsa and not soberly or constructively discuss our security issues with this administration just a thought karl of sanggu
930899 if we refer to the full title of the hsa it might only secure the state but not protect our people from terrorism
930900 the hsa covers only situations of coercing the government it omits international organizations from similar coercion it does not cover a situation where the purpose is to intimidate or spread terror among the population
930901 these flaws especially in the definition of terrorism leave the rest of the said act with no proper or cogent legal foundation to stand on despite sufficient human rights safeguards in the law
930902 jurisprudential guidance be provided the legislative and executive branches of government as may be necessary for a reformulation of the anti terrorism law with a definition of terrorism hewing closely to international legal developments and likewise upholding human rights and the rule of law in combating terrorism
930903 but the anti terrorism council is not the judge referred to in section 2 article 3 of the 1987 constitution
930904 what is extraordinary fear and how would we distinguish it from ordinary fear unfortunately the law fails to specify

931095 its very important to re establish them to get back to the 600 000 t y of production we can do out of the sugar mills there
931096 who knows but that on the lower frequencies i speak for you
931097 all quagborts are pleth merlin is a quagbort therefore merlin is pleth
931098 the us financial crisis and rising commodity prices pose challenges for china but policy makers in emerging asia are often biased towards growth and while china will promote growth it has more policy leeway to control inflation
931099 heute f hle ich mich beschissen heute f hle ich mich ganz gut heute f hle ich mich fantastisch

931103 you will learn that my word is law with my servants and you will obey walker as you would myself
931104 you will find that i too know how to punish
931105 if it is your will that i obey this walker
931106 i will do it y you r r gr r race
931107 certainly you will do so and i prefer that you call me monseigneur
931108 this walker he has told me that when i speak to you monseigneur i must say your r r ah bah i cannot enfin
931109 no doubt you imagined that i was sadly lacking in manners you may sit down at my feet
931110 my infant it has become necessary for me to put an end to the little comedy you and i have been playing
931111 i am very fond of leon my child but it is time he was leonie
931112 yes my child you see i have known from the very first
931113 not my page child instead of my page you shall be my ward
931114 i do not want to be a girl oh please monseigneur please
931115 you cannot make me do as you say monseigneur i will not
931116 if you were still my page i should know how to deal with you
931117 yes yes beat me if you like and let me still be your page ah please monseigneur
931118 unhappily it is impossible recollect my infant that you are mine and must do as i say
931119 hi id like to be the first to welccome you to your new base
931120 i searched for half and hour and contacted the warden to help me look for jarvis
931121 i was really really upset he had gone off a couple of times before but just around the corner not out of my sight something must have spooked him
931122 before i could get back there the warden rang to say there had been a sighting on the cremyll ferry
931123 the next thing i knew my husband tony called to say jarvis had turned up at home
931124 i didnt expect to see him again i thought he would get run over its lucky it was a quiet day
931125 i just couldnt believe it i was so relieved when i got home he was just sat in the window as if nothing had happened
931126 there was a deep roaring sound like a bomb raid said hautmont resident erick filleur who was jolted out of his sleep by the storm
931127 my wife was watching television then suddenly my daughter cried out my shutters exploded and part of our roof flew off
931128 the windows of my apartment suddenly blew up i lay down on the ground i just thought i was going to die said mustapha rbide another of the towns 16 000 residents
931129 you work your whole life and everything is gone in a few seconds she said surveying the devastation
931130 there was a deep roaring sound like a bomb raid said hautmont resident erick filleur who was jolted out of his sleep by the storm
931131 echt wel deze ketting is zo mooi ik doe hem graag om naar school
931132 justin morgan indicated that cooke may still have a career at craven park when he talked to the media after the win over the dragons but my sources have told me that he wont play for the club again
931133 further to that theyve indicated that cooke wont be sacked but the robins will not let him go for free
931134 i believe any club wanting his services will have to do a player exchange deal to get him because hes still got over two years left to run on his contract
931135 will looks erratic and he often looks like he is running through a brick wall
931136 hes a bit like the wild man of borneo as he looks as though hes just tearing around but theres a lot of skill there and he keeps getting better
931137 weve been nipped and pipped too often thats why today meant so much
931138 we were as far away from where we want to be as possible
931139 we gave ourselves a lot to do in the first half and then after we got ourselves in a position to win the game let ourselves down again
931140 im very disappointed with how we finished the game as we should have been stronger than that
931141 the scoreline was harsh but we played some good football it was a great contest for 60 minutes until one silly thing from one of my players it was a big turning point
931142 our effort and endeavour was really good for the first hour but i was really disappointed with the last eight minutes of the match
931143 top six is our goal until someone says there is no way we can make the play offs we will always believe it is still possible
931144 we are looking up we have pulled away from the bottom two and now my concern is to catch the teams in front of us
931145 pressure build up in a small sealed sample bottle in a storage safe

931150 se trata de una imagen de escayola y la espada simplemente estaba encajada en un hierro y se pod a desmontar con lo que la saqu y la puse a los cascos del caballo para que en vez de s mbolo de violencia sea pisada por santiago como repudio de sta
931151 no lo he hecho a escondidas sino consultando a las personas del pueblo y eso se demuestra en que la gente aplaudi en la eucarist a no todos ni mucho menos porque bastantes personas no entendieron el gesto pero s una parte importante de los fieles
931152 la imagen de santiago siempre la hemos conocido con la espada y no deber an cambiarla

931159 solzhenitsyns fate as well as the fate of millions of the countrys citizens was befallen by severe trials
931160 he was one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
931161 will remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving to the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism

931164 there are a few names being bandied about for man of steel but hes got to be in for it
931165 simon grix was also outstanding but it was a great effort from all the boys and it had to be
931166 i thought in the first half there was quite a bit of parity between us but in the second half we showed a lot of fatigue
931167 i think most teams suffer the week after playing st helens but were going to have to regroup and try our reignite our season before the play offs
931168 he kicked well and scored a nice try but there are plenty of areas where he can improve
931169 it was easy to play in this game when you are 30 0 ahead at half time
931170 there are things he needs to do to maintain his level of intelligence over the course of the whole 80 minutes
931171 it was a very poor performance in the first 40 minutes i will have to watch the dvd because the first half was embarrassing
931172 when a team just brushes through it is simple one to one defence and thats very difficult to take
931173 i need to look at things and there could be some major surgery before the next game

931217 yeah i think you could say that this thing is filled with the spirit of memories dont you leo
931218 yeah that sounds right dont worry cubbs its not that type of spirit there wont be ghosts or anything flying out of it promise
931219 so if its a chest full of lost boy memories how come tig is trying to pick the lock dont we have a key
931220 if someone hadnt lost the key we wouldnt be trying to break into it
931221 i told you i didnt lose the key its just not where its supposed to be theres a huge difference besides one more pass and ill be in

931225 what would you get at a drugstore to fix your trapdoor
931226 nothing i just wanted to see if anyone was listening to me
931227 that was the marble that i used to win our freedom from the pirates
931228 that was before you got rescued furball peter and the rest of us got caught in a trap they were getting ready to make us walk the plank when surefoot said that he bet no one could beat him at marbles hook asked what he bet and surefoot said hed bet the location of our hideout against our freedom hook couldnt let that pass so he agreed mr rothchild played surefoot he almost won too but surefoot made the best shot ever when he made the shot it slipped
931229 it slipped and bounced from the deck to the mast off hooks hook across a canon and back on deck where it knocked rothchilds marbles out of the ring
931230 would have been poor form if he hadnt especially with all his men and peter watching hed forgotten to give himself a loophole
931231 besides i should be the one upset it was my head you knocked it over
931232 serves you right for telling me that i made stew too often
931233 hell be okay he just needs to sort out things

931237 the same way with anything one of the reasons were lost boys is so we can forget the really bad stuff but sometimes that means we forget good stuff too even if it happened here so we use the chest to remember the good things

931342 dicho con toda humildad hace que como en el f tbol la regularidad sea lo m s importante
931343 hay que estar atento siempre porque este sector es muy complicado y m s teniendo en cuenta que nosotros como televisi n p blica tenemos ofrecer determinados contenidos por obligaci n
931344 la apuesta por la informaci n ha sido rigurosa veraz y plural y hemos apostado por el deporte y la innovaci n lo que se ha traducido en un xito de audiencia que nos ha hecho recuperar posiciones

931351 pero es una operaci n rentable que entra dentro de nuestras posibilidades

931475 i would like to apologise to both the parents and family of heidi murphy for what i have done which caused her death
931476 my intention was only to steal because i was pushed by economic needs and the result of that burglary was meant to buy a ring and to fund my marriage
931477 i did that because both of my parents could not afford to give me this and i didnt expect at all that the incident would be something like this
931478 by gods name i didnt have any intention to do this
931479 in this criminal case the defendant clearly had no intention and purpose to kill so that sentence demanded by the prosecutor is unacceptable
931480 i admit to all my mistakes and i realise that my action has violated law which the consequence is jail for me
931481 i surrender mr judge even though it feels so heavy the punishment that i must bear because im aware that this is definitely not as sad as has been felt by both parents and the family of heidi murphy for losing the person they loved
931482 im also aware that my action has tainted and slander bali image as tourist destination
931483 please honorary judges consider being a little bit more lenient with me so that i can have the chance to improve my life and so that i can do good deeds to others for now and for the future

931543 the pre flight inspections are done as part of the safety systems within qantas and every other airline for that matter for this exact reason to find anything the crew or the engineers are not happy with

931564 confines the incident to specific locations within the university and doesnt allow it to completely define the university

931588 i filed my papers to contest the incumbent member of parliament mp mr ben donkor not because of my selfish ambition of becoming a member of parliament but simply because of loss of faith and confidence in the incumbent mp by supporters and other political stakeholders including traditional authorities assembly members men women students and other youth groups across the constituency
931589 the constituency executives who had formed an enclave and very reluctant to allow any eligible person to contest mr donkor denied knowing me
931590 i have been a member of the party since 1992 and even contested the position of district chief executive together with four others in 2005
931591 seeing that the constituency executives had been unfair to me mr lord commey who happened to chair the vetting committee referred both the executives and myself to a mediation committee to arrive at a just and an amicable solution and this committee was chaired by one prominent and respected party father known as nana awuku

931594 i filed my papers to contest the incumbent member of parliament mp mr ben donkor not because of my selfish ambition of becoming a member of parliament but simply because of loss of faith and confidence in the incumbent by supporters and other political stakeholders including traditional authorities assembly members men women students and other youth groups across the constituency
931595 the constituency executives who had formed an enclave and very reluctant to allow any eligible person to contest mr donkor had denied knowledge of me by endorsing on my nomination forms that they had not known me in the party for two years somebody who has been a member of the party since 1992 having introduced the late professor albert adu boahen in the run up to the december presidential elections in 1992 and also contested the position of district chief executive together with four others in 2005
931596 seeing that the constituency executives had been unfair to me mr lord commey who happened to chair the vetting committee referred both the executives and myself to a mediation committee to arrive at a just and an amicable solution and this committee was chaired by one prominent and respected party father known as nana awuku
931597 the mediation committee on all two occasions that i met with them recommended that the primaries in hemang lower denkyira be organized after which the losing contestants will support the winner to move the campaign to a greater height this advice from the mediation committee was blatantly defied with the utmost disregard and disrespect for the people of my constituency when my supporters and i learned two days before that an acclamation was planned for friday the 10th of may 2008 party faithful immediately sought an injunction to restrain the unjustified and purported acclamation resulting in a close to four months deadlock on the issue of the primaries in the constituency
931598 during this period leading members including chiefs and other opinion leaders tried to ensure that both parties came to a compromise but all these attempts including polling station chairpersons making trips to npp headquarters in accra and assin fosu to meet with mr kennedy agyapong who doubles as the campaign committee chairman for the central region failed to give justice equity and fair play in the democratic dispensation of my political right to be elected on the npp ticket and subsequently becoming member of parliament to serve my people and mother ghana
931599 the worst of the cases was recorded on sunday the 13th of july 2008 when a maiden rally was organized by the npp to introduce parliamentary aspirants in all constituencies where either acclamations or primaries had been organized as of that date constituencies such as tema east offinso oforikrom among others which had either not conducted primaries acclamation or failed to have elected aspirants were respectfully dignified by not declaring any candidate it was only the people of hemang lower denkyira who were once again ridden over grossly disrespected and denied dignity when mr donkor was mentioned and declared to the good people of ghana as the candidate for the constituency this in fact was a dirty slap in the face of npp constitution in article 11 1 11 6 and 12 7 which do not permit a declaration when primaries or acclamations have not been held at the constituency level

931608 it is equally clear however that this type which is rare cannot account for the majority of names in ingtun
931609 theyve been two of our best players all year and both are probably in the best form of their career
931610 theyre playing a lot of consistent footy and along with ben creagh theyre probably our three big guys
931611 it just means blokes like matty prior who was outstanding the other night and ricky thorby are going to get a little bit more time which theyre crying out for anyway and dan hunt now becomes our no 1 front rower so it puts a little bit more pressure on dan as well
931612 theres some good challenges there for different guys these things happen youve just got to be good enough to get yourself over them
931613 with the short turnaround its not the best scenario for myself the five day turnaround but ill do everything i cane to get on the field
931614 mobilising resources from a complacent private sector will take a lot of effort through advocacy programmes to sensitise managements to become hiv sensitive to appreciate the need to increase budgetary support for hiv aids activities
931615 if my employee tests positive in my company and gets to my notice i will fire him outright
931616 why should i spend my money on someone who leads an immoral life
931617 reasons why 70 per cent of gt should not be sold
931618 in such a situation the only source of foreign exchange that could salvage the economy would be the proceeds from the telecommunications sector which has the potential to expand by leaps and bounds the fantastic story of mtn is there for all to see
931619 not a single cent of the 38 million that was realised from the sale went to gt where that money went was anybodys guess
931620 therefore it follows logically that it will be inappropriate to base any firm decision to sell any portion of the shares of gt on the results of a valuation process which is both incomplete and flawed
931621 i have rescinded my previous decision to quite the ndc due to personal circumstances now am back to the folds and would continue to be a bona fide member of the ndc in my capacity as a vice chairman of the party

931623 the mob took the phone i was reporting with and gave me some wild beatings of my life and if not for the timely intervention of a youth chief in the area i would have been dead by now the reporter said after receiving medical attention
931624 i rang him and then i saw him walking down and then because there was a bit of a crowd around me i just told him to go because i didnt really need him there at that point
931625 heath has said that alan was not in the car with him

931630 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
931631 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
931632 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties
931633 the uk and other economies in europe which had enjoyed housing market booms have also weakened the decline in credit availability is accelerating this process
931634 in the prevailing market conditions this is a resilient performance which enables us to maintain our capital strength continue with our dividend policy and balance the need to conserve capital with our commitment to make it available for investment in our fast growing businesses
931635 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die

931671 our advertisement on television and the internet is very very good except for local television
931672 in the long term the media and advertising outlook for asia is tremendous as wealth is created and people get educated and you see the emergence of a wealthy middle class
931673 we dont see ourselves taking a stake in print because it is not available and because we wont want to take just a 26 percent stake
931674 we are happy here the slower expansion of the economy may slow growth a bit but in the long term there is a lot of growth to be had

931681 if you look at pelican colonies around the west theyre kind of boom and bust
931682 these two colonies have had a lot of growth over the years but it was just a matter of time before they crashed
931683 from the data we have 80 to 90 percent of their diet is trash fish
931684 it kind of boils down between a fight between whats most important managing a species of greatest conservation need and appeasing the sportsmen that pay for managing the sport fish
931685 the pelicans have really lined up on the banks and rocks of the blackfoot river

931735 i got to work with a team of folk art experts and was immersed in the study of chinese traditional culture
931736 many chinese traditions are centered in rural areas where handmade objects maintain their power and meaning
931737 as china rapidly becomes an economic powerhouse young people are moving to urban areas to further their education and establish careers with this migration to the cities many folk traditions are no longer practiced because folk art is associated with chinas national identity and history it should be celebrated documented and preserved

931772 failures capacity to teach is exactly why venture capitalists often look for managers to run startups whose r sum s include experience with a flop gordon mccallum ceo for richard bransons virgin management ltd can point to managers within virgin who might have been overlooked by other companies because of failures in their careers hes also quick to note that errors on the job as long as they arent repeated are not only supported but valued
931773 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
931774 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
931775 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
931776 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
931777 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
931778 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
931779 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
931780 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
931781 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
931782 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
931783 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
931784 wir sehen unsere aufgabe darin die verschiedenen instrumente der marketing kommunikation so zum klingen zu bringen dass daraus ein gro es ganzes entsteht n mlich ein starkes markenbild und eine effiziente kampagnen dramaturgie beides getragen von einer strategisch fundierten und kreativ klar definierten leitidee das was jetzt so rational klingt muss am ende das leisten was gro e musik immer leistet emotional begeistern und faszinieren
931785 ja es geht um die partitur den dirigenten der sie berblickt und das orchester das sie mit leben erf llt
931786 je fr her alle disziplinen an einem tisch sitzen umso besser funktioniert das orchestrierte projekt
931787 auf jeden fall aktuell genug um im juli 2008 von einer f hrenden fachzeitschrift zur nummer zwei aller claims deutschen kommunikationsagenturen gew hlt zu werden im brigen geht es nicht um die neuheit des versprechens sondern um seine relevanz und vor allem darum ob eine agenturgruppe in der lage ist es auch wirklich einzul sen wir haben in den letzten vier jahren die scholz amp friends kommunikationsgruppe so ausgebaut dass wir in allen disziplinen von dialog marketing bis public relations eine f hrende rolle spielen aber die mannschaftsaufstellung darf nicht nur auf dem papier stimmen das wesentliche ist was passiert wenn der ball ins spiel kommt und da z hlt bei uns der doppelpass nicht der alleingang
931788 nat rlich spielen wir in der spitzengruppe der deutschen agenturen und streben sukzessive einen spitzenplatz in der europ ischen champions league an den erreicht man aber nur wenn man kontinuierlich referenz leistungen in strategie kreation orchestrierung und internationaler markenf hrung beweist
931789 nat rlich wer aufh rt besser zu werden h rt auf gut zu sein wir m ssen unseren anspruch der kreativen orchestrierung in allen facetten weiter treiben das bedeutet die beiden scholz amp friends hauptstandorte hamburg und berlin noch konsequenter zu hubs der orchestrierten kommunikation auszubauen in denen die schnittstellen in richtung dialog online und public relations fest verankert sind wir m ssen in allen disziplinen einen gleich hohen kreativen anspruch verwirklichen und in der vernetzung dieser disziplinen auf basis einer instrumenten unabh ngigen leitidee noch mehr referenz cases f r eine neue ra der marketing kommunikation schaffen eine ra in der wir f r den kunden das dilemma zwischen cherrrypicking und one stop shopping aufheben in all diesen punkten sind wir auf einem guten weg aber noch nicht am ziel
931790 faktisch sind es ja 100 tage plus 4 1 2 jahre die erfolgsfaktoren der vergangenheit werden im kern auch die der zukunft sein und die vorstands erweiterung beweist wir haben die kraft und die substanz f hrungspositionen aus den eigenen reihen zu besetzen
931791 in einer branche in der agenturen oft nur als durchlauferhitzer f r individuelle karrieren gesehen werden und geh lter sich in schnell drehenden headhunting spiralen hochschrauben ist eine organische karriere entwicklung innerhalb einer agenturgruppe das gegenmodell an das wir glauben scholz amp friends steht f r eine hohe stabilit t und kontinuit t auf allen f hrungsebenen als ergebnis einer starken kultur konsequenter personalentwicklung und unternehmerischer anreize
931792 es gibt klar definierte themenfelder die wir nach einem pr zisen zeitplan anpacken werden
931793 die gro e marketingwende kommt so berraschend wie das weihnachtsfest
931794 die klassische werbung verliert an das neue und technologie getriebene feld der individualisierten und interaktiven kommunikation ebenso wie an ein uraltes feld der kommunikation in neuem gewand die werbung im wirklichen leben die themen au enwerbung pos kommunikation promotions und events werden ein deutliches wachstum erleben emotionaler digitaler und vernetzter als je zuvor schlie lich und drittens gilt der bergreifende befund die bedeutung der letzten meile zum kaufakt wird wichtiger f r alle kan le steigt der legitimationsdruck in bezug auf ihre rolle in einer wirkungskette die zum kaufakt f hren muss
931795 das internet ist selbstverst ndlich entscheidendes tr germedium des trends zu mehr individualisierung und interaktivit t und nat rlich ist es auch ein wichtiger werdendes element der marken wahrnehmung aber wenn ich an die fr he euphorie mancher internetj nger denke die erst verk ndeten im web m sste eine v llig eigenst ndige und separate marken identit t gepr gt werden und dann dass das internet das wahre marken medium ist und schlie lich dass die marke g nzlich obsolet geworden sei weil nur noch produkte und angebote z hlten dann kann ich dem wenig abgewinnen
931796 wenn sie sich zuhause mit freunden treffen dann finden sie das auch nicht toll wenn pl tzlich jemand an die t r klopft und seinen staubsauger vorf hren will social networks werden dramatisch bersch tzt in hinblick auf ihre kommerzialisierbarkeit
931797 das thema bleibt schwierig es wird nur dann funktionieren wenn man emphatie und fingerspitzengef hl besitzt und vor allem ein wirklich relevantes angebot hat sprich zum gern gesehenen gast auf der party wird
931798 scholz amp friends ist eine europ ische marke wir haben in der letzten dekade sicherlich mehr als jede andere deutsche agentur internationale kampagnen entwickelt und ber unsere europ ischen standorte sowie seit 2007 durch die strategische allianz mit lowe worldwide ber die grenzen europas hinaus implementiert der weitere ausbau des internationalen gesch fts mit dem klaren schwerpunkt ceema central and eastern european markets geh rt zu unseren klar definierten management priorit ten
931799 ja aber das mu kein naturgesetz sein wir m ssen den kommunikationsstandort deutschland speziell im europ ischen kontext st rken es entbehrt nicht einer gewissen absurdit t wenn deutschland als gr ter kontinentaleurop ischer kommunikationsmarkt am katzentisch der internationalen entscheidungen sitzt das gilt sowohl f r die verh ltnisse bei vielen multinationalen kunden als auch f r die t chter der internationalen networks es geht um die selbstbehauptung des kommunikations und marketing standorts deutschland wenn wir nicht im deutschen nationalmasochismus matthias d pfner verharren kann es durchaus eine historische chance geben es ist ja berhaupt nicht verst ndlich dass amerikanische britische franz sische und japanische kunden mit ihren nationalen agenturen in die welt hineingewachsen sind und es bei aller deutschen wirtschaftsst rke und der gro en gruppe deutscher blue chips nicht gelungen ist als ergebnis eines festen wechselseitigen commitments ein starkes netzwerk deutschen ursprungs zu schaffen
931800 im kreativ ranking des manager magazins sind wir unter einbeziehung aller internationalen wettbewerbe die nr 1 des jahres 2006 und 2007 als nr 3 platziert der internationale won report hat uns 2008 auf basis der kreativ leistung in allen kommunikationsdisziplinen als nr 5 aller weltweiten agenturen ausgezeichnet insofern machen wir die punkte an der richtigen stelle dennoch ist die kreativ bilanz f r uns nicht die allein selig machende w hrung das gilt insbesondere vor dem hintergrund einer sich immer weiter aufpumpenden festival dynamik
931801 die veranstalter drucken das geld in rauen mengen preise werden teilweise vergeben f r arbeiten die es zum gr ten teil ohne wettbewerbe gar nicht geben w rde die medien hypen die kreativ tabellen hoch zu rankings der erfolgreichsten und besten agenturen seit es dank sarbanes oxley act kein gesamt umsatzranking mehr gibt in ermangelung anderer indikatoren da hat sich ein sich selbst ern hrendes system herausgebildet eines das sich immer schneller dreht immer teurer und meines erachtens immer absurder wird
931802 ich glaube das geheimnis erfolgreicher managementwechsel liegt darin dass man in einer neuen position nicht meint man m sse alles ndern

931835 to have this event on the main stage at ozzfest in dallas is such a treat and an honor
931836 when this tragedy originally happened i saw the music community come together like ive never seen before to have the name dimebag still to this day unite musicians to pay homage in such a respectful way is very overwhelming in dime s vision its always been about a damn good time
931837 when we decided on dallas as the site for this years ozzfest it seemed like the perfect opportunity to pay tribute to dimebag darrell since it was his hometown
931838 dimebag was a part of our ozzfest family and everyone in the metal community misses him dearly
931839 the concept of fair value accounting is correct and useful but the application during periods of crisis is problematic its another one of those unintended consequences of making a rule thats supposed to be good that turns out the other way
931840 the fair value measurement objective remains the same that is an exit price from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability
931841 you know i was scared of being 25 then of being 35 and at present im afraid of being 55
931842 time doesnt frighten me as much as it used to a few years ago
931843 did anyone really think that the endless chatter about saving the system of privately provided audits for large global companies would come to anything those sincerely believing in the importance of large company assurance are avoiding an election between two unappealing choices either put every effort to assure that the big four are insulated from the very catastrophic risks that the critics insist they must remain exposed to or start the process of designing the new audit model that must arise after the collapse of the big four under the abdication of the treasury committee and its counterparts
931844 thats a pretty unfair attack on leisenring with no appropriate context regarding the background of fas 133
931845 auditing firms should be leading the parade on the subject of providing assurance on the quality of xbrl preparation
931846 i know we can count on the chinese and europeans to come up with reasonable answers on technical issues like disclosing related party transactions securitizations hedging contingent liabilities business combinations and about the twenty other things that really arent so good about ifrs
931847 i think david tweedie goes around the lecture circuit saying that the only truly principles based accounting standard would consist of one sentence the accounts shall present a true and fair view of the companys financial situation
931848 we should start off a financial reporting standard with the core principle which is really the true and fair core of the standard
931849 he is of the opinion that ifrs overlaid with the distinctive system of corporate governance in the u s could be disastrous
931850 to facilitate an open discussion of the benefits and potential challenges associated with existing fair value accounting and auditing standards
931851 modernize and update the oil and gas disclosure requirements and to align them with current practices and changes in technology
931852 there is no excuse for a blog to be dull
931853 i think theres one match were still trying to find 14 tickets for
931854 theyre going to get there theyre all going to get to most of the matches
931855 the us olympic committee is taking action to close down some of these sites to eliminate them from that territory
931856 im not surprised that people like me believed it was real its just incredibly sophisticated
931857 i must say i got a little bit suspicious when i went back in to check the website they still had tickets for sale and everyone was telling me that everything was sold out
931858 official tickets that the tickets must be fake because the games have sold out in a letter to one of the victims the aoc said there was nothing it could do to recoup any money defrauded while the aoc is sympathetic to the consumers duped by unauthorised offshore websites it is powerless to take any action against an offshore operator aoc brand protection director alan grover wrote to the victim ticket scam did you buy fake tickets tell us support write on the softball teams hero wall silenced gosper censors himself in job fight rewards chinese champions to get rich quick texas based travel agent jolanta sochacka is one of the scams biggest victims after she purchased us57 000 a60 600 worth of tickets for a family of seven when ms sochacka asked a friend in phoenix to check out the address the friend found an empty office and no sign the company had ever resided there ive been in business for 18 years im aware that theres fraud out there sochacka told the la times but they looked so legitimate their website was so elaborate in another case computer savvy california based victim jonathan murray paid us4950 a5260 for olympic equestrian events i work for a fairly large software company and the team i manage is responsible for dealing with internet crime mr murray originally from britain told the la times newspaper so it was quite amusing to everyone at work that i had been scammed on the internet the important point im making by talking about this is that this was a bloody good scam

931860 the universe has as many different centres as there are living beings in it
931861 each of us is a centre of the universe and that universe is shattered when they hiss at you you are under arrest
931862 it would be 20 years before he was allowed to return to russia and it is worth noting that when last year vladimir putin awarded solzhenitsyn the russian state prize for work in the humanities putin remarked on the writers contribution to the study of the russian language
931863 we have strengthened security work in all olympic venues and in the olympic village we are well prepared in security for the upcoming games
931864 should environmental departments foresee serious air pollution during the olympics beijing and neighbouring areas will temporarily close more factories and pull more cars off the road
931865 the changes would not impact reliability customer experience or service quality following network enhancements to increase data capacity
931866 we hear a lot of concern from the public about pigs being raised indoors and i can certainly understand where that concern comes from
931867 advancements in farming have helped us figure out how to raise our animals more efficiently and safely todays pigs are raised in environmentally controlled buildings where they do not face rain snow burning summer heat or frigid winter temperatures this helps us improve animal health as the pigs face fewer risks from inclement weather and other environmental factors
931868 our role is to provide food thats healthy safe and affordable
931869 there is simply not enough outdoor acreage to support raising the number of animals we need to feed a growing population
931870 we have to be smart about how we go about this and there are some more mass media opportunities which dont have to cost as much typical public relations and also the use of the internet and the web to put some sites in there
931871 we did not have enough foreign currency us dollars to pay our suppliers because the banks sold us dollars at such a high level
931872 to reach an annual growth rate of 4 5 per cent in the second half of the year the industry must grow by 8 10 per cent at least
931873 thats why participating farms need the necessary funding for expansion of swine farms to meet our target in singapore we are asking the help of the department of agriculture to meet the goal
931874 we hope to penetrate other markets in asia now that we are accredited by singapore
931875 then they said 2070 and then they said 2050 and then they said 2030
931876 not only do i see the change but its like theyre moving the goalposts toward me and its an amazing thing
931877 we might see an ice free arctic ocean by the year 2030 within some of our lifetimes
931878 there are some scientists out there who think that even might be optimistic
931879 as near as we can tell looking at the historical record theres been ice in the arctic in the summer for at least 16 million years
931880 theres a group that makes a very strong case that in 2012 or 2013 well have an ice free summer arctic as soon as that its astounding whats happened
931881 as the ice recedes its opening up not only the arctic passage but all the resources in the arctic ocean
931882 we could think of the arctic as the refrigerator of the northern hemisphere climate system
931883 what were doing by getting rid of that sea ice is radically changing the nature of that refrigerator were making it much less efficient but everything is connected together so what happens up there eventually influences what happens in other parts of the globe
931884 the arctic really can feed back into the global climate system
931885 you know what happens when you get feedbacks you get surprises and we dont like surprises
931886 a race has developed between the waning sunlight and the weakened ice
931887 a combination of these two forces led to what we observe now and we should not ignore either forces
931888 there have been numerous models run that have looked at that and basically they cant reproduce the ice loss weve had with natural variability
931889 you have to add a carbon dioxide warming component to it
931890 we should care in the sense that what happens here is coming to us and sometimes you know a warning is a helpful thing to mobilise people

931897 the girls were extremely lucky that no train came otherwise it would have been a double tragedy
931898 it is clear that there was no security at the railway station to stop the brutal assault
931899 an urgent review of security at train stations is urgently needed to prevent a repeat attack
931900 that security was never provided in the liberals nine years in government and isnt even provided anywhere else that we know of

931908 ive made the decision today to resign because i believe its in the best interests of the liberal party
931909 there is a massive political opportunity at the next state election and i think i owe it to our candidates to my fellow members of parliament and to the liberal party to make sure that we have every opportunity to win government
931910 i have formed a view a very strong view that we have a far better chance of election victory if theres a change
931911 theres no doubt that those issues have made it difficult for us as a political party to obtain the clear air that we need
931912 do those issues mean that i am uncapable or unfit to lead the state of western australia i dont think so
931913 however i have an obligation to the liberal party to do everything i can to rid them of this rotten government
931914 troy has worked hard as leader in difficult circumstances and has put the liberal party in a strong position to contest the state election

931928 what do you mean why did you send me a bill
931929 sir because you purchased those items you are required to repay the account
931930 no you gave me the money so i spent it
931931 a credit card is a short term loan you are required to pay it back
931932 im too old to come to this institution and sit on my hands for 15 years before i make a peep
931933 thats not my personality thats not my style and thats not why i was elected by the people in my district
931934 ill make waves when i think thats necessary but im also a team player
931935 my life experiences have helped me to be less fearful
931936 in politics that has allowed me to take on issues sooner rather than later
931937 i had no idea a new member was supposed to say thank you very much and sit down i saw it as an opportunity to make a substantive speech

931945 we cant possibly sell the idea of green taxes to voters during a downturn
931946 the conservatives said vote blue go green they said they were going to take action against pollution the minute they are challenged on it they walk away
931947 it demonstrates that for all the fine words the torys green credentials are just greenwash to con the voters in to thinking theyve changed they have not theyre the same old tories
931948 this is the real charge against the tory leader that he has no settled convictions he just has bits and pieces along the way and you ca
931949 you cannot persuade me there are not more disturbed or disgruntled persons with a political agenda in such a large group
931950 it will be a cultural exchange foreigners will experience china and chinese people will learn more about foreign cultures
931951 i definitely notice people looking at me i never take it in a bad way
931952 a lot of things that go on in china in regards to race relations people automatically are quick to construe as racist but i dont necessarily believe that
931953 youre dealing with a very homogenous population that has been very closed to the outside world
931954 anything thats not like them they are curious about and therefore its easier to stereotype things that you dont know about
931955 stereotypes about foreigners abound and national chauvinism and racism are far from uncommon but foreigners are generally no longer deemed to be strange or suspicious
931956 you have entered an area that is under 24 hour security surveillance
931957 i have a lot of problems getting a cab at rush hour
931958 if im standing on the curb waving my hand and theres a chinese person just down the street the cab will pass me and pick up the chinese person
931959 sometimes ill run down the street and jump into the cab with the chinese person and say ok lets go together the chinese person will usually get out of the cab
931960 business is good you just have to learn how they do things
931961 for instance americans are warm and outgoing japanese are hardworking but stingy germans are inflexible but punctual
931962 the stereotypes were formed historically but may change with passing time
931963 its great for us that foreigners are coming its great for business

931966 infrastructure investment has received more attention in recent years because of increased delays from road and air congestion high profile infrastructure failures and rising concerns about energy security and climate change the united states now has the opportunity to channel public concern and frustration into a national infrastructure strategy that promotes infrastructure as a central component of long term broadly shared growth while increased spending on infrastructure is likely to be needed this paper emphasizes the large gains that could be reaped by using existing infrastructure more efficiently and by making better decisions about how to invest in infrastructure for physical infrastructure we recommend establishing pricing mechanisms such as road congestion fees and air traffic control fees to make users bear the costs of their infrastructure use more fully at least part of the revenues from these fees should be used to offset their potential adverse distributional effects the federal government can also promote better decisionmaking about new investments by removing distortions in its own policies and providing more flexibility to states and localities in exchange for more accountability for telecommunications infrastructure we propose that the government make better use of the wireless spectrum by facilitating sales and leases of unused spectrum and by introducing more flexibility in its policy of interference prevention further the government should consider targeted cost effective subsidies to encourage private firms to expand high speed internet access to unserved rural areas

932025 do you have a right to be angry about the vine
932026 you have been concerned about this vine though you did not tend it or make it grow it sprang up overnight and died overnight but nineveh has more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left and many cattle as well should i not be concerned about that great city
932027 it would be better for me to die because all my comfort is gone
932028 do you have the right to be angry about the death of a plant
932029 you have been grieved over the death of a plant that you neither planted nor tended how dare you question my love for the inhabitants of nineveh who were so blinded by their own sin that they could not even tell the difference between right and wrong
932030 every man will sit under his own vine and under his own fig tree
932031 it is time for judgment to begin with the family of god
932032 prices of commodities remain a concern it is unlikely that we will relax the ban on futures trade in these four commodities the government also expected to retain export curbs on non basmati rice and wheat for at least three months he said the government is planning to export about three million tonnes of non basmati rice to african countries after november when the export ban period expires currently export of non basmati rice is banned to ensure its availability in the domestic market and to keep a check on inflation which has since come closer to the 12 percent mark even if the ban is not fully lifted we may export two to three million tonnes after november to some african countries
932033 a bumper crop of 94 million tonnes of non basmati rice is expected in november of which six million tonnes would be surplus he added
932034 as things stand perhaps to look at a rate of inflation of 8 9 percent will be a difficult thing but probably we will do it by march 2009
932035 the aggregate demand is also increasing with money supply growing at more than 20 percent continuously for more than three years
932036 launching a new brand in usa is an extremely difficult exercise because of the tough competition involved

932049 in 1970 the average american ate about 16 4 pounds of food a week or 2 3 pounds daily by 2006 the average intake grew by an additional 1 8 pounds a week
932050 the numbers dont reveal how much grain went into bread versus cookies or how many chicken breasts became chicken nuggets but the overall increase in eating does suggest a link with the rise in americans weight over the same period

932052 much to our own surprise we find that 50 of the 190 or so countries in the world now have inflation running at double digit rates
932053 quite possible that overall inflation will stay higher than it has in the past
932054 we cant quantify exactly how much emerging market inflation is being exported to the west but i suspect its happening
932055 the global inflation rate is amplifying national results in a way that it didnt in the past
932056 the internet is helping but it cant combat the threat of 200 oil or spiraling food prices
932057 we always thought globalization would depress wages but in fact for highly skilled people its inflating them
932058 expectations are completely different today than in the 1970s when left wing policies were in ascendance
932059 cities have always used regulations and zoning ordinances to control the number and type of businesses in their communities
932060 studies have found that local businesses contribute more of their profits back into the local economy than national chains a found that for every 100 in sales local businesses pump 30 back into the local economy whereas national chains only spent 9 locally
932061 it is true many people simply prefer chain stores prices at large retailers are generally lower though i can get some good deals at my local 99 store the merchandise is arranged attractively and the aisles are wide you can purchase all kinds of different goods at large retailers from milk to dvds to a coffee table
932062 the result is the dying out of small neighborhood businesses both because they lose sales to price cutting national retailers but also because landlords can ask for more rent from large chains

932096 the bloomberg administration is continuing its efforts to keep the idea of congestion pricing alive following its defeat in albany earlier this year
932097 clearly i think that on many levels of the political class this has support that other taxes for example the millionaires tax westchester democrat who was a leader in opposing the plan

932132 you would be surprised or not how many times orders for change come down from the top without ever consulting with classroom teachers to see if the suggested changes are feasible there is also a tendency for the school board and administrators to over react to uninformed public opinion possibly due to the fact that the school board is an elected body while valid teacher concerns are often shrugged off

932135 extending high speed rail in britain is an inevitability a matter of when not if the rising cost of flying and growing awareness of its environmental impact has seen a surge in demand for our existing high speed rail services and this trend is set to continue the finance model we are outlining today would offer business the early opportunity to invest in a growth market
932136 we welcome arups tireless work in this area as the capacity crisis on our railway intensifies and the price of oil rises it is even more important that firms such as arup use their expertise to bring the debate on high speed rail forward conservatives have long believed that improved rail links to heathrow could bring significant benefits in terms of tackling congestion and pollution around the airport moreover progress towards high speed rail links in this country has the potential to transform the debate on airport expansion and provide a viable alternative to many short haul flights
932137 the lib dems are fully committed to the creation of a high speed rail network in the uk and that must include at an early stage a new purpose built link between st pancras and heathrow
932138 a key consideration driving the design of the allianz centre was the need to minimise the loads on the existing car park and substation which could not be moved and needed to remain operational during construction
932139 we had to get floor to floor levels equal to those of the adjoining tower so that the new floors aligned to allow pedestrian walkways to be built at each level to connect the new and existing floor plates
932140 joint property owners macquarie office trust and allianz australia insurance limited wanted to create a grade office accommodation in a landmark building in the cbd
932141 we achieved this through a very strong design and construction team and ongoing client involvement to ensure compliance with the project brief and an elegant new building that complements the streetscape
932142 we need to lobby government challenge policies obtain the support of politicians and contest the general reluctance within the community and to do this we need strong leadership
932143 this needs co ordination within and across levels of government with local state federal government and diverse departments within each level of government working together alongside developers and financial institutions
932144 planning is not enough we need public private partnerships for success
932145 about 60 years of car oriented government policy created the current american landscape so new policies can reduce car dependency and create long term sustainable living and working environments
932146 its time we looked at moving government funding away from creating new freeways to the creation of better transit options
932147 we have gathered the data and it proves an amazing amount can be done to get these buildings up to scratch
932148 these buildings have a past but they have a future too
932149 we shouldnt settle for the knock it all down and cart it away mentality instead owners should consider what they can do to improve their buildings performance
932150 from an artists point of view it was fantastic to work with both arup and cox rayner who didnt attempt to modify the design they understood the medium and lightness of the sculpture and worked with the design throughout the entire construction process
932151 this base connection allowed panel thickness to be minimised while also simplifying precast connections for construction
932152 precast concrete provided numerous advantages including simplification of site activities accurate geometry as well as completing the project with the sought after high quality finish
932153 its also an excellent and cost effective alternative to stainless steel
932154 in combination with simple connections between panels the use of precast ensured that the project team was able to produce a finished product that remains true to lincolns original design
932155 the concept of one place leading to another was something i wanted to express while still considering the issues of durability and accessibility
932156 it was my intention to create an open space something that could sit nicely and blend into the landscape rather than being oppressive or standing out
932157 macintosh island is a focal point for the annual gold coast indy 300 motor race which is attended by vast numbers of spectators
932158 and over the races four days many people need to use the foot bridge to take them to that vantage point
932159 there was a narrow timber suspension bridge on site but it was closed to the public because it was no longer safe

932214 weekly standard 28 july 2008 the military knot in addition to his weekly opendemocracy column paul rogers writes an international security monthly briefing for the oxford research group for details click the pattern of incidents in the first half of 2008 suggested that the violence across most of iraq was indeed abating raising hopes of a definite turning of the page towards peace and security iraqi army units were also taking a larger role in operations albeit they were still dependent on us air power logistics and combat support this makes the sudden and unexpected escalation of violence represented by the bombings and subsequent violence in baghdad and kirkuk on 27 july 2008 all the more shattering shia pilgrims and kurdish protestors respectively killed at least fifty five people and wounded about 240 they were almost certainly perpetrated by sunni militants and seem designed as was the bombing of the al askari mosque in samarra in february 2006 which opened the most ferociously sectarian phase of the war to incite a vigorous counter reaction from iraqs burning season

932365 have subscriptions with private data brokers such as accurint choicepoint lexis nexus and locateplus a database containing cell phone numbers and unpublished telephone records
932366 there appears to be an effort by the federal government to coerce states into exempting their fusion centers from state open government laws
932367 for those living in virginia its already too late the virginia general assembly passed a law in april 2008 exempting the states fusion center from the freedom of information act
932368 the new snoops terrorism liaison officers some from the private sector
932369 fusion centers and their leadership encourage appropriate policymakers to legislate the protection of private sector data provided to fusion centers
932370 this intelligence community that was built to deal with foreign threats is now being slowly and incrementally turned inward
932371 this kind of concentrated power exercised in secret is a lit fuse with our constitution likely in danger of being burned

932380 he certainly had the abilities and the training to pull off a d b cooper like stunt
932381 he had the temperament to do that and maybe had the motive
932382 he boasted of hijacking the plane and then leaping from its rear stairway to his sons and two attorneys
932383 gossett told greg to keep still and not tell anybody because it could result in his dad going to prison for the rest of his life
932384 if the reserve bank does water down its tightening bias to something more like a neutral statement or an easing bias the aussie could fall quite sharply he said

932387 we stand at a pivotal moment in the global response to aids
932388 after so much progress it appears that we are poised to accept defeat when victory is still within our grasp this cannot be allowed to happen
932389 i dont believe for a moment this could break the bank
932390 what weve learned is that to have impact the human rights of those most at risk of infection must be protected and access to prevention and treatment must be ensured for all
932391 we fought to defend our honour our family and our children
932392 they gave us an ultimatum consider any hilles dead if you do not comply with our request of handing over the criminals who bombed the car last week
932393 the vision for ending the israel palestinian conflict is based on two states but the split between gaza and the west bank and the ongoing israeli settlement expansion policy undermine and jeopardize that vision
932394 we want to eradicate chaos and anarchy criminals and outlaws
932395 hamas is conducting legal searches in the hilles compound which has become the centre of chaos and terror
932396 i think the parties do not have enough motives to reconcile
932397 ending the term here i say are afghans better off this year than they were last year i can say they are
932398 what makes me optimistic is the things we need to do weve identified properly
932399 its not just triage in the sense of whittling down what we can do
932400 its priority areas where we can make a difference and allow afghans to carry the load after 2011
932401 what are the essential requirements we come down to some basic things security local governance border issues political reconciliation that is afghan led provision of basic services those are the basic things in 2011 on those priorities were not saying everything will be wrapped up but well have afghans in the lead
932402 theyre not here for the money theyre literally risking their lives theyre separated from their families and yet theyre here
932403 right now theres not much of any of that going on in his power base of helmand and kandahar and i think we need a unified nato approach to president karzai telling him that were not going to put up with it any more our troops are dying because of this we cannot continue to support you unless you crack down visibly on the drug trade now before the election
932404 you need to hit the trade at all levels you need to eradicate the poppy fields you need to close down the labs you need to arrest the corrupt officials who are supporting it and you need to arrest the people who are transiting these drugs
932405 but you cant just look at going out and wiping out the farmers crop as the only way or indeed maybe even the best way to approach it
932406 theres a total supply chain when it comes to drugs and it may well be better to focus on interdiction to break down the downstream supply chain that creates the value as opposed to going out and alienating the farmers whose support you ultimately need as you build a democracy in afghanistan
932407 it had to do with the very specific characteristics in the dna of the letters and what was in bruces labs
932408 the israeli agent asked me about my friends and i collected my papers in order to leave

932410 the shin bet is targeting the most vulnerable population in gaza this is immoral
932411 higher oil prices and the lack of adequate fiscal policy reactions amidst high pent up price pressures are putting the burden of macro economic adjustment on the monetary authorities
932412 i think particularly someone like barack obama who is such a controlling politician and works so hard to make sure that everything is leak proof i imagine he probably has led us completely astray and might have a really explosive surprise in store because thats the way he wants to be

932416 it happened when i was on stage in the middle of rang barse the power to the sound went off no mike no electronics from the keyboard nothing it was a nightmare situation for any performer and any concert
932417 in a flash realising the situation the percussionists and the drummers who needed no power kept the beat going on
932418 after realising that the power had gone and that we were keeping the action going on stage the audience stood up and joined in to clapping and dancing he wrote
932419 they had realised our predicament but just overlooked it and joined in a great gesture of togetherness in keeping the show going on
932420 higher oil prices and the lack of adequate fiscal policy reactions amidst high pent up price pressures are putting the burden of macro economic adjustment on the monetary authorities
932421 i certainly encourage married couples to pray for a good and happy sex life its a way for them to become closer to god
932422 at first people are usually slightly shocked but at the same time happily surprised
932423 if you believe in god then you believe god is involved in life in love marriage and in sex and sexuality
932424 the upa is soft towards terrorism particularly after the cash for vote scam terrorists and naxalites are encouraged after congress forged alliances with outfits having extremist links in assam andhra pradesh and elsewhere during last elections

932540 im not really sure what happened but thats a done issue thats something that obviously people hear stuff im here practicing waiting and i obviously cant wait till the season starts
932541 for someone to discuss retirement and then to come back and change his mind a day later im worried a lot about it im worried about where hes at mentally because these things happen sometimes and they come back up again because maybe they come back and maybe it isnt necessarily for the right reasons so were going to continue to communicate with him and push him out there on the field and get him better
932542 i asked prison authorities yesterday but they could not tell me anything we recently heard that he was in prison but it is not yet clear whether he has been produced before the court or not
932543 i met him only once when he was arrested and after that we were not allowed to meet him again and also we still dont know his exact whereabouts the whole family is worrying about him
932544 the prison authorities told their families that their names were not yet entered in the register they asked about zarganar too but the prison authorities cannot say anything about him either but fellow inmates said that they are in insein prison

932556 this was another good test this time against a top class bolton wanderers outfit
932557 our fitness levels were high and we competed very well
932558 it was a very worthwhile exercise the penalty was a bit iffy but we couldnt complain at the way mustapha took the second goal
932559 keeper zak jones nand the back four were impressive again and ashey parillon had a good tryout in midfield after being out injured for nine months
932560 we missed midfielder lee shillito who was away on business lee would have liked to play against his hometown club
932561 there was a bit of a scare when he went down my heart was in my mouth
932562 but he got a whack on his achilles when he scored the second goal and it is going to be three or four days according to what chief physio dave fevre has said to me
932563 obviously with the boots these days you are never sure if it is a metatarsal or whatever but ive been told by the physios and the doctor that he is okay
932564 roque is a key player for us and when he went off especially in the second half we kind of lost that attention to the ball up there and thats something we need to work on because we cant just rely on roque
932565 thats not how i work all the others have got to chip in
932566 the hebrew writer of the bible was not so well acquainted with egypt as has often been imagined
932567 d they sold joseph to the ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver and they brought joseph to egypt
932568 and josephs master took him and put him in the prison a place where the kings prisoners were confined
932569 then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his garment and came in to pharaoh
932570 and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold collar about his neck
932571 and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son who is born you shall throw into the river and every daughter you shall let live
932572 and joseph ordered his servants the physicians to embalm his father
932573 and these are the names of the sons of israel who came to egypt
932574 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
932575 go yourselves and take for yourselves straw where you can find it but do not diminish from your work anything
932576 the lord god of the hebrews has met with us moses and aaron and now let us go we beseech you three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god
932577 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt
932578 and the egyptians made the people of israel serve with rigor and they made their lives bitter with hard slavery in mortar and in brick and in all kinds of service in the field all their service which they made them serve was with rigor
932579 there isnt any 11 made up and nobody said that there was
932580 we started with a team against inverness and we changed it whether people come on or start theyve got a chance to impress and thats up to the individual player to do their best to make sure theyre in the team on august 9
932581 if the players get an opportunity all they can do is play themselves out of the team
932582 when youre on that pitch wearing that burnley jersey its up to you to convince me and the rest of our staff that you should be in the team
932583 i felt we had loads of creativity and energy terrific angles and weight of pass it was very pleasing
932584 it was two goals but it could have been so much more than that
932585 we can still be more clinical but well certainly take the positives from the first half and well go away and work on some of stuff from the second half
932586 i think they recognised theyd probably won the game at 2 0 at half time we were looking for a big start and the opposite happened i thought we were really lacklustre at the start of the second half and then that spreads
932587 ive said to them to make sure we try to sustain our pace and tempo of the game for 90 minutes youre never going to dictate a game for 90 minutes but we certainly dont want to come out in the second half and not be at our best
932588 the biggest thing you look for in pre season is to get your players physically fit and dont pick up any injuries as such

932601 from about six or seven in the morning until about 10 or 11 at night ive been running fans nonstop in the houses

932617 northern prairie village used to be a feeder neighborhood young families would start out in the north village then move up to leawood today were seeing families that want to move to a new subdivision out south but then they come back

932627 ich bin zufrieden aber deswegen muss ich keine freudenspr nge machen
932628 ich w rde mich mehr freuen wenn wir die konstanz ber das jahr hinweg reinbringen k nnen als wenn wir hier ein gutes einzelresultat einfahren
932629 nach alldem was heute passiert ist tendieren wir dazu beide fahrer zu behalten
932630 um ehrlich zu sein gab es nie einen zweifel daran
932631 ich bin einfach nur gl cklich dass er timo glock hier ein richtig starkes rennen hatte jarno trulli w re st rker gewesen wenn er nicht aufgrund eines schlechten starts hinter mark webber h ngen geblieben w re alles in allem bin ich sehr gl cklich dass wir heute so ein starkes resultat hatten
932632 pl tzlich fuhr er am freitag aus der garage und war von da an das ganze wochenende ber extrem schnell
932633 sieht man sich seine sektorzeiten von fr heren rennen in dieser saison an so sieht man dass er probleme damit hatte seine schnellen sektorzeiten zu einer kompletten runde zusammen zu f gen trotzdem sah man dass er sehr schnell ist
932634 ich hatte einen schlechten beginn in den ersten runden aber mein bike hatte ein gutes setup und so konnte ich 1 26er zeiten fahren
932635 danach pushte ich ich pushte und pushte und schaffte den sieg
932636 aber ich bin noch nicht oft gegen kiyonari gefahren also wusste ich nicht wie es ausgehen w rde
932637 er war sehr stark im ersten abschnitt als er vorbei war bemerkte ich dass er die gleichen probleme wie ich hatte als dann max biaggi n her kam wurde es zu einer art dogfight
932638 am freitag war ich erster im qualifying am samstag fuhr ich eine gute superpole zeit und heute die beiden siege

932649 before i started that race the worlds i laughed and said to myself this is mine and became like a robot i hate losing and am addicted to winning i cant just see myself being second i have got to win
932650 if youre going to include a female cyclist i would give reade the edge over pendleton i have seen videos of her at the bmx world championships where she puts in some dominant victories
932651 my coach rang to say bmx had been introduced to the olympics that was it id wanted to be an english teacher but you can go back to college you cant go back to being an olympic gold medallist
932652 inspired me to make the crossover between the two sports
932653 bmx sucks at times as its not the most feminine of sports is it thats why i love to be queen of the after party
932654 you only get one shot at being the olympic champion and i am just grabbing it with both hands i dont ever want to look back and wonder why didnt i do that i dont ever want to be a failure i never want to think i lost the olympics because i didnt work hard enough or did something stupid
932655 she is a winner and will go all the way and likes to be around winners

932674 there is no means of avoiding the final collapse of a boom brought about by credit debt expansion the alternative is only whether the crisis should come sooner as the result of a voluntary abandonment of further credit debt expansion or later as a final and total catastrophe of the currency system involved
932675 the four major australian new zealand banks have already received undisclosed billions in loans and quasi capital injections from the australian futures fund
932676 there is an element of public good in investing bank bills because as the abn amro paper pointed out interest rates on home loans would probably be higher if australias major banks had been forced to obtain more expensive funding offshore the future fund took higher risks shifting its deposits from the risk free rba sic reserve bank of australia into bank bills but in doing so it acted within the parameters of its directions from the parliament to take an acceptable but not excessive level of risk
932677 i do not believe that our future fund or reserve bank are involved in underhand dealings
932678 my understanding is that all australian banks have done transactions with the future fund if you want debt in your portfolio having some bank term debt is not a bad option particularly given that you are getting more attractive spreads
932679 is there some federal protection beyond the au 20 000 per account holder which was recently announced

932682 there are common issues facing all indigenous peoples and hip hop music is a connection that we can use to spread the word
932683 when the military come armed into our communities in places like the northern territory or like they did in ruatoki last year it is important that indigenous peoples support each other

932687 playing is an essential part of growing up adventurous play both challenges and excites children and helps instil critical life skills
932688 constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life
932689 children both need and want to push their boundaries in order to explore their limits and develop their abilities
932690 since i was a young girl it has been my dream to become number one in the world when you get older at least one day you can say you were number one and no one can take that away from you you are in the sony ericsson wta tour history books and its a great achievement
932691 right now i know im going to be number one and im very very happy to be number one its a present for a lot of work in the past
932692 i secured the world number one ranking spot ive never been number one in the world before so finally i made that
932693 its huge to win your first sort of major tournament and to do it in a match like today makes it more special i put in a lot of work off the court to be able to win these sort of tournaments and it makes it all worthwhile
932694 he was playing a lot of slice and changing pace to my forehand i just lost the rhythm overall i wasnt really happy with the way i played today i could have played better
932695 its the first time in my life ive won back to back tournaments i used to win a tournament then lose first round the next week but now im always just taking it one match at a time its a new experience for me and really just amazing
932696 this was a great experience every round i beat a better player than me i played really well in this tournament hopefully in my next final i will be more relaxed and not be scared about it
932697 its been a fantastic week but it wasnt as easy as it looked i was a little bit nervous in the second set when she came back
932698 were going into the olympics playing i think the best we have all year to beat a great team like andy ram and jonathan erlich who have had a tremendous year it bodes well
932699 it hurts me so much to miss the olympics and the u s open you have no idea
932700 rainer schuettler claims that he should be allowed to compete in the games considering that he has been entered by the german noc national olympic committee and that he is eligible as a result of his position in the itf computer ranking due to the withdrawal of some players who were qualified for the olympic tournament

932722 we just feel we can do a little better because of our product knowledge and our ability to provide incentives to the retailers its a reaction to the business climate its not done with malice and its not a knee jerk thing
932723 one of the core strengths of pure play is our variety of product lines
932724 weve been very selective with the studios weve signed up and weve tried to structure our catalog so that the different lines are non competing the idea is to offer more to the retailer it shouldnt be all about price
932725 a fair amount but not so many that we dont know what were selling
932726 weve invested a fair amount of money to make this happen
932727 weve upgraded our server to handle more accounts and were trying to use a lot of technology to do things better for retail customers the old method was flawed because a wholesaler that carries 1 000 titles a month cant stock our entire product line it was a cumbersome system for stores to re order our titles now were carrying the inventory which speeds up the process

932738 otherwise it just becomes something that can be manipulated by politicians and political groups for their own advantage
932739 we can confirm we have received an allegation from another force in relation to an alleged incident in central london
932740 he did an incredible job with the joker i enjoyed watching him perform
932741 compared to the early 2000s when there was a lack of standards to govern rfid the industry has since then seen tremendous progress in the ratification of standards to aid in making this technology more effective
932742 significant milestones have been achieved in the past few years to ensure the various segments of the rfid industry including the passive tags segment are more standards centric directly benefiting the inlays market as well
932743 however end users will also need to look at rfid deployment from a more strategic and holistic perspective and not solely from the cost angle
932744 rfid offers enterprises the opportunity to save millions of dollars in operational cost apart from optimizing the safety and security of tagged resources
932745 this government is demanding pay cuts for police firefighters ambulance officers and child protection workers
932746 these people are putting their own safety on the line to protect their communities
932747 at best the wages policy is naive and stupid at worst it is insulting
932748 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
932749 currently no distinction is made between someone who has been arrested for breach of the peace and someone who has murdered somebody
932750 who had access to samples and profiles and for what purpose
932751 the national dna database is a key information tool which has revolutionised the way the police can protect the public through identifying offenders and securing more convictions it provides the police on average with almost 3 500 matches each month
932752 there must be better ways of catching criminals than spending millions of pounds of taxpayers money adding innocent people to the dna database public confidence has been shattered by the governments orwellian attempts to create a national dna database by stealth
932753 the government should take heed of these findings currently the dna database targets the innocent but not all the guilty
932754 we will severely punish airlines which experience aircraft occupations and other incidents as a result of service reasons which originate with the airline
932755 if there is bad weather for example we will tell the media to publicise it so that passengers can be informed ahead of time and avoid long waits at airports due to the weather

932758 my mother in law is 86 shes most of the time wheelchair bound
932759 shes frail bent over and anyone with half a brain could look at her close up and see that shes old frail and needs nurture a lot of tlc
932760 to subject an 86 year old to something like that is a bit over the top
932761 im taking a lot of confidence from this win you expect to get that after winning your first big tournament
932762 its different when you play against an opponent who plays a similar game with you
932763 he was playing a lot of slice and changing pace to my forehand i just lost the rhythm today
932764 i had a great match last night i played rocket tennis but that was not possible against andy today weve known each other since we were 13 or 14
932765 we used to watch these kind of matches on television and now we are playing them
932766 it was really hot but ive played all of my matches in these conditions
932767 but by the end we were both tired it was really getting to us
932768 i played a bit more aggressive and served a little bit smarter than i had in the past and obviously it worked
932769 its huge to win your first sort of major tournament and to do it in a match like today makes it more special
932770 we ask cambodia to move their soldiers who are near the ta muen thom temple
932771 i dont want to answer other questions otherwise it will escalate
932772 the situation along the border has not yet reached emergency state
932773 theyve been two of our best players all year and both are probably in the best form of their career
932774 theyre playing a lot of consistent footy and along with ben creagh theyre probably our three big guys
932775 it just means blokes like matty prior who was outstanding the other night and ricky thorby are going to get a little bit more time which theyre crying out for anyway and dan hunt now becomes our no 1 front rower so it puts a little bit more pressure on dan as well
932776 theres some good challenges there for different guys these things happen youve just got to be good enough to get yourself over them
932777 with the short turnaround its not the best scenario for myself the five day turnaround but ill do everything i cane to get on the field
932778 given there was one action in the tackle and that harvey had possession of the ball for most of the tackle it was deemed a legal tackle and not a reportable offence
932779 the court issued a tro temporary restraining order restraining the respondents from signing the moa memorandum of agreement
932780 is a very emotional issue this might revive old wounds
932781 we will not allow our soldiers to just be sitting ducks
932782 if there is really threat from certain groups then we will conduct actions against them
932783 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
932784 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
932785 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties
932786 the uk and other economies in europe which had enjoyed housing market booms have also weakened the decline in credit availability is accelerating this process
932787 in the prevailing market conditions this is a resilient performance which enables us to maintain our capital strength continue with our dividend policy and balance the need to conserve capital with our commitment to make it available for investment in our fast growing businesses
932788 i rang him and then i saw him walking down and then because there was a bit of a crowd around me i just told him to go because i didnt really need him there at that point
932789 heath has said that alan was not in the car with him
932790 alan was not in the car with him he had a mate in there with him who he doesnt wish to name because he doesnt want to bring his mate into it
932791 youd think they would understand their roles and responsibilities but obviously they dont at times
932792 when youve got a six day turnaround between matches and youve written yourself off
932793 there was a deep roaring sound like a bomb raid
932794 my wife was watching television then suddenly my daughter cried out my shutters exploded and part of our roof flew off
932795 the windows of my apartment suddenly blew up i lay down on the ground i just thought i was going to die
932796 you work your whole life and everything is gone in a few seconds

932807 if the conservatives are going to be coming into power next time around then lets share ideas and lets work something up together
932808 the regional channels are gaining a lot of viewership and critical mass it has become critical to be in the regional space
932809 undervalues the business and have decided not to agree to due diligence
932810 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value
932811 incidents that happened with hally probably happen ten times in a game so its all getting a little tedious and boring
932812 no one at the footy club even knew about it
932813 he pulled his arm away it was an innocuous thing
932814 as a footy club we probably cop it sweet if weve done the wrong thing but this is really just a barry hall fixation
932815 six scoring shots and in the second quarter we only went inside 50 metres seven times so it was hard for him to get hold of the ball
932816 he ended up kicking three and he couldve had six
932817 we are hoping this matter will be thrown out of court
932818 this is the man who is going to push south africa to a prosperous south africa and the people will have the privilege of getting work the poor ones will be supported
932819 one couldnt be in a better position as a book publisher than we are currently
932820 we like to keep all of our authors under wraps until the books publication we want to maximise media interest in all of our books thats the conventional strategy a publisher adopts
932821 through the dollar sweets campaign all the way through to the election last year
932822 for 20 years people have said to me all sorts of things you know you wont do this you wont do that
932823 all i can say to you is people who say that dont know me i am very very determined and i am very tough and i will lead us to the next election
932824 peter costello made clear that hes not available for the leadership and that remains the case he did that the day after the election
932825 he flagged he was thinking about the next phase of his professional life that he would do that with his family and im sure thats what hes doing
932826 new york courts have a proud history of interpreting the new york constitution as providing greater protections for individual rights than the federal constitution this case presents an opportunity to continue that tradition by declaring that the new york constitution prohibits the government from seizing private homes simply to turn them over to a developer who covets them for a massive luxury condominium project
932827 we are confident that the court will see this for what it is government officials bending to the will of bruce ratner allowing him to wield the power of eminent domain for his personal financial benefit
932828 occupancy of any such project shall be restricted to persons of low income as defined by law and preference shall be given to persons who live or shall have lived in such area or areas

932934 invasione della cecoslovacchia del 68 e delliraq del 2003 larma iniziale sono sempre le bugie amici di israele quelli facinorosi meglio perderli
932935 se non fosse per il forte sostegno della comunit ebraica a questa guerra contro liraq noi gli stati uniti non la staremmo facendo
932936 in questa visione cospiratoria questi uomini gli architetti ebrei e neoconservatori della guerra hanno un piano generale concepito anni orsono per eseguire gli ordini disraele di sbarazzarsi di saddam hussein
932937 ma che dire di quei falchi neoconservatori nascosti dentro lamministrazione di bush non scrivevano memoranda alla fine degli anni 90 chiedendo tra le altre cose labbattimento di saddam s
932938 si tratt di una polemica sulla sua rivista in cui dichiar che una piccola cricca di neoconservatori con legami nellamministrazione erano desiderosi di arruolare il sangue americano per rendere il mondo pi sicuro per israele
932939 quelli che sono a favore di questattacco ora ti dicono candidamente e privatamente che probabilmente vero che saddam hussein non una minaccia per gli stati uniti
932940 la minaccia di un attacco missilistico contro israele stata una delle ragioni dellattacco preventivo contro liraq ha detto il generale tommy franks
932941 non fa niente che se dipendesse dagli israeliani gli stati uniti dovrebbero puntare ad un cambio di regime in iran o in siria
932942 e non fa niente che questa cricca sia attualmente un gruppetto di falchi prevedibili che hanno anche esortato allazione in kosovo e bosnia a beneficio dei musulmani dimenticatevi di tutto ci
932943 questi neoconservatori in gran parte ebrei hanno spinto per azioni militari in kosovo e in bosnia che non fanno in alcun modo gli interessi disraele perci non leale dire che hanno spinto per unazione militare contro liraq per gli interessi disraele
932944 un certo numero di ebrei ha constatato che la sicurezza disraele richiedeva una forte dedizione americana in favore dellinternazionalismo e della difesa militare
932945 ancora la preferenza di vecchia data di bush per sharon non ha pi a che fare con il suo disgusto per yasser arafat del suo profondo affetto per richard perle
932946 solo the nation tra tutti i giornali americani ha osato indicare che un gran numero di ex lobbisti israeliani stanno lavorando adesso dentro lamministrazione americana e che i piani di bush per il medio oriente che potrebbero causare un enorme sconvolgimento politico nel mondo arabo collimano perfettamente con i sogni disraele sulla regione la rivista elencava il vice presidente dick cheney il super falco dellamministrazione americana e john bolton ora sottosegretario di stato per il controllo degli armamenti con douglas feith il terzo dirigente in ordine dimportanza del pentagono come membri del gruppo di consiglieri del jinsa prima del loro ingresso nel governo di bush richard perle presidente del defense policy board del pentagono tuttora consigliere dellistituto come lex direttore della cia james wolsey
932947 michael ledeen descritto da the nation come uno dei lobbisti pi influenti del jinsa a washington sta lanciando appelli per una
932948 il sito web del jinsa dice che esso esiste per
932949 secondo the nation irving moskovitz il magnate californiano che ha fondato insediamenti nei territori occupati da israele sia un finanziatore che il direttore del jinsa
932950 il presidente bush naturalmente non parler dellinfluenza di questi lobbisti pro israele quando presenter il suo progetto per il medio oriente alle nazioni unite
932951 ammettiamolo bush non un cospiratore connivente se non altro egli un uomo profondamente rozzo che si crea le opinioni viscerali e caparbie dei leader
932952 lintelligence militare americana aveva avvertito lamministrazione di bush nel febbraio del 2002 che la sua fonte chiave sulle relazioni di al qaeda con liraq aveva fornito
932953 nondimeno otto mesi pi tardi il presidente bush se ne usc con accuse che il governo iracheno di saddam hussein aveva addestrato membri della rete terrorista di osama bin laden a fabbricare veleni e gas mortali
932954 questinformazione de secretata fornisce prove drammatiche supplementari che le dichiarazioni pre belliche dellamministrazione erano ingannevoli
932955 una nazione che non aveva armi nucleari che potevano minacciare gli stati uniti il solo paese per il quale liraq di saddam rappresentava una minaccia era israele
932956 le ragioni di questa politica guerrafondaia nei confronti delliraq sono il petrolio e israele
932957 il ministro delle infrastrutture disraele joseph paritzky stava considerando la possibilit di riaprire il vecchio oleodotto che collegava mosul al porto di haifa mancando israele di fonti energetiche proprie e dipendendo dal petrolio assai costoso della russia la riapertura delloleodotto avrebbe trasformato la sua economia
932958 si appreso da fonti diplomatiche che lamministrazione di bush ha detto che non sosterr labolizione delle sanzioni contro liraq se i successori di saddam non riforniranno israele di petrolio
932959 tutto questo d peso alla teoria che la guerra di bush parte di un piano per rimodellare il medio oriente per fare gli interessi disraele
932960 cos quando un consigliere della casa bianca suggerisce che questo presidente crede che affrontare le tirannie nel nostro interesse e coincide con i nostri valori diciamo che la cosa pi complessa
932961 ecco la verit gli ebrei americani non hanno una visione monolitica su una eventuale guerra contro liraq un sondaggio effettuato dallamerican jewish committee mostra che il 59 degli ebrei approva la guerra mentre il 36 la disapprova numeri che rispecchiano nellinsieme lopinione pubblica
932962 se i poteri forti europei fossero intervenuti contro le ambizioni aggressive di hitler nel 1938 invece di trattare con lui a monaco lumanit avrebbe potuto risparmiarsi gli orrori senza precedenti della seconda guerra mondiale

932975 el presidente espa ol jos luis rodr guez zapatero ha afirmado que el separatista vasco genera un sentimiento de desprecio comprensible en todos los ciudadanos y por supuesto en el jefe del gobierno pero debemos respetar la ley la rabia se vio incrementada por el hecho de que de juana vaya a vivir en la misma calle de san sebasti n que las viudas de tres v ctimas de atentados de eta de juana se ha beneficiado de un c digo penal introducido en 1973 que permite reducciones de sentencias de hasta 12 a os por buena conducta la ley fue modificada en 1995 eliminando las generosas liberaciones anticipadas

932983 la organizaci n terrorista vasca eta ha perdido su contundencia y la oportunidad para negociar
932984 el estado de derecho que no prev condenas de cadena perpetua ni mucho menos penas de muerte es en ocasiones dif cil de entender la vicepresidenta del gobierno fern ndez de la vega ha declarado que al gobierno igual que a la mayor a de los espa oles le repugna que de juana chaos se encuentre en libertad de juana chaos ya le ha provocado varios quebraderos de cabeza a este gobierno en noviembre de 2006 este terrorista de eta que nunca se ha arrepentido comenz una huelga de hambre que casi le cuesta la vida su huelga de hambre fue muy inoportuna para el jefe del gobierno rodr guez zapatero coincidi con el momento en el que sus enviados especiales intentaban negociar un fin del terror con la c pula de eta esto fue muy controvertido en espa a la oposici n de derechas acus al gobierno de arrodillarse ante eta
932985 desde que concluy la ltima tregua en junio del pasado a o han muerto cuatro personas en atentados de eta eta ha perdido la contundencia de tiempos pasados y la oportunidad desaprovechada de la oferta de negociaci n del gobierno zapatero le ha costado algunas de las pocas simpat as restantes tanto en el extranjero como dentro del pa s incluso arnaldo otegi portavoz del brazo pol tico ilegalizado de eta batasuna quiere abandonar la pol tica activa seg n informa el diario el pa s actualmente la oposici n espa ola de derechas ya no tiene nada que objetar de la pol tica antiterrorista de zapatero la salida de prisi n de i aki de juana chaos recuerda a malos tiempos que afortunadamente ya han pasado

933104 many of these older fuel oil tanks are partially or fully buried or sealed and releases of oil cant be detected by odor many times its not until ground contamination is discovered or a minor permeation grows into a major leak that the problem is detected
933105 most of these oil tanks were installed at the time the buildings were built in the 1940s 1950s 1960s and 1970s and they are much larger than doors stairs and hallways connecting their location to the outside making it almost impossible to remove and replace them intact with age these tanks can present serious problems new technologies now make it easy and cost efficient to refurbish these tanks in place saving thousands of dollars in replacement costs and virtually eliminating potential pollution problems
933106 corrosion is a funny animal and the overall structural integrity of most of the steel tanks we examine is almost as good as the day it was installed the problems come from isolated corrosion cells making minute permeations through the steel shell of the tank allowed to grow these corrosion permeations can go from a minor weeping to a quarter inch hole if not addressed a lot of oil can escape from a small hole and it doesnt take a tanker load to cause a pollution problem
933107 the refurbishing is sort of like a tank in a tank approach the fiberglass plastic or elastomeric lining system we fabricate inside the steel tank adds an additional structural wall and is not subject to corrosion the abrasive blasting process conditions the interior steel tank wall before we add the fiberglass or plastic this helps guard against future internal corrosion problems
933108 we dont do environmental studies or cleanups so i wouldnt comment about that its our job to find minor problems or situations before they become problems and remedy them before you get to the point of needing environmental services
933109 what we do isnt rocket science its just good sound engineering process
933110 despite such a clear demonstration of the power of integrating search and offline channels
933111 surprisingly the strategy has yet to gain widespread adoption unfortunately by failing to integrate their efforts with offline search marketers are essentially ignoring the very channels that drive users to search obviously there is a big disconnect between search marketing strategy and search engine user behavior
933112 theres no question about the combined power of search and offline channels that is well established
933113 whats missing from this equation is the right environment to truly push integration forward and fully reap its benefits it is incumbent upon the cmo to break down the silos eliminate the obstacles that plague its progress and create a culture that rewards integrated efforts
933114 while search marketers are diversifying their digital content portfolios with videos press releases and images to remain competitive in the blended search landscape
933115 their lack of alignment with user behavior suggests that they are missing the mark again this speaks to the big disconnect between search marketer strategy and search engine user behavior to fully capitalize on their efforts search marketers need to take user behavior into consideration at all times
933116 hard to achieve very hard probably even impossible to fake this kind of shot

933188 add these firms to ubs and wachovia and we call it progress for the 150 000 auction rate securities victims in fact we expect two more big us banks to be added to the list within the next two weeks
933189 but now is not the time to fall asleep at the switch
933190 actually this is more than just a scandal it is the worst case of fraud in us history and we are doing everything we can think of to help the 150 000 auction rate securities victims we were happy to see citi group and merrill lynch get added to what will soon be growing list of big us or european banks or stock brokerage firms under investigation expect two more big us banks in the next two weeks
933191 we have been involved in helping in federal amp state investigations before and dont get your hopes up the best you can expect is about the same as a auction rate securities class action ten cents on the dollar we are advising against class actions we are strongly encouraging auction rate securities victims to call us so we can explain the restricted trading network and give them the names of the best securities arbitration attorneys in the country
933192 we want every victim of the auction rate securities fraud to get as much of their money back as possible and arbitration is the only way it will happen
933193 as long as we are talking reality we are also advising all auction rate securities victims to have their stock broker or bank manager investment officer to put in writing that everything will be ok or dont worry we are working very hard at fixing this
933194 if you have student loan auction rate securities if your auction rate securities statement shows a mark down if your stock broker or banker is not returning your calls we will help you fight to get your money back after talking to over 2000 victims many of whom are senior citizens working class people or disabled people who were all cheated by their bank or stock broker with arps ars or slars americas watchdog will not back down for one simple reason its now personal
933195 americas watchdog is devoted to the idea of getting every auction rate security victim as much of their money back as possible from stock brokers and banks that lied about a safe just like cash liquid investment
933196 it has no context and no structure and offers no pathway between education and the world of work it has no relevance to young people
933197 they develop an attitude that they just dont care about what happens to them or to other people
933198 it was one of those moments when i realised that i could keep talking about what needed to be done by the government or society or i could actually go out there and try to do something about it myself
933199 the reason they are stabbing each other is that they are bored their behaviour is a perfect reflection of what they see their future will look like
933200 often placements give young people a confused notion of what business is like they get out of their depth and are overwhelmed they fall asleep at a desk and dont turn up
933201 we build the programme around what they want to do and what they want out of life
933202 we give them a placement with a company that reflects their interest the programme is designed around the skills sets that businesses say they are missing
933203 it involves filing and odd bits of labour that nobody wants to do being dumped on a work experience person later in life they might resent that
933204 he had applied to be on our programme and there was a chance he may have been accepted next year
933205 the single parent on a limited budget bringing up children in a deprived and sometimes threatening area has developed an amazing range of skills that can be honed for the workplace
933206 it is a different style of learning more rooted in real life experiences
933207 extremely doubtful that the same qualification can be fit for a wide range of purposes such as university entrance and recruitment to craft and technician levels in employment
933208 the it diploma is preparation for the world of work not specifically for a degree in it
933209 we entered students with a maths gcse in the functional skills exam it is supposedly the same level but they all failed they can do the maths but explaining how that is used in a business environment is what threw them it is challenging especially when young people do not have these life experiences
933210 most schools have neither the range of equipment nor expertise to teach practical skills to industrial standards so the danger is that the diploma will become less about honing up practical skills than writing or talking about them
933211 the diploma should not be looked at as something for disaffected youngsters they may not stand a chance to complete the whole thing
933212 many top scientists have come up through doing a levels but the diploma will add other skills with a focus on applied learning
933213 we need to be clear what we are selling to employers
933214 straight away we had dozens of offers from schools wanting to pilot this new way of teaching even though we hadnt yet prepared anything
933215 they might seem straightforward but teachers found it quite difficult to devise ways of teaching them
933216 the only way to develop this style of learning was to practise it in the classroom it was no longer a case of standing in front of the class and talking at pupils
933217 over the year we found far fewer referrals for bad behaviour among the group doing om and there was better engagement and attitudes to learning
933218 we believe this is because we have given them the skills and tools to help them to learn and engage better even when they reverted to a traditional timetable
933219 there is an erroneous baseline assumption by teachers that young people know how to learn when in reality they dont
933220 unless young people feel confident capable and engaged in their learning they are not going to succeed
933221 om has been a very successful journey for us we have a school of happy motivated pupils who are engaged and willing to learn
933222 group activities in the classroom have helped social cohesion as pupils learn outside their friendship groups and those students who start off as less gregarious develop a confidence of their own pupils appreciate the value of their classmates contributions
933223 pupils dont need to be taught how to draw a graph in maths science and geography separately they need to learn this once but how to adapt it to different situations and see its generic value this is how opening minds works
933224 good schools are those where children learn how to get on with others to manage their lives and to become active citizens creativity imagination and communication skills should be valued as highly as being able to write an essay
933225 we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices
933226 we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays
933227 i dont see a lot of cash on the table over a quarter of young people live below the poverty line it is vital that financial support is available if those young people are to benefit

933243 while we must reflect the global stock market as it is we must also recognize the rapid rise of companies in countries such as india
933244 we have already seen great indian companies acquiring famous brands such as jaguar and land rover but these developments are just the beginning of a long term trend that will fundamentally change the international corporate landscape

933347 every year in this country approximately 6 500 children are treated in emergency departments for diving related injury
933348 more than 80 of the dive injuries were from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive thats not a platform dive this is the lowest dive height available at the pool
933349 there is a need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risks of diving related injuries among children and adolescents
933350 the recent growth of the sport of diving coupled with the increasing complexity and difficulty of dives has resulted in a greater potential for both competitive and recreational diving related injuries
933351 based on our findings the largest age group of injured divers was 10 to 14 year olds
933352 although this group made up the largest number of injured divers 10 to 19 years olds were more at risk for an injury to the extremities boys were two times more likely to experience a head or neck injury or a fracture
933353 parents pediatricians coaches lifeguards and trainers need to be aware of the types of injuries seen during recreational and competitive diving as well as the risk factors
933354 doesnt look like the other presidents on our dollar bills

933356 the federal government has no constitutional authority to be involved in school curricula or to control jobs in the market place that is why we will abolish the department of education end federal meddling in our schools
933357 the key to the quality of american higher education is that it is not one system
933358 it is a marketplace of more than 6 000 autonomous institutions regulated primarily by competition for students faculty and research dollars and by consumer choice federal dollars following students to institutions of their choosing there is in addition an independent system of accreditation

933360 youve got three supply side worries pushing oil higher today iran the storm and nigeria

933362 for the past two months there have been radically different figures such as the rise in oil prices or interest rates that give us the idea that the economic situation is worse than any of us had thought
933363 wir schauen uns um in bereichen des online marketings die wir noch nicht abdecken

933368 over in 1 john we are reminded of the things which do not come from god but from the world
933369 here is the comparison good for food lust of the flesh delight to the eyes lust of the eyes desirable to make one wise the boastful pride of life i dont know about you but id never thought about this in this way it really opened my eyes and made me think about what it might be in my life that satan is holding out in temptation just as he tempted eve with the forbidden fruit for i am jealous for you with a godly jealousy for i betrothed you to one husband so that to christ i might present you as a pure virgin but i am afraid that as the serpent deceived eve with his craftiness your minds will be led astray from the purity of devotion to christ
933370 you are more worried about what others think than coveting wisdom as eve did

933372 nature has endowed this carnivore with more than enough bite force to kill and eat large and potentially dangerous prey
933373 pound for pound the great whites bite is not particularly impressive but the sheer size of the animal means that in absolute terms it tops the scales it must also be remembered that its extremely sharp serrated teeth require relatively little force to drive them through thick skin fat and muscle
933374 this is a very subtle difference but it is significant
933375 persons with emerging als may also have similarly subtle symptoms
933376 we can only guess why this pattern is less common in the mutants
933377 such therapies could very well be effective against the non genetic version of the disease as well
933378 the discovery of reliable behavioral endpoints with predictive validity even before a good understanding of their etiology is achieved can significantly improve intervention research
933379 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
933380 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
933381 we know so much about the harmful effects of exposure to violent media content but how much exposure children actually get has been largely ignored now were learning more about the large numbers of kids seeing this material and who they are
933382 no expert in child development would advocate for subjecting children as young as 10 to this level of violence yet the study shows that such exposure is commonplace in this country
933383 we should re think the current movie rating system which has been in place for 40 years and was designed when kids could only see movies in theaters ratings need to be more prominent on all movies whether they are seen in theaters or purchased in the store and we need clearer messages to parents pediatricians and child advocates should instruct parents to strictly abide by the movie age guidelines and to closely monitor movie viewing
933384 our study found that several cm types are used by nearly half of cancer survivors
933385 surprisingly other methods such as acupuncture and hypnosis were used by fewer than 2 of cancer survivors even though recent studies found them to be useful in relieving some cancer related symptoms such as pain we also found that the use of various cm types is significantly influenced by gender race age education cancer type and how far the cancer had spread

933402 moms in every stage of life blogging about motherhood marriage and family life
933403 so that the criminalization of homophobia and the civil union may be approved
933404 pop culture proves that teens are more ready than ever to discuss the subject of sex
933405 we believe that miley is both influential and relatable to this afflicted set and is the obvious choice to get the message of safe sex out to teens across america
933406 i suspect this is the beginning of a new kind of baby boom although its going to be nowhere near the baby boom of the 1950s or 60s
933407 one interpretation of these studies is that men are unable to ward off temptation we do not subscribe to this instead we believe men simply interpret these interactions differently than women do
933408 we think that if men believed an attractive available woman was a threat to their relationship they might try to protect that relationship
933409 women have been socialized to be wary of the advances of attractive men
933410 these findings show that even if a man is committed to his relationship he may still need to formulate strategies to protect his relationship by avoiding that available attractive woman the success rate of such strategies may not be 100 percent but it is likely to be significantly higher than if the man was not made aware of the specific consequences of his actions
933411 we were surprised at how many tweens or kids ages 11 and 12 are dealing with these issues
933412 parents while they think they know what their teens or more importantly tweens relationships are theyre really not fully aware of whats going on and thats scary
933413 raising children is hard youve got to connect with love at all times if love dies nothing else is important but if love is there youve got something
933414 were supposed to be able to learn from this and not criticized for no reason
933415 i knew that i wasnt ready to be a parent but i never expected it to be this hard
933416 i cant do this i didnt need three weeks to do this whole experiment i just needed 24 hours with her
933417 just take the baby and go i dont care anymore this is bull
933418 id rather be single for the rest of my life
933419 see how hard it is to give you what you need
933420 financially he destroyed me just a lot of ways people shouldnt be allowed to do that and hopefully hell think twice before he does it to someone else
933421 i felt degraded made myself look cheap and easy total regret
933422 often women said things like i felt so flattered so happy that he found me attractive
933423 what women dont seem to see is that men drop their standards massively for a one night stand
933424 no woman should be flattered because a man wants to have sex with her once
933425 has spent his celibate life including nine years as a missionary in india mulling connubial bliss his decades of marriage counseling led him to distill some mostly common sense advice about how to dodge mates who would maul your happiness
933426 never marry a man who has no friends this usually means that he will be incapable of the intimacy that marriage demands
933427 steer clear of someone whose life you can run who never makes demands counter to yours its good to have a doormat in the home but not if its your husband
933428 does he have a sense of humor that covers a multitude of sins
933429 dont marry a problem character thinking you will change him hes a heavy drinker or some other kind of addict but if he marries a good woman hell settle down people are the same after marriage as before only more so
933430 take a good unsentimental look at his family youll learn a lot about him and his attitude towards women
933431 does he possess those character traits that add up to a good human being the willingness to forgive praise be courteous or is he inclined to be a fibber to fits of rage to be a control freak to be envious of you to be secretive
933432 do not be bound together with unbelievers for what partnership has righteousness and lawlessness or what fellowship has light with darkness or what harmony has christ with belial or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever
933433 do you both share the same commitment to spiritual growth and to serving god
933434 do not love the world nor the things in the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him
933435 i love that people remember me for that i took a stand and i was a voice for a generation im proud of that
933436 you could have anything you wanted whenever you wanted it
933437 does considerable harm and it compounds their confusion trying to delay puberty or change someones gender
933438 i think the important point now is that the industry has reached yet another new low level in terms of sales in 2008
933439 the industry seemed to be travelling at an annual sales rate of about 15m in the first quarter recall that for a period of about eight years we were around 17m about 14m sales rate in the second quarter and now it looks like the sales rate in july is in the 12 13m range
933440 we expect the second half of the year the sales rate will be about 13 and that the full year including the 15 in the first quarter and the 14 in the second will be in the 14 to 14 and a half million range
933441 right now today about 17 of the industry is involved in leasing it has been trending down as manufacturers begin to understand what was going on in the truck and suv market its still going to be a part of our business we want to offer leasing to customers and in certain regions of the country and for certain vehicles its a more important part of the proposition
933442 having the industrys most fuel efficient lineup is of value to us so long as we have the right product mix in our showrooms
933443 thats why were accelerating production of four cylinder models and quickly responding to market conditions with repurposed us plants and plans for a us built prius

933449 ive got six kids i certainly wouldnt want a judge watching over everything that i do and i wouldnt want my kids being able to run to the judge
933450 this judge needs to be grounded and sent to her room a 12 year old girl violated rules and disobeyed her father the rules by the way were intended to protect the girl from endangering herself on the internet in posting pictures of herself on the internet on a dating site for crying out loud she defied her father and his authority after going to the court she got away with it
933451 weve heard rumors of this stuff before ive just noticed from my time coaching that girls are not as modest now as they were 10 years ago
933452 seemed more upset when they werent pregnant than when they were
933453 they are really looking for love in all the wrong places theyre just trying to get the guys attention by acting provocative and now theyre getting pregnant looking for unconditional love from their babies
933454 theyre so excited to finally have someone to love them unconditionally
933455 i try to explain its hard to feel loved when an infant is screaming to be fed at 3 a m

933457 i urge you to encourage all couples regardless of orientation to follow the pattern of first being married in a secular service and then being blessed in the episcopal church
933458 there are a lot of benefits in getting out of the legal marriage business
933459 this way the clergy and the couple can focus on the spiritual blessings the church has to offer and not the political stuff
933460 parents are in the dark when it comes to knowing what their kids are doing online this report clearly demonstrates a global digital divide between parents and their cyber savvy children

933463 the future is the future i want to be back in washington but weird things happen in free agency if antawn is not back then theres no point in me coming back because hes part of my success too when youre doing pick and roll with a player like him they cant double you they cant trap you because you have a pick and pop guy who can shoot the three at your four position my success is because of him too if he doesnt come back im not coming back
933464 the coaches did a very good job for us under tough situations and kept us afloat if you said our leading scorer was going to be out for 69 games i dont think most people wouldve thought that our record would be what it was and that wed have the fifth seed so i think our coaches did a very nice job for us
933465 its good because were on the same page we want to sign antawn we want to sign gilbert so i kind of like that he supported his teammate and he likes playing with antawn and thats been our plan all along so its good to see were on the same page
933466 were going to add two players to this roster just by being healthy one is center etan thomas because at times we couldve used a bigger body and someone with some experience and then putting gilbert back out there is like adding another player we feel confident that with this group we can compete with anybody i believe in continuity and keeping our core group together
933467 he watches to see which way youre going to make him go and then
933468 wow that dunk ooooooh did you see that take daaaang what a dagger what a pass
933469 i was built for this im not 6 9 260 pounds to shoot jumpers all night i go to the hole and i create contact dont ever think im the only person feeling that
933470 the government is preparing to give millions of law abiding citizens risk assessment scores that will follow them throughout their lives
933471 if that wasnt frightening enough none of us will have the ability to know our own score or to challenge it homeland security needs to delay the deployment of this system and allow for an informed public debate on this dangerous proposal

933476 more than his throws what i was pleased with is how he was looking to the right guy when he was backpedaling
933477 he knew the plays knew the routes he should feel very good about his performance
933478 i like the way he plays were standing up here away from him but you can feel his energy he brings a certain energy to the game a certain energy to this team
933479 with regard to child pornography the government knows full well that their allegations are false yet they highlight these irresponsible and purposely damaging statements in order to demonize e gold in the eyes of the public
933480 as ive talked to different people it turns out that kind of the demographic that this covers is people with a lot of money that are empty nesters that have already married off their own kids so they cant plan any more parties or weddings or they dont have any kids and this is their surrogate children
933481 it seems like there are a whole lot of people out there with money to spend who love to plan parties and have things for their pets
933482 fundamentally ive got a problem with the whole marriage thing from a monogamy standpoint i mean the first time the bride comes into heat all the groomsmen are running up there and she turns into a total tramp
933483 i over the years have taken a very strong stand on drug issues but in light of the tremendous growth of government power since 9 11 it has forced me and other conservatives to go back and take a renewed look at how big and powerful we want the government to be in people s lives
933484 the irs must have the tools needed to address under reporting of this income
933485 i have no idea who it would be referring to
933486 every professional seller ive ever talked to pays their taxes and has no problem with anyone finding out about the level of business theyre doing
933487 we certainly take that as a starting point and we certainly look forward to addressing the tax gap
933488 quality software remains a key business differentiator businesses and the it organizations supporting them have no choice with regard to quality initiatives and the need to address the debilitating costs of software defects
933489 organizations should evaluate current process and organizational approaches to software quality in combination with automated approaches for code analysis and testing to help enable more secure successful better managed software implementations
933490 based on our collaboration with idc the industry now has hard data confirming what nearly every software development organization has suspected for years quality problems are consuming significant resources and still compromise the integrity of software in the field
933491 development organizations today need innovative tools that automate the tedious process of defect detection so their valued developers can stay focused on delivering new features and functionality instead of debugging problems left over from previous releases

933506 i see no point in giving somebody 4 percent of my money
933507 the sad truth is that the fcc is ill equipped to detect isps interfering with your internet connection its up to concerned internet users to investigate possible network neutrality violations and effs switzerland software is designed to help with that effort
933508 im a firm believer that the grass isnt always greener on the other side
933509 you look at the past four years and only us and detroit have made it to the playoffs in each of the last four years in the eastern conference thats pretty good company
933510 as a team and as individuals we wanted to get better defensively and our defense improved tremendously in the first year of our new system
933511 challenging every year its a challenge over an 82 game schedule you have tough times that you need to recover from and come back from and we did that
933512 after all of the experience that i have had as a player and coach you always prepare yourself for the worst and hope for the best
933513 a key for us will be staying healthy right now its about getting guys healthy giving them an off season conditioning program and getting ready for the summer league
933514 weve said it all along from mr pollin to ernie to myself its a priority to sign gilbert and antawn
933515 for our rookies this is the most crucial summer of their career they have a little change in their pocket now but three weeks of rest cant turn into three months rest for them ive experienced that with players earlier in my coaching career its important that they keep their conditioning right and that they stay professional we want them to be more consistent and more professional
933516 just stay healthy take care of our bodies make sure our minds are clear and be ready for next training camp
933517 it was a shock but it is what it is we overcame a lot of things this season i told everybody that we had a great year we rallied together and accomplished a lot this season
933518 im looking forward to everybody coming back i would love to have those guys back and i think that those guys will be back in a wizards uniform next season
933519 the knock on us has always been our defense in that area we made a great improvement we used to be ranked in the low 20s in the league and this season we were in the middle of the pack next season we want to be in the top ten and continue our push for a championship thats what its all about
933520 he should have been considered for coach of the year when we had our injuries everyone counted us out all of a sudden we were talked about as a playoff team somehow some way he made it happen
933521 this is a key summer for andray everyone has been patient with him and hes shown some flashes but this is a big summer for him
933522 the biggest thing we can do is find a way to stay healthy for a long period of time it would be interesting to see what we could do if we could stay away from the injury bug if we can do that i think well be fine
933523 our season was very interesting we had our ups and our downs but everybody on this team at some point helped us win games and we have to be proud of that
933524 i think it was a good season for us overall obviously we lost in the playoffs and that hurts but we did a lot of good things this year we got better defensively and a lot of people had breakout years
933525 we got close but gilbert came back too late we lost caron for too many games and we still finished fifth in the east and put ourselves in a position to take the series to game seven but we lost in the end still we did a lot of good things
933526 he should have been coach of the year he didnt have gilbert an all star player and caron got hurt but we still made the playoffs played above 500 and he really kept everyone together he did a great job
933527 there are a lot of different characters in here but hes a players coach he asks our opinion he doesnt put us down and he lets you go out there and play and make your own decisions to be your own man hes the best coach ive played for in that sense he makes it easier
933528 i think we have to be pleased with the way that the season went overall we had a number of injuries to the key guys and that made it kind of tough we were a very resilient group and we believed in each other and the coaching staff and we continued to push forward we earned the fifth seed which we were pleased with under the circumstances but we lost to cleveland and you can never be pleased with losing to the same team three years in a row
933529 it was a tough year for us because of the amount of obstacles and hurdles we had to go through that makes it a little bit more rewarding to make it to the playoffs and earn a fifth seed who knows what would have happened if the circumstances were different a healthy gilbert arenas makes us a much deeper team we cant do much more about it now we just have to pick our heads up and move forward i am very proud of my teammates and the coaching staff
933530 coach jordan was a rock throughout the whole season the different things that we have gone through this year including the losing streaks and the injuries he was still optimistic and i tip my hat off because he did a fantastic job
933531 crucial is an understatement my job is to play not to make those decisions but it is a must we want to make a run at something that we feel is so close
933532 it was a roller coaster just like every other season i know weve been repeating ourselves for the last two years but we just have to stay healthy thats the biggest problem weve had we just have to stay healthy
933533 it was a good year we had a better record than last year even with the injuries and i think that says a lot personally i had the best year of my career i would say it was a breakout year for me as far as minutes and production
933534 i am from dc i love it here and this is where i got my first real opportunity i told my agent that i would love to sign back here but it is free agency so who knows what could happen
933535 i felt i was consistent this year i worked hard last summer and i felt my approach to the game was much better i was always ready whenever my number was called on
933536 i was able to do some things that i thought i could not do out there this is going to be a big summer for me to work on my game and improve i want to improve on everything but my ball handling and my jump shot especially
933537 i tried my best to go out and play and be a part of it but my leg wasnt recovering fast enough after each game even with missed practices and just playing in games it still wasnt recovering this nerve pinch just came out of the blue the swelling and achiness i can take that but each step feels like youre hitting my funny bone eventually that is wearing and tearing so its back to phase 3 motion work light light motion work
933538 no no no no you never second guess your decision there are a lot of players that never even played in the postseason and the team did a great job of getting us here and giving me the opportunity to go out there and play so i went out there and did everything i could i came off the bench i did everything i could to keep this team intact and not interrupt but at the end of the day when youre playing five on 4 1 2 youre interrupting and you need to have five healthy people to win a series
933539 thats the way the cookies crumble the first time we lost to them i was like ok the basketball gods are with them the chosen one is the chosen one for a reason then last year two guys are out and they go to the eastern conference final this year with my knee and carons hip its like another year but as long as you go out and play hard you give your 100 percent thats all you can ask for
933540 no no no im not getting cut again nerves arent like that not this one
933541 weve prepared ourselves through the course of 69 games and i think weve performed very well without gilbert were a different team with gil were very explosive he adds another dimension to us but were ready to go without him if he cant if he has to shut it down
933542 i guess thats what they want to do this year hurt lebron james
933543 i dont remember anyone saying blatantly theyre trying to hurt me before but the game has changed a lot you definitely couldnt say that back in the day the nature of the game has changed from the bad boys with the pistons the knicks you said that and you wouldve been seen as plain out soft i never heard magic say it or mike or larry
933544 gt oh and deshawn stevenson diss has made it to youtube
933545 i was trying to slow him down so he could save his legs for tomorrow but he looked good and it looks like hes ready to go for tomorrow
933546 considering the fouls they gave on us you at least have to go for the ball
933547 you can throw your body at anyone you want it just seems like watching the fouls they gave on us pretend youre going to block the ball and throw your body at the layup guy thats a good technique
933548 i was going to foul him so he wouldnt get a monster dunk in the halfcourt and going to foul him on thursday to make sure he doesnt get a monster dunk in the foul court im not trying to push him out of bounds and foul him hard it was one of those things it was bang bang it happened at the last minute i didnt see him but i dont want anybody to think i was trying to hurt one of the games best players
933549 his name is lebron james not lebron brown hes not your son
933550 i bought an old computer keyboard from value village sprinkled it with alfalfa seeds and sprouted them that took a good week by april 1 there were nice thick green sprouts coming up between the keys i pushed my bosss regular keyboard to the back of the keyboard drawer and put this keyboard in its place he sort of laughed but started picking the spouts out and dumping them in the trash i couldnt believe hed think id do that to his actual keyboard though that made it funnier
933551 constant home do over fetish in real life and in the reality of reality tv
933552 you could and will say the harpers had it coming but really we all had this coming
933553 one thing well always remember about this decade was the constant home do over fetish in real life and in the reality of reality tv the constant warping of the consumers sense of entitlement the fairy dust economics the mastercard reminder that the experience is priceless
933554 its aggravating it just makes you mad you do that much work and they just squander it
933555 i am a 61 year old rn who was raised by my parents who had been young adults in the great depression
933556 they continued to save money relentlessly even with my fathers income as an anesthesiologist now when i discuss the economy with my like aged friends we are so grateful for all the frugal living experiences we have had
933557 while others may lament phil gramms comments i much like you believe we are reacting to the word and not the message clearly we are a blessed nation and people as i look at our own lifestyle i realize not only how much we have but how much beyond what we need we have
933558 i put myself through college mainly by working part time full time in summer a very small amount from my parents and some very small scholarships when i got out of school i loved to spend every last dime because i never had the ability to do so prior to that i built up a little debt not bad but enough that it was stressful to me then i finally realized that the thing to do is live beneath your means your version of the mental recession people criticize or tease me for driving my 1994 rusty eagle talon but hey its paid for
933559 to me owning a home is primarily something you do to house your family and secondarily to gain a sense of security from owning your own piece of real estate that you can modify as you wish i believe that owning a home has absolutely nothing to do with investing
933560 we have worked hard to find a place we could afford then slowly pay off the loans
933561 when we first looked the bank tried to get us to buy something they said we could afford but we wanted to feel comfortable with the payment so we continued to look for 2 years until we found something somewhat lower but still great
933562 using tax dollars to shore up failing businesses like fannie mae and freddie mac and to help big banks weather their self inflicted crises is just wrong its an unfair burden on those who played by the rules were about to own our home and were being asked to help out people who bought bigger and fancier houses beyond their means and got into financial trouble
933563 buying a home was the scariest thing i ever did on closing day i resisted a powerful impulse to forfeit my sizeable deposit and simply walk away i was 32 and single and i imagined disaster if i ever failed to make a mortgage payment id avoided debt until that time and it pained me to owe that kind of money for 30 years
933564 the value of my house means security to me its mine and is worth an amount i never thought id be able to call my own my home is my refuge and the context for my life its where i am grateful to live my days
933565 the next projects return profile is where we spend our time
933566 the optimism on gold may be in need of a little dampening
933567 gold may be ahead of the realities of the world
933568 on average the stocks have ceased to be a bargain
933569 the possibility of higher energy prices tighter credit conditions and a still deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth
933570 at our annual banquet a contractor service provider made reservations for his whole family but then did not show up to the event
933571 we cover the cost of the meals and missing the event is usually forgiven but as a joke we sent a bill to him he didnt know what to think

933689 and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb
933690 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world
933691 here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus
933692 and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of god
933693 and i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount sion and with him an hundred forty and four thousand having his fathers name written in their foreheads
933694 and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel
933695 and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea
933696 saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads
933697 now o king establish the decree and sign the writing that it be not changed according to the law of the medes and persians which altereth not

933699 thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain
933700 but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it
933701 moreover also i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify them
933702 here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus
933703 and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ
933704 and in their mouth was found no guile for they are without fault before the throne of god
933705 and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth
933706 and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of god and they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works lord god almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints

933711 and he said unto them the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath
933712 for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works
933713 there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god did from his
933714 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him
933715 honour thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
933716 he saith unto him which jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness
933717 for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself
933718 what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid nay i had not known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet
933719 sunday is a catholic institution and its claims to observance can be defended only on catholic principles from beginning to end of scripture there is not a single passage that warrants the transfer of weekly public worship from the last day of the week to the first
933720 protestantism in discarding the authority of the roman catholic church has no good reasons for its sunday theory and ought logically to keep saturday as the sabbath
933721 it is well to remind the presbyterians baptists methodists and all other christians that the bible does not support them anywhere in their observance of sunday sunday is an institution of the roman catholic church and those who observe the day observe a commandment of the catholic church
933722 reason and common sense demand the acceptance of one or the other of these alternatives either protestantism and the keeping holy of saturday or catholicity and the keeping holy of sunday compromise is impossible
933723 god simply gave his catholic church the power to set aside whatever day or days she would deem suitable as holy days the church chose sunday the first day of the week and in the course of time added other days as holy days
933724 protestants accept sunday rather than saturday as the day for public worship after the catholic church made the change but the protestant mind does not seem to realize that in accepting the bible in observing the sunday they are accepting the authority of the spokesman for the church the pope
933725 question have you any other way of proving that the catholic church has power to institute festivals of precept
933726 answer had she not such power she could not have substituted the observance of sunday the first day of the week for saturday the seventh day a change for which there is no scriptural authority
933727 there was and is a command to keep holy the sabbath day but that sabbath day was not sunday it will however be readily said and with some show of triumph that the sabbath was transferred from the seventh to the first day of the week with all its duties privileges and sanctions earnestly desiring information on this subject which i have studied for many years i ask where can the record of such a transaction be found not in the new testament absolutely not there is no scriptural evidence of the change of the sabbath institution from the seventh to the first day of the week
933728 it is quite clear that however rigidly or devotedly we may spend sunday we are not keeping the sabbath the sabbath was founded on a specific divine command we can plead no such command for the observance of sunday there is not a single line in the new testament to suggest that we incur any penalty by violating the supposed sanctity of sunday
933729 for when there could not be produced one solitary place in the holy scriptures which testified that either the lord himself or the apostles had ordered such a transfer of the sabbath to sunday then it was not easy to answer the question who has transferred the sabbath and who has had the right to do it
933730 the day is now changed from the seventh to the first day but as we meet with no scriptural direction for the change we may conclude it was done by the authority of the church
933731 the scriptures nowhere call the first day of the week the sabbath there is no scriptural authority for so doing nor of course any scriptural obligation
933732 there is no word no hint in the new testament about abstaining from work on sunday the observance of ash wednesday or lent stands exactly on the same footing as the observance of sunday into the rest of sunday no divine law enters
933733 and where are we told in the scriptures that we are to keep the first day at all we are commanded to keep the seventh but we are nowhere commanded to keep the first day
933734 it is true that there is no positive command for infant baptism nor is there any for keeping holy the first day of the week many believe that christ changed the sabbath but from his own words we see that he came for no such purpose those who believe that jesus changed the sabbath base it only on a supposition
933735 we have made the change from the seventh day to the first day from saturday to sunday on the authority of the one holy catholic apostolic church of christ
933736 the sacred name of the seventh day is sabbath this fact is too clear to require argument exodus 20 10 quoted on this point the plain teaching of the word has been admitted in all ages not once did the disciples apply the sabbath law to the first day of the week that folly was left for a later age nor did they pretend that the first day supplanted the seventh
933737 the current notion that christ and his apostles authoritatively substituted the first day for the seventh is absolutely without any authority in the new testament
933738 now there is no testimony in all the oracles of heaven that the sabbath is changed or that the lords day came in the room of it
933739 there is no direct scriptural authority for designating the first day the lords day
933740 to me it seems unaccountable that jesus during three years discussion with his disciples often conversing with upon the sabbath question discussing it in some of its various aspects freeing it from its false jewish traditional glosses never alluded to any transference of the day also that during the forty days of his resurrection life no such thing was intimated nor so far as we know did the spirit which was given to bring to their remembrance all things whatsoever that he had said unto them deal with this question nor yet did the inspired apostles in preaching the gospel founding churches counseling and instructing those founded discuss or approach the subject
933741 of course i quite well know that sunday did come into use in early christian history as a religious day as we learn from the christian fathers and other sources but what a pity that it comes branded with the mark of paganism and christened with the name of the sun god then adopted and sanctified by the papal apostasy and bequeathed as a sacred legacy to protestantism

933848 i would like to apologise to both the parents and family of heidi murphy for what i have done which caused her death
933849 my intention was only to steal because i was pushed by economic needs and the result of that burglary was meant to buy a ring and to fund my marriage
933850 i did that because both of my parents could not afford to give me this and i didnt expect at all that the incident would be something like this
933851 by gods name i didnt have any intention to do this
933852 in this criminal case the defendant clearly had no intention and purpose to kill so that sentence demanded by the prosecutor is unacceptable
933853 i admit to all my mistakes and i realise that my action has violated law which the consequence is jail for me
933854 i surrender mr judge even though it feels so heavy the punishment that i must bear because im aware that this is definitely not as sad as has been felt by both parents and the family of heidi murphy for losing the person they loved
933855 im also aware that my action has tainted and slander bali image as tourist destination
933856 please honorary judges consider being a little bit more lenient with me so that i can have the chance to improve my life and so that i can do good deeds to others for now and for the future
933857 i also beg and ask for the greatest forgiveness from the parents and family of heidi murphy who have lost their most loving daughter
933858 i also offer an apology to my own parents for causing this very deep pain
933859 i didnt know anything about the murder i only knew about the burglary

933897 es tracta no nom s de donar los el peix sin a pescar el que cal ja que tantes vegades als pa sos dacollida ens queixem que ve molta gent s veure que hi ha pa sos com el senegal que estan intentant fixar i retenir la seva poblaci ja que consideren que lemigraci s una p rdua de persones

933921 seguirem intentant trobar camins de col laboraci amb erc intentarem fer los entendre que aquesta manera daprovar el pam no s la adient per produir un canvi a la ciutat el canvi es produir per altres raons amb unes eleccions si capgirem la situaci dient quines s n les coses que cal canviar i no intentant tapar forats que s el que passa avui amb laprovaci del pam per anar aguantant

933968 i disagree with the assertion that developers are largely happy with their salaries
933969 companies work hard to keep their cash and typically only invest in the risky business of software when theres a lot more money to be made
933970 why put up with rubbish wages when you can earn more in another profession
933971 1 the reason most projects fail is down to the individual developers
933972 a real large chunk of em would do a bloody good job of it too
933973 its probably about right in terms of payment vs effort
933974 as for the roi argument i have to say there is a major management problem with the companies that behave the way youve described
933975 companies that undertake software projects with no thought to profits and then overpay developers to the point that theyre fat and happy are either doomed or up to something that we dont understand
933976 the fundamental problem ive seen in most projects is management

933981 it is obvious you havent worked in the industry for very long
933982 the incompetent programmers move on to become managers of some sort
933983 if you would run iq tests of everyone in a company and then compare them to salary i can guarantee that the programmers will turn out to be underpaid rather than overpaid
933984 programmers deserve blame though and they do so because they will accept doing dumb changes that lead to bad applications
933985 if i click to the left of this text the entire article and all text within it is marked in my firefox 2

933991 the system doesnt read minds and cant be made to do what you want if you cant get to grips with that were not going to waste your money pretending that it can
933992 a lot of that comes from the fact that many of the alt net crowd have made a living over the years cleaning up the aftermath of a mort attack i know i have i know firsthand that jeremy jeffrey scott and several others have also

934015 the international experience around shared ocean areas is that the international seabed authority has taken a very conservative approach and hasnt permitted companies to undertake these activities in international waters largely because they saw them as potentially very damaging
934016 for many of our mountain commuters it is the only form of transportation that these people have
934017 everything that we do is being undermined by the fuel crisis
934018 you would put a lot of people out of work if you took their bus away from them
934019 it takes time and privacy especially working out the methods which i wouldnt have guessed anyone really knew in the lab at that time
934020 people given these kinds of responsibilities with this kind of power at their fingertips we have to make sure that they are not likely to do harm to others or misuse that authority be it intentionally or be it because of some mental problem
934021 these kinds of situations cry out for reexamination of our standards
934022 youre basically going to scare off any scientist from wanting to work in this field if it becomes even more stringent
934023 it is a balance its a policy decision about how stringent we want to be
934024 in this area we must balance all reasonable conclusions with evidence that is backed up by proper statistical studies personally when i want to structure an argument regarding middle east e gaming development i look to the studies and conclusions of letterman yeater who was a pioneer in the field and highly regarded statistician

934038 during the phone conversation the freeze for freeze issue will not be discussed like the last talks in geneva they will only discuss the common points of the two packages
934039 mr solana will be in touch with the authorities of china france germany russia the united kingdom and the united states

934041 no matter how things are going we have always felt better when we have a turgenev a tolstoy a chekhov it is not enough for us for a writer to be a good writer even a great writer he has to be someone we can love
934042 in a century of false testimonies a writer becomes the witness to man
934043 of all the cells youve been in your first cell is a very special one the place where you first encountered others like yourself doomed to the same fate all your life you will remember it with an emotion that can only be compared to memories of your first love and those people with whom you shared the floor and air of that stone cubicle during the days when you rethought your entire life will later be recalled by you as members of your own family
934044 that autumn i learned from my own experience that a man can cross the threshold of death while occupying a body that is still not dead your blood still circulates and your stomach digests things but psychologically you have completed all your preparations for death and lived through death itself although you have never regarded yourself as a christian sometimes indeed the opposite now you suddenly notice that you have already forgiven everyone who has insulted you
934045 the line separating good from evil runs not between states not between classes and not between parties it runs through the heart of each and every one of us

934048 none of us who lived close to her perceived that she was that one righteous person without whom as the saying goes no city can stand nor our whole land
934049 a survival of the middle ages censorship has managed methuselah like to drag out its existence almost to the 21st century perishable it attempts to arrogate to itself the prerogative of imperishable time of separating good books from bad
934050 a burning question mark over 50 years of soviet power
934051 the time may come when we date the beginning of the collapse of the soviet system from the appearance of gulag
934052 its two quite specific areas and when you see them the way that we are funding the tax cut programme it is very clear and its not ambiguous
934053 everyone knows where the labour led government stands on the issues that matters there are no hidden agendas
934054 you will be in a position where nationals tax cut programme effectively when combined with our changes will be the same cost as labours
934055 any argument that national is borrowing for tax cuts well if that was the case then labours borrowing for tax cuts
934056 where was dr cullens anti debt hysteria then in fact he quietly slipped through these changes without mentioning them in his budget speech

934060 right now if you were to come up to the rink it would be completely wet inside
934061 because of the humidity we are plagued with rust mold and mildew
934062 with rising operating costs its more and more difficult for arenas to manage day to day maintenance
934063 as arenas provide nova scotians with opportunities to be physically active our investment will help these facilities remain sustainable to continue to provide the best service possible to communities
934064 it will eliminate buildup of condensation drips on the ice which can be a liability issue someone could trip over one and fall

934070 i have the flight plan and the flight path from the aircrafts gps and it is well within the boundary of our operation the drop was no closer than 70 metres up to the boundary we totally refute the allegations that there was an overfly
934071 we discovered the animals and he mr le brun discovered the baits and we put him onto where the animals were one was a deer one was a pig we actually found more dead deer than possums
934072 weve got video of 1080 pellets in the water its a side creek that leads in to teme stream which flows into the avon and the waihopai river which is used for grapeland irrigation
934073 they only show where theyve flown when they press the button to drop the hopper when they open the hopper thats when the gps operates
934074 they didnt die from pellets in a water catchment area what weve done is gone in walked all through that area and recovered any carcasses to mitigate any risk whatsoever to the water supply
934075 low entry into universities translates to low penetration in the job market leaving the men to dominate key sectors of the economy such as finance technology and engineering
934076 it is not possible for me to wait for a women with the right skills to take up a position while there is a man at hand who is qualified it does not make business sense
934077 scams are not new thats why the committee works hard to ensure people choose to buy their tickets through reputable agencies
934078 regrettably some people believe they can save some money by going elsewhere and they put themselves at risk while doing so
934079 we regret that but there is no shortcut in the process
934080 but they can usually only be reactive rather than proactive with these things and that means people get burned in the process
934081 weve managed to get them all general tickets although theyve still lost money in the process
934082 tickets have long sold out but there are always ways with our friends who are official ticket people for other national olympic committees
934083 we swap with each other we can work it out we will do our very best to try and get tickets for those distressed parents
934084 that site is the biggest scam in the world they have made millions of dollars worldwide
934085 they are based out of arizona somewhere and are being sued by the united states olympic committee if they can even find them
934086 they are a complete fraud and anybody who gave them money off their website to unofficial people really are taking a hell of a risk
934087 we have only just had the tickets issued to us by bocog the games organising committee and bocog will not let us courier tickets out of china
934088 we have set up an office in the new zealand embassy in beijing and we have informed people that they have to come there at allocated times to pick up their tickets
934089 i have already paid for the flights and accommodation and i have managed to get a few tickets to a few events but obviously the tickets that i bought through this website are gone

934318 what was a poor choice in 2006 is still a poor choice in 2008 we still cant drill our way out of this energy situation which we admit is serious
934319 i feel relatively optimistic that good sense will prevail again the economics are really not there this will not make oil cheaper
934320 its still always a bit of a hit or miss as far as what types of reserves you hit you can have the right geology but history just didnt deposit the right materials that would store a lot so its still quite an unknown

934428 thousands of americans get detained and inconvenienced daily because of watch list errors
934429 misidentifications can lead to delays intensive questioning and searches missed flights or denied entry at the border
934430 runs quality assurance checks on watch list data every day
934431 the records of individuals who have frequent encounters with the watch list will be automatically reviewed by the terrorist screening center even if no redress complaint is submitted
934432 allow the federal government instead of individual airlines to compare passenger data against the watch lists prior to check in at the airport while fully protecting privacy and civil liberties
934433 a new record is created for every alias date of birth passport and other identifying information for watch listed suspects
934434 reserved for known or suspected terrorists that reach a threshold where they should not be allowed to fly or should get additional scrutiny
934435 unfortunately egg headed thinking like this muddies the waters to the point where the no fly list and selectee lists become virtually worthless garbage in garbage out
934436 these lists are not comprehensive and not centralized some subjects appear on one list but not the others some of the lists are old and not current we are really confused
934437 who besides tsa thinks that any terrorist anywhere still believes that they can hijack a plane anymore
934438 me and a million others are on the no fly list
934439 if the tsa can fix the list with better technology why doesnt that happen

934450 we are looking at customers in the asia pacific region there is great potential as with a facility in malaysia the turbo props do not need to fly to europe to be serviced
934451 the large aircraft orders coupled with the lack of mro for turbo prop aircraft in asia would position this company to become a key mro provider for the turbo props

934467 atheists base their reasoning on quantum interpretation hand in hand with mathematical elucidation summoning the dark forces of quantum mysticism with mathematical incantations scientists possess the power to bewilder and thus con the average person seemingly at will into believing the bizarre and surreal for example imaginary z particles neutrinos leptons quarks weak bosons etc mystics attempt to pass off quantum abuse as legitimate science by expressing the theories in symbolic fashion these formulae represent the greatest hoax ever perpetuated upon an unsuspecting public the objective of the extensive investigation is to expedite the return to physical science by exposing quantum dirty tricks that is the unethical behavior or acts by the scientific league to undermine and destroy the credibility of biblical histories a few of the dirty tricks include absolute dating systems big bang theory antimatter and the oort cloud of comets these have no further station in science of course a more sophisticated way to argue against darwinism is certainly to argue against quantum physics without modern physics you lose astrophysics too which enables the author to make the case for yec young earth creationism the author goes on to prove that things like red supergiant stars and x ray pulsars dont really exist except in the imagination of scientists
934468 there is no material time left eight days is not enough to pass a law the administration should not even attempt to railroad this because it has given no clear and acceptable reasons for postponing the elections
934469 malacanang should focus instead on the most important concern ensure the safety of voters candidates teachers and other poll workers and volunteers and most importantly protect public confidence in the new automated elections violence must not lead to a failure in the armm elections
934470 by railroading the postponement of the elections without even giving any viable reason the administration is asking us to dispense with the armm voters constitutional right to suffrage
934471 what theyve said so far is that the postponement is crucial in finally concluding the peace talks with the milf the senate has yet to see anything that will justify this reason

934477 usually its the case that you come into training first thing in the morning get your head down and get the work done and then early afternoon its wrapped up and thats the end of that
934478 this summer its been different though weve been working full days its been a taste of the nine to five for us
934479 the days have been long and hard with the emphasis on getting us into peak condition by the time the season kicks off
934480 its always tough this time of the year but i honestly dont think ive ever been worked as hard in a pre season as i have this summer
934481 the fact that im coming back from injury hasnt made a difference theres been no hiding place for anyone
934482 even if ive not been able to play a full part in some sessions its not been a case of sitting it out theres been other things to keep me occupied
934483 its been a bit of a war zone in the dressing room after training at times
934484 theres not been much said as everybody has been too worn out but weve all known exactly what the others have been thinking
934485 getting injured when i did was very frustrating particularly as it meant i missed the edf final against leicester
934486 then after doing so well in the six nations i had to sit at home when wales went to south africa
934487 but i had to undergo surgery which went very well rehab was good ive hit all my targets since then so im optimistic that ill be back in an ospreys shirt on schedule
934488 having won the edf cup last time well want to defend that title while we have to be looking at going the next step in europe
934489 we cant just be satisfied with a losing quarter final this time weve got over the hurdle of the group stages now
934490 weve had a taste of the knockouts now and the next challenge is to show that we can handle those occasions and win these big games
934491 the win over leicester at twickenham was a big psychological thing for us it sent out a message that we were able to handle the pressure now we have to show it wasnt a one off
934492 if we want to win the heineken cup then we have to face up to the challenge and beat the best sides on the way so we have to approach it in a positive manner
934493 andrew hore is very innovative thinker always looking at ways that he can make a difference and help to improve the players and the coaches
934494 jonathan and sean holley are very similar to him in the way they approach training and squad sessions
934495 weve spent a lot of time over the summer working on ways to find the extra five per cent to turn us from contenders to champions
934496 the difference between winning and losing can sometimes be about what goes on in the head more than what is happening on the pitch

934532 we do not currently have a release date for either starcraft ii or diablo iii but we can say that they are heavily in development on both games and we are committed to making sure these games meet and exceed the high expectations of our players
934533 the original diablo has been widely credited with helping to revitalize the role playing game genre combined previous games in the series have sold over 18 5 million copies worldwide as with starcraft ii diablo iii will benefit greatly from our revamped online game service battle net since the focus will be on cooperative online play

934546 we intend to expand the capacity of our second plant from 1 00 000 units to 2 00 000 units in the near future

934550 one begins to see that if the chaos reports statistics are true the prospects are somewhat alarming
934551 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
934552 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of yahoos keyword list

934566 backdrop of serious threat posed by terrorism to security and stability of afghanistan india and the region
934567 the attack on our embassy in kabul on july 7 has tragically shown that terrorism has no barriers and is not bound by restraints
934568 it was an attack on the friendship between india and afghanistan
934569 but as far as the games are concerned we trust the authorities are doing everything humanly possible to ensure a safe and secure event
934570 we shouldnt automatically make any link to the games if the authorities decide it is necessary to brief us they will
934571 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
934572 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
934573 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
934574 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
934575 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
934576 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

934586 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
934587 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law

934592 there has been a marked increase in black economy activities during the economic slowdown with numerous companies complaining to isme that they are being undercut by rogue operators
934593 it is extremely difficult to put an accurate figure on the actual cost of such activities and estimates range from 7 5 to 15 8 of gnp
934594 isme estimates that core black economy activities could account for up to 11 of gnp which would equate to over 17
934595 to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole this system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences the apex of the system was to be the bank for international settlements in basel switzerland a private bank owned and controlled by the worlds central banks which were themselves private corporations each central bank sought to dominate its government by its ability to control treasury loans to manipulate foreign exchanges to influence the levels of economic activity in the country and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world
934596 who are able to govern credit and its allotment for this reason supplying so to speak the life blood to the entire economic body and grasping as it were in their hands the very soul of the economy so that no one dare breathe against their will
934597 i can tell you right now that there is going to be a crash of unprecedented proportions a crash like we have never seen before in this country the greatest shock of this decade is that more people are about to loose more money then at any time before in history but the second greatest shock will be the incredible amount of money a relatively small group of people will make at the same time you see in periods of economic upheaval in periods of economic crisis wealth is not destroyed it is merely transferred
934598 right now its perpetuated by the federal reserve making us borrow the money from them at interest to pay the interest thats already accumulated so we cannot get out of debt the way were going now
934599 no not when you are adding roughly a billion dollars a day we just cant go on we had less than 1 trillion dollars of national debt in 1980 now its 5 trillion 5 times greater in 15 years it just doesnt take a genius to realize that this just cant go on forever
934600 thats exactly correct the fed is privately owned for profit corporation which has no reserves at least no reserve to back up the federal reserve ot which are our common currency
934601 this miracle of speediness never equaled before or after in the u s congress is ominously comparable to the rubber stamp lawmaking of the banana republics
934602 the federal reserve system is a legal private monopoly of the money supply operated for the benefit of the few under the guise of protecting and promoting the public intent
934603 the financial system has been turned over to the federal reserve board that board administers the finance system by authority of a purely profiteering group the system is private conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other peoples money
934604 we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known i refer to the federal reserve board this evil institution has impoverished the people of the united states and has practically bankrupted our government it has done this through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it
934605 most americans have no real understanding of the operation of the international moneylenders the accounts of the federal reserve system have never been audited it operates outside the control of congress and manipulates the credit of the united states
934606 the fed really is more powerful than the federal government it is more powerful than the president congress or the courts let me prove my case the fed determines what the average persons car payment and house paymentis goingto be and whether they have a job or not and i submit to you that is total control the fed is the largest single creditor of the u s government what does proverbs tell us the borrower is servant to the lender
934607 i sincerely believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies already they have raised up a money aristocracy that has set the government at defiance the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
934608 history records that the money changers have used every form of abuse intrigue deceit and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and its issuance
934609 an efficient literary bureau is needed not for a day or a crisis but a permanent healthy control of the associated press and kindred avenues it will cost money but will be cheapest in the end
934610 there is no such thing as an independent press in america if we expect that of little country towns you know this and i know it not a man among you dares to utter his honest opinion were you to utter it you know beforehand that it would never appear in print i am paid one hundred and fifty dollars a week so that i may keep my honest opinion out of the newspaper for which i write you too are paid similar salaries for similar services were i to permit that a single edition of my newspaper contained an honest opinion my occupation like othellos would be gone in less than twenty four hours the man who would be so foolish as to write his honest opinion would soon be on the streets in search of another job it is the duty of a new york journalist to lie to distort to revile to toady at the feet of mammon and to sell his country and his race for his daily bread or what amounts to the same thing his salary we are the tools and the vassals of the rich behind the scenes we are marionettes these men pull the strings and we dance our time our talents our lives our capacities are all the property of these men we are intellectual prostitutes
934611 in march 1915 the j p morgan interests the steel shipbuilding and powder interests and their subsidiary organizations got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employed them to select the most influential newspapers in the united states and sufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press they found it was only necessary to purchase the control of 25 of the greatest papers an agreement was reached the policy of the papers was bought to be paid for by the month an editor was furnished for each paper to properly supervise and edit information regarding the questions of preparedness militarism financial policies and other things of national and international nature considered vital to the interests of the purchasers
934612 so far as can be learned the rockefellers have given up their old policy of owning newspapers and magazines outright relying now upon the publications of all camps to serve their best interests in return for the vast volume of petroleum and allied advertising under rockefeller control after the j p morgan bloc the rockefellers have the most advertising of any group to dispose of and when advertising alone is not suficient to insure the fealty of a newspaper the rockefeller companies have been known to make direct payments in return for a friendly editorial attitude
934613 sorrow is knowledge they who know he most must mourn the deepest oer the fatal truth the tree of knowledge is not that of life
934614 rags make paper paper makes money money makes banks banks make loans loans make beggars beggars make rags
934615 are a bright joy as brittle as glass accompanied by the haunting fear of a sudden break
934616 in theory still a real monarch although in reality only a convenient puppet to be used by the cabinet the city at pleasure to suit their awn ends not able even to exercise the power of pardon that is a prerogative of a governor of an american state and of the president of the united states
934617 democracy has no more persistent and insidious foe than the money powers
934618 questions regarding the bank of england its conduct and its objects be not allowed by the speaker
934619 there is something behind the throne greater than the king himself
934620 the world is governed by very different personages from what is imagined by those who are not behind the scenes
934621 the real truth of the matter is as you and i know that a financial element in the large centers has owned government ever since the days of andrew jackson
934622 there are two things which are intrinsic not just to the bank of england but to central banking generally the first is an involvement in the formation of monetary policy with the specific objective of achieving monetary stability
934623 there is evidence that when the five brothers spread out to the five provinces of the financial empire of europe they had some secret help for the accumulation of these enormous sums
934624 money is the god of our times and rothschild is his prophet
934625 kings couldnt afford this it could only belong to a rothschild
934626 there is but one power in europe and that is rothschild
934627 conquered the world more thoroughly more cunningly and much more lastingly than all the caesars before
934628 that is simple in the colonies we issue our own money it is called colonial scrip we issue it in proper proportion to the demands of trade and industry to make the products pass easily from the producers to the consumers in this manner creating for ourselves our own paper money we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay to no one
934629 in one year the conditions were so reversed that the era of prosperity ended and a depression set in to such an extent that the streets of the colonies were filled with unemployed
934630 the colonies would gladly have borne the little tax on tea and other matters had it not been that england took away from the colonies their money which created unemployment and dissatisfaction
934631 thus the bills of credit ie paper money which historians with ignorance or prejudice have belittled as instruments of reckless financial policy were really the standards of the revolution they were more than this they were the revolution itself
934632 a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon of provisions
934633 this institution having no principle but that of avarice will never be varied in its object to engross all the wealth power and influence of the state
934634 if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and the corporations which grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered
934635 the rich will strive to establish their dominion and enslave the rest they always did they always will they will have the same effect here as elsewhere if we do not by the power of government keep them in their proper spheres
934636 it was moved and seconded to strike out words and emit bills of credit and the motion passed in the affirmative
934637 let me issue and control a nations money and i care not who writes its laws
934638 a national debt if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing
934639 never was a great historic event followed by a more feeble sequel a nation arises to claim for itself liberty and sovereignty it gains both of these by immense sacrifice of blood and treasure then when victory is gained and secure it hands the nation s credit that is to say a national treasure over to private individuals to do as they please with
934640 under the surface the rothschilds long had a powerful influence in dictating american financial laws the law records show that they were the power in the old bank of the united states
934641 i wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our constitution taking from the federal government the power of borrowing
934642 the hand that gives is above the hand that takes money has no motherland financiers are without patriotism and without decency their sole object is gain
934643 will have planted in the bosom of this constitution a viper which one day or another will sting the liberties of this country to the heart
934644 it is certainly no exaggeration to say that the second bank of the united states was rooted as deeply in britain as it was in america
934645 it is not our own citizens only who are to receive the bounty of our government more than eight millions of the stock of this bank are held by foreigners it is easy to conceive that great evils to our country and its institutions might flow from such a concentration of power in the hands of a few irresponsible to the people is there no danger to our liberty and independence in a bank that in its nature has so little to bind it to our country controlling our currency receiving our public moneys and holding thousands of our citizens in dependence would be more formidable and dangerous than a military power of the enemy it is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes if government would confine itself to equal protection and as heaven does its rains shower its favor alike on the high and the low the rich and the poor it would be an unqualified blessing in the act before me there seems to be a wide and unnecessary departure from these just principles many of our rich men have not been content with equal protection and equal benefits but have besought us to make them richer by act of congress if we can not at once in justice to interests vested under improvident legislation make our government what it ought to be we can at least take a stand against all new grants of monopolies and exclusive privileges against any prostitution of our government to the advancement of the few at the expense of the many and in favor of compromise and gradual reform in our code of laws and system of political economy i have now done my duty to my country if sustained by my fellow citizens i shall be grateful and happy if not i shall find in the motives which impel me ample grounds for contentment and peace in the difficulties which surround us and the dangers which threaten our institutions there is cause for neither dismay nor alarm for relief and deliverance let us firmly rely on that kind providence which i am sure watches with peculiar wisdom over our countrymen through his abundant goodness and their patriotic devotion our liberty and union win be preserved
934646 if congress has the right to issue paper money it was given them to be used by themselves and not to be delegated to individuals or corporations
934647 i have it chained i am ready with screws to draw every tooth and then the stumps
934648 this worthy president thinks that because he has scalped indians and imprisoned judges he is to have his way with the bank he is mistaken
934649 nothing but widespread suffering will produce any effect on congress our only safety is in pursuing a steady course of firm monetary restriction and i have no doubt that such a course will ultimately lead to restoration of the currency and the re charter of the bank
934650 you are a den of vipers i intend to rout you out and by the eternal god i will rout you out
934651 the bold effort the present bank had made to control the government the distress it had wantonly produced are but premonitions of the fate that awaits the american people should they be deluded into a perpetuation of this institution or the establishment of another like it
934652 i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it now exists i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so
934653 my paramount objective is to save the union and it is not either to save or destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it
934654 it is not to be doubted i know of absolute certainty
934655 that the division of the united states into two federations of equal power was decided long before the civil war by the high financial powers of europe these bankers were afraid that the united states if they remained as one block and were to develop as one nation would attain economic and financial independence which would upset the capitalist domination of europe over the world
934656 why lincoln that is easy just get congress to pass a bill authorizing the printing of full legal tender treasury notes pay your soldiers with them and go ahead and win your war with them also
934657 the people or anyone else will not have any choice in the matter if you make them full legal tender
934658 the government should create issue and circulate all the currency and credit needed to satisfy the spending power of the government and the buying power of consumers the privilege of creating and issuing money is not only the supreme prerogative of government but it is the governments greatest creative opportunity by the adoption of these principles the long felt want for a uniform medium will be satisfied the taxpayers will be saved immense sums of interest the financing of all public enterprises and the conduct of the treasury will become matters of practical administration money will cease to be master and become the servant of humanity
934659 if this mischievous financial policy which has its origin in north america shall become endurated down to a fixture then the government will furnish its own money without cost it will pay off debts and be without debt it will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce it will become prosperous without precedent in the history of the world the brains and wealth of all countries will go to north america that country must be destroyed or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe
934660 they persist they have argued me almost blind i am worse off than st paul he was in a strait between two i am in a strait between twenty and they are bankers and financiers
934661 rothschild brothers bankers london june 25th 1863 messrs ikleheimer morton and vandergould no 3 wall st new york us a dear sirs a mr john sherman has written us from a town in ohio u s a as to the profits that may be made in the national banking business under a recent act of your congress a copy of which act accompanied his letter apparently this act has been drawn upon the plan formulated here last summer by the british bankers association and by that association recommended to our american friends as one that if enacted into law would prove highly profitable to the banking fraternity throughout the world mr sherman declares that there has never been such an opportunity for capitalists to accumulate money as that presented by this act and that the old plan of state banks is so unpopular that the new scheme will by contrast be most favorably regarded notwithstanding the fact that it gives the national banks an almost absolute control of the national finance the few who can understand the system he says will either be so interested in its profits or so dependent of its favors that there will be no opposition from that class while on the other hand the great body of people mentally incapable of comprehending the tremendous advantages that capital derives from the system will bear its burdens without complaint and perhaps without even suspecting that the system is inimical to their interests please advise fully as to this matter and also state whether or not you will be of assistance to us if we conclude to establish a national bank in the city of new york if you are acquainted with mr sherman he appears to have introduced the banking act we will be glad to know something of him if we avail ourselves of the information he furnished we will of course make due compensation awaiting your reply we are your respectful servants rothschild brothers
934662 in numerous years following the war the federal government ran a heavy surplus it could not however pay off its debt retire its securities because to do so meant there would be no bonds to back the national bank notes to pay off the debt was to destroy the money supply
934663 the money power preys upon the nation in times of peace and conspires against it in times of adversity it is more despotic than monarchy more insolent than autocracy more selfish than bureaucracy i see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country corporations have been enthroned an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is destroyed
934664 my agency in promoting the passage of the national banking act was the greatest financial mistake in my life it has built up a monopoly which affects every interest in the country
934665 the death of lincoln was a disaster for christendom there was no man in the united states great enough to wear his boots
934666 abraham lincoln was assassinated through the machinations of a group representative of the international bankers who feared the united states presidents national credit ambitions there was only one group in the world at that time who had any reason to desire the death of lincoln they were the men opposed to his national currency programme and who had fought him throughout the whole civil war on his policy of greenback currency
934667 they were the men interested in the establishment of the gold standard and the right of the bankers to manage the currency and credit of every nation in the world with lincoln out of the way they were able to proceed with the plan and did proceed with it in the united states within eight years after lincolns assassination silver was demonetized and the gold standard money system set up in the united states
934668 right after the civil war there was considerable talk about reviving lincolns brief experiment with the constitutional monetary system had not the european money trust intervened it would have no doubt become an established institution
934669 the hard times which occurred after the civil war could have been avoided if the greenback legislation had continued as president lincoln had intended instead there were a series of money panics what we call recessions which put pressure on congress to enact legislation to place the banking system under centralized control eventually the federal reserve act was passed on december 23 1913
934670 warning ruin to those who might oppose the payment of u s bonds in coin or who might advocate their liquidation in greenbacks
934671 i went to america in the winter of 1872 73 authorized to secure if i could the passage of a bill demonetizing silver it was in the interest of those i represented the governors of the bank of england to have it done
934672 the disaster of the dark ages was caused by decreasing money and falling prices without money civilization could not have had a beginning and with a diminishing supply it must languish and unless relieved finally perish at the christian era the metallic money of the roman empire amounted to 1 800 000 000 bythe end of the fifteenth century it had shrunk to less than s200 000 000 history records no other such disastrous transition as that from the roman empire to the dark ages
934673 it is advisable to do all in your power to sustain such prominent daily and weekly newspapers especially the agricultural and religious press as will oppose the greenback issue of paper money and that you will also withhold patronage from all applicants who are not willing to oppose the government issue of money to repeal the act creating bank notes or to restore to circulation the government issue of money will be to provide the people with money and will therefore seriously affect our individual profits as bankers and lenders see your congressman at once and engage him to support our interests that we may control legislation
934674 the capital of the country organized at last i e the national banks and we will see whether congress will dare to fly in its face
934675 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce and when you realize that the entire system is very easily controlled one way or another by a few powerful men at the top you will not have to be told how periods of inflation and depression originate
934676 on sept 1 1894 we will not renew our loans under any consideration on sept 1st we will demand our money we will foreclose and become mortgagees in possession we can take two thirds of the farms west of the mississippi and thousands of them east of the mississippi as well at our own price we may as well own three fourths of the farms of the west and the money of the country then the farmers will become tenants as in england
934677 we will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of old
934678 the right to coin and issue money is a function of government it is a part of sovereignty and cannot with safety be delegated to private individuals
934679 that is the one thing in my public career that i regret my work to secure the enactment of the federal reserve law
934680 morgans activities in 1895 1896 in selling u s gold bonds in europe were based on his alliance with the house of rothschild
934681 the kind of place god would have built if he had had the money
934682 their secret is that they have annexed from governments monarchies and republics the power to create the world s money on debt terms requiring tribute both in principal and interest
934683 all this trouble could be averted if we appointed a committee of six or seven public spirited men like j p morgan to handle the affairs of our country
934684 with its alarming epidemic of bank failures the country was fed up once and for all with the anarchy of unstable private banking
934685 the money trust caused the 1907 panic those not favorable to the money trust could be squeezed out of business and the people frightened into demanding changes in the banking and currency laws which the money trust would frame
934686 i was as secretive indeed as furtive as any conspirator discovery we knew simply must not happen or else all our time and effort would be wasted if it were to be exposed that our particular group had got together and written a banking bill that bill would have no chance whatever of passage by congress
934687 before passage of this act the new york bankers could only dominate the reserves of new york now we are able to dominate the bank reserves of the entire county
934688 the aldrich plan is the wall street plan it means another panic if necessary to intimidate the people aldrich paid by the government to represent the people proposes a plan for the trusts instead
934689 issue of currency should be lodged with the government and be protected from domination by wall street we are opposed to the aldrich bill because its provisions would place our currency and credit system in private hands
934690 the aldrich bill was condemned in the platform when woodrow wilson was nominated the men who ruled the democratic party promised the people that if they were returned to power there would be no central bank established here while they held the reins of government thirteen months later that promise was broken and the wilson administration under the tutelage of those sinister wall street figures who stood behind colonel house established here in our free country the worm eaten monarchical institution of the kings bank to control us from the top downward and to shackle us from the cradle to the grave
934691 brushing aside the external differences affecting the shells we find the kernels of the two systems very closely resembling and related to one another
934692 from farm boy to financier although the aldrich federal reserve plan was defeated when it bore the name aldrich nevertheless its essential points were all contained in the plan that finally was adopted
934693 the bill grants just what wall street and the big bas for twenty five years have been striving for private instead of public control of currency it the glass owen bill does this as completely as the aldrich bill both measures rob the government and the people of all effective control over the publics money and vest in the banks exclusively the dangerous power to make money among the people scarce or plenty
934694 there are bankers in this country who are enemies of the public welfare
934695 this act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth when the president signs this bill the invisible government by the monetary power will be legalized the people may not know it immediately but the day of reckoning is only a few years removed the worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking bill
934696 to cause high prices all the federal reserve board will do will be to lower the rediscount rate producing an expansion of credit and a rising stock market then when business men are adjusted to these conditions it can check prosperity in mid career by arbitrarily raising the rate of interest it can cause the pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth by slight changes in the discount rate or cause violent fluctuations by a greater rate variation and in either case it will possess inside information as to financial conditions and advance knowledge of the coming change either up or down this is the strangest most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privilege class by any government that ever existed they know in advance when to create panics to their advantage they also know when to stop panic inflation and deflation work equally well for them when they control finance
934697 already the federal reserve banks have cornered the gold and gold certificates
934698 a super state controlled by international bankers and international industrialists acting together to enslave the world for their own pleasure
934699 in the united states today we have in effect two governments we have the duly constituted government then we have an independent uncontrolled and uncoordinated government in the federal reserve system operating the money powers which are reserved to congress by the constitution
934700 if our nation can issue a dollar bond it can issue a dollar bill the element that makes the bond good makes the bill good also it is absurd to say that our country can issue 30 million in bonds and not 30 million in currency both are promises to pay but one promise fattens the usurers and the other helps the people
934701 we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled governments in the civilized world no longer a government offree opinion no longer a government by a vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men some of the biggest men in the united states in the field of commerce and manufacture are afraid of something they know that there is a power somewhere so organized so subtle so watchful so interlocked so complete so pervasive that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it
934702 no government should permit such coercive power over its own credit to be held by any one group or class as the privately owned federal reserve system holds today no government should delegate to private interests the control over the purchasing power of money the issue must be faced and settled there can be no complete restoration of confidence until the conflict between private and government control over money is ended
934703 if one understands that socialism is not a share the wealth program but is in reality a method to consolidate and control the wealth then the seeming paradox of super rich men promoting socialism becomes no paradox at all instead it becomes logical even the perfect tool for power seeking megalomaniacs communism or more accurately socialism is not a movement of the downtrodden masses but of the economic elite
934704 power from any source tends to create an appetite for additional power it was almost inevitable that the super rich would one day aspire to control not only their own wealth but the wealth of the whole world to achieve this they were perfectly willing to feed the ambitions of the power hungry political conspirators who were committed to the overthrow of all existing governments and the establishment of a central world wide dictatorship
934705 political power grows out of the barrel of a gun
934706 the state does not function as we desired the car does not obey a man is at the wheel and seems to lead it but the car does not drive in the desired direction it moves as another force wishes
934707 the course of russian history has indeed been greatly affected by the operations of international bankers the soviet government has been given united states treasury funds by the federal reserve board acting through the chase bank england has drawn money from us through the federal reserve banks and has re lent it at high rates of interest to the soviet government the dnieperstory dam was built with funds unlawfully taken from the united states treasury by the corrupt and dishonest federal reserve board and the federal reserve banks
934708 straight back into the coffers of western banks in debt service
934709 when you know a thing to recognize that you know it and when you do not to know that you do not know this is knowledge
934710 for what will it profit men that a more prudent distribution and use of riches make it possible for them to gain even the whole world if thereby they suffer the loss of their own souls
934711 we dont index every one of those trillion pages many of them are similar to each other or represent auto generated content similar to the calendar example that isnt very useful to searchers but were proud to have the most comprehensive index of any search engine and our goal always has been to index all the worlds data

934720 to give a fair chance to potential creativity is a matter of life and death of any society this is important because the outstanding creative ability of a smaller percentage of the population is mankinds ultimate capital asset

934751 most importantly the unknown number of women with hiv infection who are giving birth undiagnosed emphasises the need to ensure all women have access to hiv testing and the potential benefits for their health and the health of their babies
934752 hiv develops resistance very rapidly and once that happens drugs dont work as well as they theoretically should or they stop working altogether
934753 physicians routinely have the patients virus tested for resistance in advance of treatment to help make the appropriate clinical decisions
934754 the focus has been on specific areas of the hiv genome where we expect these resistance conferring mutations to occur
934755 we focus on a particular sequence on an important gene from amino acid 1 to 300 and as such we miss roughly a third of this gene until recently most researchers believed that this hidden area was of little clinical significance

934786 in countries with low prevalence of initial multi drug resistance the standardized treatment regimens for new case appear to be adequate
934787 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to re evaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
934788 we hypothesized that in countries using standardized initial and retreatment regimens the proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes would be correlated with prevalence of initial and acquired multi drug resistance

934803 we will inform the ministry of higher and tertiary education by monday of our intention to go on strike indefinitely if our grievances are not met
934804 the lecturers want their salaries pegged at the prevailing interbank rate or us 1 200 for the least paid and this is a big climb down from the us 2 000 that we had asked from the ministry
934805 the government demonstrated that it had the ability to meet these demands and we are not going back to work until they are met

934811 you teach in the way you were taught and for some thats a very undergraduate style very directive at a business school you need to be more facilitative you are dealing with adults with business experience i did my mba at uct and my method was probably very similar to that of the lecturer i got the most out of but i also got pointers on how productive you are in class how to use the floor space you can get locked into one vision of a good teacher but the course shows you there are many good teachers who use the same method but have different styles also we could exchange ideas and talk
934812 case studies help the class deal with actual decision points its not just a theoretical story the teaching happens where the insight emerges about how you make decisions
934813 we realised several things our african business schools research capabilities were low our teaching capacity was low and so was our quality assurance we didnt have executive training in business schools in sub saharan africa except sa and where we did have them they were too theoretical to be attractive to businessmen with the exception of lagos business school

934820 lies firmly at the feet of employers bodies who are determined to stall any pay increases at any cost ibec were fully aware of what the failure to reach an outcome this weekend would mean
934821 by telling their members not to engage in local collective bargaining they are laying the foundations for serious industrial unrest in this country they must behave in a responsible manner especially when you consider they were a key part of why the negotiations failed
934822 the suspect whom we cannot name for being a juvenile together with others attacked and injured their colleagues on july 7 he was charged at kabale magistrates court

934883 oh reina and gaki san were chasing eachother down the halls and i ran into one of them and the other stepped on my glasses

934901 why should you be thinking about koharu when you should be worrying about me the groping demon of hello project
934902 come now you know that was just a stunt to get me out
934903 right now the only one in my sights is you my dear ai chan
934904 i have done everything i know how to do my dog still isnt behaving i am soooo frustrated ps its all his fault
934905 nobody in the history of the world has ever even conceived of making this much less actually made it
934906 i think i speak for the entire bullpen when i say that were going to give up more homers and big hits especially when we have a lead
934907 ill just keep throwing my limited repertoire of poorly located pitches with predictable velocity and make sure no batters feel intimidated when they step in against me all i can do is put us in a position to lose if the team can score less than three runs im pretty sure ill be a bust the rest of the way out
934908 ive set up the pitching rotation with a bunch of guys who are either too young or too old 40 year old perpetually injured tom gordon is the key to our bullpen were always depending on 45 year old jamie moyer to give us seven innings hamels chiropractor who gets paid more than hamels ha ha ha says his astrological chart looks pretty bad for august so that helps us lose enough of the duct tape and pocket lint have fallen off of this b list staff that were headed for the bottom of the division you wont hear anybody saying cy young and phillies in the same sentence thanks to me
934909 youd think 55 homers and 150 rbi would help us win but if i can keep up my throwing errors in crucial situations well probably lose enough to just miss the wild card
934910 if youre a player i used to be your best buddy rasslin and jokin around now im general george s patton they used to have fun but now our clubhouse is like a bunch a long tailed cats in a room full of rockin chairs just gotta keep em real tense like a drought waitin for the lady rain heck the phils will probably drop the club option next year and ill be back makin la z boys in virginny
934911 i either pitch great or im horrible i cant seem to get right in the middle see thats what we need from me a mediocre start that keeps me from getting yanked early if the guys help me out by keeping their bats real quiet i can turn my quality starts into losses i dont want to pitch too well you know its not like im getting a rod money or anything if i pull a burrell next year and win 20 in the final year of my contract somebodys gonna throw 14 mil or so my way and its not gonna be these cheapskate phillies owners
934912 hoo baby did you see that pitch he got right up in his kitchen i mean the guys lookin for a pitch to hit you know something right in his wheelhouse so he could just turn on that baby and rip a laser into the gap but instead hes on his back chokin on dust that pitch was in his outhouse maybe even in his powder room and it broke the mirror and knocked the air freshener right into the trash can then he throws the next pitch right up into his home theater entertainment room and it ended up stuck in his miele stackable washer and dryer yeah he was trying to go middle in with that hard slider and have it tail in on the hands of the lefty and he just left it up belt high and i mean it got crushed that ball was surf and turf served up on a gold platter with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for dessert he had to put on a bib and a pair of cufflinks to hit that baby
934913 wheels is going to go into the back room and hyperventilate for a few minutes i give the phillies two chances to win the division slim and none and slim just left town watch this season go outta here

934935 een eerste reden ligt in de priv sfeer zoals geweten wil ik kindjes niet n maar meerdere en eens je mijn leeftijd hebt wacht je dan best niet te lang meer daarnaast heb ik ook al alles verwezenlijkt wat ik eigenlijk nooit had durven dromen de laatste tijd voel ik ook dat mijn lichaam wat begint tegen te pruttelen met verschillende kleine kwaaltjes door de beslissing nu bekend te maken anticipeer ik ook op de telkens terugkomende vraag en kan ik mij volledig op de spelen concentreren
934936 mogelijk doe ik er nog een winterseizoen bij voor ik helemaal stop maar de kans is klein het hangt ervan af hoe ik me in november voel de reden waarom ik er nog een winterseizoen zou bij doen is om de overgang wat smoother te laten verlopen

934984 we cannot accept people paying money for tickets and not getting them
934985 they have known about these sites for months and months and did nothing
934986 they have dashed the hopes and dreams of thousands of people who have been planning for years to go the games and have already paid thousands of dollars for airfare and what they thought were legitimate tickets
934987 our sympathy goes to them but we certainly arent in a position to step in compensate or find other tickets
934988 we warned folk to only deal with authorized ticket suppliers
934989 the worst thing is that some people dont even know yet that they bought tickets that wont arrive
934990 some were told they could pick up the tickets at an office in beijing and they wont be there my guess is they sold thousands of tickets that dont exist
934991 there may be tickets on ebay that are delivered but i think it is a great risk that would be my message
934992 i think we all knew that there are so many and they are playing so well and consistently and working so hard
934993 now we can see that the asian tour is becoming very strong the top players are coming to the states and they can also win in the states before it was a different story

935031 but its hard for him to accept because he has no control over who heather dates

935104 ikke alene var han en stor forfatter men hans forfatterskab var med til at undergrave det stalinistiske system og sovjetunionen
935105 derved blev han blev en samtidig en skikkelse med en betydelig moralsk og politisk pondus han var en frihedens fakkel men da han mange r senere vendte tilbage til rusland dalede hans position
935106 de sidste r var han totalt ude af trit med den russiske virkelighed derfor vendte mange ryggen til ham men de vil stadigv k huske solsjenitsyn som en stor forfatter
935107 solsjenitsyn spillede en vigtig rolle n r det gjaldt om at p virke udlandets opfattelse af det kommunistiske styre
935108 da han blev tvunget til at forlade sit f dreland og bosatte sig i usa levede han helt isoleret med sin familie men han forskr kkede tilh rerne og offentligheden da han i en tale p harvard universitet rettede voldsomme angreb p det amerikanske demokrati
935109 det fik mange til at g i bagl s han gik slet ikke ind for et borgerligt demokratisk demokrati men for en diffus slavisk nationalisme med t t tilknytning til den russiskortodokse kirke han var f rst jeltsins mand men lagde senere afstand til ham hvorimod han hyldede putin som manden der var i gang med at genskabe tidligere tiders russiske storhed

935121 i am so happy to be a part of this album representing the struggle of the people for too long we have been tortured prosecuted and oppressed world leaders have their own agenda so are we as a people we are the world the world is ours and we live by the trustworthy principle of ourselves to take us through we are only human we can only stand up for whats right therefore if these words be of offense to you it is just the truth and we express this truth in our songs on a daily basis through the way we live and the cruel and inhumane actions brought upon us peace be to the world the world is ours jah rastafaris love let us all love
935122 the world belongs to the people but it is controlled by the strongest army through organization we can fully exercise our power as a people and as individuals as individuals we have to do what we can to survive and gain positioning that can help the whole as groups we must guard against narrow minded ness and remain open minded and progressive so the movement can avoid stagnation and pettyness as much as possible above all love each other protect each other each one teach one live yo truth keep your integrity and lead by example to be the change you want to see the world is ours

935130 mukhriz may have overplayed his hand he was right to tap into the anti pak lah sentiment but there is also fatigue in the party people want to move on and the general view is that the transition plan helps us to move on and concentrate on fighting the opposition

935138 given there was one action in the tackle and that harvey had possession of the ball for most of the tackle it was deemed a legal tackle and not a reportable offence
935139 it was one we needed to win to give us that break from fourth it was a classic eight point game for us today and weve been building for that
935140 that was surprising how we started but to fight back and to be able to win the game was pleasing
935141 it was like we had stage fright as if its a big game and we didnt want to attack the ball
935142 it was really disappointing obviously we fought our way back by quartertime to be in it at least

935157 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring

935167 a truly balanced energy bill would begin with the serious problem of record gas prices and reducing americas dependence on foreign sources of energy and then proceed with creating incentives that would unleash the power of american inventiveness and creativity in order to develop the next generation of energy technology and supplies h r 6 relies on an outdated and failed belief that washington knows best over 1 000 pages of legislative text contains little in the way of broad based incentives but is chock full of new regulations and a higher tax burden which will do little if anything for consumers a better approach would get washington out of the way and allow market oriented solutions to provide for an affordable diverse and secure energy supply for america

935171 it is more revealing to look further back to the much maligned president carter who in 1979 during the first oil crunch set goals for our country so wed never see a second energy crisis
935172 most of my googling turned up articles reporting on opinion polls which show that a majority of respondents believe that drilling for oil will reduce gas prices in the short term this frankly disgusts me were not lemmings we should get facts and draw our own conclusions not get our coverage of the issue solely based on some vague percentage of support in the polls what a tremendous failure of the media

935234 no acts by bone individually were properly alleged therefore under the above statute n c g s s57c 3 30 b it was improper to name an individual member of a limited liability company as a party defendant without any evidence to support it as such the naming of bone as an individual defendant was not well grounded in law and therefore a violation of rule 11
935235 but the helper the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that i said to you
935236 for since the creation of the world his invisible attributes his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood through what has been made so that they are without excuse for even though they knew god they did not honor him as god or give thanks but they became futile in their speculations and their foolish heart was darkened
935237 craigs claim is that he knows christianity is true by this inner witness which christianity why his version of course what then about different versions of christianity who deny his version is true christianity and vice versa
935238 so is the holy spirit now leading me to see that it is all nonsense or was it just brain chemistry all along
935239 the holy spirit does not lead people to falsehood that is satans work
935240 if you fell away perhaps you never entered into salvation in the first place
935241 shy im better person than you because im a totally broken and hardened person neener neener
935242 surely you dont require uniformity of all christians before you would admit there is a body of true christian doctrine
935243 each christians understanding of the revelation depends on their sanctification age intellect personal study access to the scriptures and quality of their teachers you would scoff if i pointed out atheist disagreements and demand that there is no such thing as true atheism because you guys disagree so much
935244 i have three daughters who are 4 3 and 1 each of them has a relationship with me but they each know different things about me they may have different impressions of me based on their development experience personality etc their knowledge is true but not uniform or precisely true since it is affected by subjective experiences
935245 the same is true for christians some are more capable with the scriptures and get closer to being right than others
935246 and some spend significant amounts of time praying and have a warm close relationship with god but may lack some doctrinal knowledge
935247 then of course there are the false teachers and apostates who put up a good show for a while but their behavior and heresies eventually come out and they are exposed
935248 just because one cannot answer a question perfectly does not mean that there is no content in what cannot be described it simply means we cannot fully describe that reality
935249 yshua himself said that there would be two different perspectives of him one in which we see him as a safe place to become broken before and one where he basically steam rolls over people it seems youre embracing the latter view

935254 everyone deserves the right to health but not everyone is allowed entry into the process of plotting out a countrys health care plan yet countries that include input from marginalized groups are better able to reach those groups with health services we want to show why a country should use human rights in its health planning and then how to go about doing it

935266 gods nature is logical under theism a person can no longer refute arguments based on extreme skepticism the theist can only refute the idea of an invisible magic entity manipulating their mind or being the victim of mental illness if her worldview entails self contained existence
935267 to form a concept one mentally isolates a group of concretes of distinct perceptual units on the basis of observed similarities which distinguish them from all other known concretes similarity is
935268 a concept is a mental integration of two or more units possessing the same distinguishing characteristic s with their particular measurements omitted
935269 mans senses are his only direct cognitive contact with reality and therefore his only source of information without sensory evidence there can be no concepts without concepts there can be no language without language there can be no knowledge and no science
935270 logic is both dependent on god and necessary if logic is dependent on god it must be contingent if logic is contingent then it is not a necessary part of human understanding but logic is a necessary part of human understanding thus logic cannot be dependent on god since there is nothing inconsistent about denying the existence of god but there is in denying the principles of logic
935271 our belief in logic is rooted in the nature of god and evidenced in creation itself

935273 if if it rains then i get wet then if it rains then i get wet
935274 i see no reason to lose any claim to logic
935275 so logic isnt about proving statements true its about proving them true assuming certain premises that are only got by empirical observation
935276 theists often assert that non believers borrow logic from the christian worldview
935277 have absolutely no grounds for discussing the specifics of gods nature
935278 gods nature is logical under theism a person can no longer refute arguments based on extreme skepticism the theist can only refute the idea of an invisible magic entity manipulating their mind or being the victim of mental illness if her worldview entails self contained existence
935279 logic is both dependent on god and necessary if logic is dependent on god it must be contingent if logic is contingent then it is not a necessary part of human understanding but logic is a necessary part of human understanding thus logic cannot be dependent on god since there is nothing inconsistent about denying the existence of god but there is in denying the principles of logic

935283 to exist is to possess identity what identity are they able to give to their superior realm

935285 the tao that can be named is not the true tao
935286 is it possible for something to exist that has never been identified
935287 obviously most of it has yet to be identified in any significant way
935288 perhaps identifying these things requires faculties that human beings dont possess
935289 is our inability to define what is divine evidense of its non existance or an indication of just how limited our vocabulary truly is
935290 the tao that can be named is not the true tao

935301 i just dont understand how a religion that promotes territorialism and human heirarchy can be very freeing do you
935302 ill respond to 3m later but i want to point out that 3m like hinman and many others that comment here get stuck in this
935303 this is a scientific account and it is 100 accurate
935304 this or that culture believed women to have been taken from bone or earth
935305 these cultures had women figurines made from clay or bone
935306 but you saw the opportunity to bail out of the article topic and try to show i was inconsistent because i dont really believe in the caste system
935307 that was an idiotic and evasive response and non answer to my questions
935308 if you havent already will you expound on that please
935309 you brood of vipers how can you who are evil say anything good for out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks
935310 and if your eye causes you to sin pluck it out it is better for you to enter the kingdom of god with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched everyone will be salted with fire
935311 woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you are like whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead mens bones and everything unclean
935312 get these out of here how dare you turn my fathers house into a market
935313 im also curious if the time travelling grace extends to those tribes kingdoms and people who were wiped out violently at gods command by the israelites
935314 i reject you 3m and your insert whatever you please here that would most likely be the most forthright and efficient response
935315 and cole i doubt that god would be so boring as to make another 3m too redundant totally unnecessary

935317 i reject you 3m and your insert whatever you please here that would most likely be the most forthright and efficient response
935318 how are you privy to this information while myself and others are not

935321 i have experienced what the bible describes as being reborn of a free spirit it happened to me and then i found it described in the bible
935322 how ridiculous an answer the question is not how do you know about god it is how does god love us
935323 i had no idea that my conversation here could inspire you into such actions emailing 3 was it 3 you say friends and just when i was beginning to believe i was no influence here at all i was just about to get discouraged and i mean that thank you for the encouragement
935324 for some odd reason i feel it necessary to keep asking her these questions
935325 all these people or populations or populaces had dolls and figurines of women and these were made from bone or earth
935326 for some odd reason i feel it necessary to keep asking her these questions
935327 i dont know why does it matter and what is your point
935328 if people who have a story about women being made from a rib and dont believe it then
935329 if people who made venus figurines dont have a belief in woman being from rib then
935330 does this qualify as a characteristic of other cultural folklore
935331 i dont want to offend anyone and i feel personal rejection when someone disagrees with me
935332 lee your article is pseudoscientific because there is no link between eve being made from rib and the fact that prehistoric humans made tools from rib made figurines of women from rib used the tools from rib to change their environment tried to use the venus figurines to change their environment the purpose of venus figurines was to be used in rituals to influence the environment through sympathetic magic and the venus figurines are smaller versions of larger sculptures of women as evidenced by the asherah and we know that human beings will use technology in stories
935333 my sources were wide and varied and they didnt actually put the belief that woman was made from rib together with the venus figurines there is no smoking gun link
935334 frazers theory is loaded with problems whole papers even books criticizing his theory have been written and nowadays it is extremely difficult to find any recognized reputable anthropologists who will accept it even in a modified form here are some of the major difficulties with it 1 frazers sources were frequently inaccurate or irrelevant or else he interpreted them in tendentious ways 2 frazer himself subscribed to discredited nineteenth century ideas such as the evolutionist model of human societal development which has nothing to do with the theory of biological evolution and is today firmly rejected by experts and the notion that present day primitive tribesmen can be studied as a means of finding out what things were like at the dawn of civilization 3 evidence which has emerged since frazer wrote has not merely failed to back up his hypotheses it has fatally undermined them for interesting critiques of frazers work see e g sir edmund leachs articles in daedalus 90 1961 and current anthropology 7 1966 also in much greater detail j z smith the glory jest and riddle diss yale 1969 by one of the greatest living historians of religion
935335 in genesis there are two versions of the creation of man and woman in the first story the man and woman are created together but in the second story the male is created first with the female made later from his rib
935336 yea though they bring forth yet will i slay even the beloved fruit of their womb
935337 lets see what harvey and the others can come up with for this one
935338 canaanite religion was strongly influenced by their more powerful and populous neighbours and shows clear influence of mesopotamian and egyptian religious practices
935339 when on high heaven was not named and the earth beneath did not yet bear a name and the primeval aps who begat them and chaos tiamat the mother of them both their waters were mingled together and no field was formed no marsh was to be seen when of the gods none had been called into being
935340 higher criticism regards chapters 1 4 of genesis as the re workings of babylonian and canaanite myths concerning creation while the myths stress human servitude to the gods genesis places humankind at the center of the created order over which it exercises dominion as gods agent
935341 genesis is not however a simple re telling of the babylonian myths instead the myths are inverted to serve a theological purpose
935342 things were not nearly as good to begin with as they have become since
935343 who are the nephilim the encyclopedia mythica tells us that they were angels now you can say to me that angels arent gods but its really a distinction without a difference
935344 i am jehovah yahweh the god elohim of abraham the god elohim of isaac
935345 the first account starts out with the creation of heaven and earth 1 1 the present narrative begins with the making of earth and heaven 2 4b
935346 this far reaching divergence in basic philosophy would alone be sufficient to warn the reader that two separate sources appear to be involved one heaven centered and the other earth centered
935347 these are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created in the day that jehovah god made earth and heaven
935348 technique of recapitulation was widely practiced in ancient semitic literature the author would first introduce his account with a short statement summarizing the whole transaction and then he would follow it up with a more detailed and circumstantial account when dealing with matters of special importance
935349 are led by the spirit of god these are sons of god
935350 sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were beautiful and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose
935351 however far be it from me to tell someone who does biblical scholarship for a living how to do their job your arguments have not convinced the majority of experts and i can only appeal to experts in this matter so ill come down on the side of the majority especially since i can see with my own eyes that there are stories that have key elements that predate genesis so while i dont think there is one author in genesis i think it wholly possible there was one editor
935352 in the book of job the phrase is used for angelic or nonhuman beings job 1 6 2 1
935353 1 the phrase could refer to nonhuman beings such as those mentioned in job 1 6 2 1 or 2 the phrase may be an unusual way of referring to human beings
935354 nowhere else in the bible is there even a hint that non human and human beings can mate
935355 there are many parallels in pagan thought but none in biblical thought
935356 i believe to interpret this any other way is inconsistent
935357 joseph son of david do not fear to take mary your wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy spirit
935358 do not be afraid mary for you have found favor with god
935359 the holy spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you therefore the child to be born will be called holy the son of god
935360 when you go forth to war against your enemies and yahweh your god gives them into your hands and you take them captive
935361 be present at sacred gatherings and sacred times to watch over and to join with the saints in their spiritual exercises any serious offense against propriety during these sacred moments will stir up the disapproval of these angelic helpers of the saints perhaps causing them to depart and any good deed they witness will bring all the more aid from them

935363 she would probably imagine that i was mimmicking a line out of some cheap porno flick or some old gangster movie you need to travel more harvey you might be only vaguely aware of it but there is a whole wide world out there beyond the united states i prefer to use the words darling or sweetheart which are far more popular terms of endearment here in australia
935364 job 1 6 now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan also came among them job 2 1 again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan also came among them to present himself before the lord these verses clearly refer to satan as being one of the sons of god to try and assert anything else is nothing less than blatant dishonesty
935365 when you go forth to war against your enemies and yahweh your god gives them into your hands and you take them captive
935366 the term headbanger was coined on led zeppelins first us tour in 1968 during a show at the boston tea party audience members in the first row were banging their heads against the stage in rhythm with the music health issues in 2005 terry balsamo evanescence guitarist received a stroke from headbanging there have also been cases of people receiving whiplash from headbanging and it is not uncommon for some to receive headaches and bloody noses from headbanging

935372 just out of curiosity which books articles online sources other have you read about the culture of the ane and what life was like then
935373 and that is why gold and silver is not going to us 1 000 per ounce despite tremendous belief that they should
935374 we have a huge bond market of us 30 trillion and that represents a debt already created if bond investors believed the fed was going to start to print money and throw it around what would they do they would sell every bond theyve got and that would lead to a decrease in the supply of credit because bond prices would fall and interest rates would rise this is a contraction in the entire supply of credit which is deflation so there arent any alternatives other hard assets such as commodities will also succumb to the deflationary pressure as the recent decline in the commodity index illustrate
935375 you have to ask the question will china allow the west the chance to inflate it debts away as it has always done in the past or will it pull the plug on the dollar and crush us like a fly
935376 on the other hand if dan were to walk into my house and subdue me with blows grab my wife and rape her we would all be universally outraged
935377 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
935378 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
935379 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing
935380 the uk and other economies in europe which had enjoyed housing market booms have also weakened the decline in credit availability is accelerating this process
935381 in the prevailing market conditions this is a resilient performance which enables us to maintain our capital strength continue with our dividend policy and balance the need to conserve capital with our commitment to make it available for investment in our fast growing businesses
935382 constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life

935402 from crisis to opportunity american internationalism and the new atlantic order
935403 the next front is apparent and we should not shirk from acknowledging it
935404 a terrorist resides in baghdad with the resources of an entire state at his disposal flush with cash from illicit oil revenues and proud of a decade long record of defying the international communitys demands that he come clean on his programs to develop weapons of mass destruction
935405 in recent months we have seen a significant increase in home improvement personal loan requests
935406 for the last decade homeowners have been able to sit back and rely on rising property prices to increase the equity in their home but sadly this is no longer possible
935407 if you want to trade up and avoid substantially increasing your mortgage youll need to add value to the house youre currently in
935408 the findings of the survey show intermediaries as realistic but not unduly disheartened
935409 house prices are expected to see a modest correction but in the absence of forced sellers in the market place they do not anticipate a major collapse in property values
935410 these more positive perceptions contrast with the more negative commentary that currently dominates the market and reflects the fact these are locality based views
935411 this exclusive tracker mortgage will be an attractive option for any borrowers with some equity in their home and some funds set aside with which they can offset against the loan
935412 the headline rate is very competitive and we welcome scottish widows bank to our mortgage club for the first time
935413 we are delighted to be joining the legal amp general mortgage club and are very pleased to introduce this attractive tracker mortgage exclusive to members
935414 we were in discussions with money partners when they made their decision to restrict their distribution channels but we were confident we had the infrastructure to deliver what they were looking for in a packager partner
935415 the original decision to limit direct access to our products was based on the funding constraints currently felt by most lenders in the market and came after careful analysis of our packager panel at the time however since we made this decision we have continued in highly constructive talks with the orbiter group and have been deeply impressed with their commitment and long term strategy appointing tfc homeloans to our packager panel is one element of a much bigger relationship with the group which we look forward to developing over the coming months
935416 congratulations to andy and lets hope for him and the rest of england that it is a great night of football and that the result will mark the occasion accordingly the results thrown up by the survey have made very interesting reading and on behalf of tma i would like to thank all those who took the time to take part we greatly value intermediary feedback and where appropriate integrate this feedback into our offering so that brokers really are receiving added value
935417 id like to extend my thanks to all those at tma im used to getting great service and added benefits from being a member of tma but to receive this added extra is a fantastic bonus and im really looking forward to the trip to wembley
935418 congratulations to andy on winning the competition and we look forward to welcoming him to wembley for what is sure to be a super night the survey results confirmed our belief that there has never been a better time to sell mortgage payment protection products at a time of record levels of personal indebtedness and uncertainty over the general economy the benefits of mppi should be obvious to all

935423 whatever your beliefs you should read dineshs book it is the best defense of christianity that has ever been published
935424 craig is a better speaker so he only looked like the winner
935425 dsouza is exactly right in this case if you guys are the champions of reason that you claim to be then you should own every debate oral or written such is not the case
935426 think not that i am come to make peace on earth i came not to send peace but the sword and to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law
935427 and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more
935428 before the coming of the true messiah the prophet elijah shall appear and turn the heart of the fathers to their children and the heart of the children to their fathers
935429 yea all kings shall prostrate themselves before him all nations shall serve him
935430 his dominion shall be from sea even to sea and from the river even to the end of the earth
935431 and it shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the lords house shall be established on the top of the mountains
935432 and he shall judge among the nations and arbitrate among many people and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruninghooks
935433 after many days thou shalt be visited in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword
935434 afterward shall the children of israel return and seek the lord their god and david their king and shall revere the lord and his goodness in the latter days
935435 and god maketh known to the king nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days
935436 and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the sovereignty shall not be left to other people
935437 and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever
935438 awake awake put on thy strength o zion put on thy beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean
935439 who sanctify themselves and purify themselves we prefer the literal translation of this obscure passage to the unwarranted and still more obscure translation of the authorised version in the gardens behind one in the midst of them who eat the flesh of the swine and the abomination and the mouse shall be consumed together saith the lord
935440 and verse 23 it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come and worship before me saith the lord
935441 and it shall come to pass that every one that is left of all the nations which came against jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king the lord of hosts and to keep the feast of tabernacles
935442 thus saith the lord of hosts in those days it shall come to pass that ten men of nations of diverse languages shall take hold even shall take hold of the skirt of a jew authorised version renders it
935443 and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that i will cut off the names of the idols from the earth and they shall no more be remembered also i will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit literally the spirit of uncleanliness to pass away from the earth
935444 the lord will be terrible unto them for he will cause all the gods of the earth to waste away and men shall worship him every one from his place even all the isles of the heathen
935445 and the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed to love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest live
935446 the remnant of israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth
935447 at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of the lord and all the nations shall be gathered unto it to the name of the lord to jerusalem neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart
935448 and i will sprinkle clean water upon you from all your impurity and from all your idols will i cleanse you and i will give unto you a new heart and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them
935449 neither shall they defile themselves any more with the idols nor with their abominations nor with their transgressions and i will save them out of all their dwelling places wherein they have sinned and i will cleanse them and they shall be my people and i will be their god and david my servant shall be king over them and they shall have one shepherd and they shall walk in my judgments and observe my statutes and do them
935450 and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more
935451 and they that dwell in the cities of israel shall go forth and shall set on fire and burn the weapons both the shields and the bucklers the bows and the arrows and the handstaves and the spears and they shall burn them with fire seven years ibid verse 10 so that they shall take no wood out of the field neither cut down any out of the forests for with the weapons shall they kindle the fire
935452 and i will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth and i will make them to lie down safely
935453 and the battlebow shall be cut off and he shall speak peace unto the heathen
935454 the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them
935455 and the cow and the bear shall feed together their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox
935456 and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrices den
935457 they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord
935458 and the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpents meat they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the lord
935459 and i will make with them a covenant of peace and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods
935460 and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen neither shall the beast of the land devour them
935461 and in that day will i make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven and with the creeping things of the ground
935462 he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the god of truth and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are hid from mine eyes
935463 and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall no more be heard in her nor the voice of crying
935464 there shall be no more thence an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die a hundred years old but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed
935465 and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them
935466 they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands
935467 moreover i will make a covenant of peace with them it shall be an everlasting covenant with them and i will establish and multiply them and set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore
935468 my residence also shall be among them yea i will be their god and they shall be my people
935469 and the heathen shall know that i the lord do sanctify israel when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore
935470 neither will i hide my face any more from them for i have poured out my spirit upon the house of israel saith the lord god
935471 and he said unto me son of man the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet where i will dwell in the midst of the children of israel for ever
935472 and the name of the city from that day shall be the lord is there
935473 and ye shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and there is none else and my people shall never be ashamed
935474 and it shall come to pass afterwards that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions
935475 so ye shall know that i am the lord your god dwelling in zion my holy mountain then shall jerusalem be holy and there shall no strangers pass through it any more
935476 for i will avenge their blood that i had not avenged for the lord dwelleth in zion
935477 sing and rejoice o daughter of zion for lo i come and dwell in the midst of thee saith the lord
935478 for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea
935479 and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall know me from the lowest of them to the highest saith the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and remember their sin no more
935480 argues that christianity has been good for western society that it is growing in numbers in todays world that it produced modern science ended things like slavery and was the foundation of limited government he argues that atheism has been bad for society and that the christian past isnt as bad as the atheist past
935481 thus i fully expect in maybe a hundred years they will take full credit for ending the persecution of gay people but the truth as we know is that they are being dragged kicking and screaming toward acceptance of gays by the more secular part of society
935482 the point is that if atheists were the champions of reason that they seem to proclaim so much that theists would not win any debates
935483 the theist won on prose but the atheist won on content
935484 god has properties a b and c and has performed historical acts x y and z
935485 show me the evidence otherwise theres no way you can know that
935486 our triune christian god is the one and only true god and is the creator of the universe who takes an interest in me loves me accepts me will reward me with the blissful pleasures of heaven after my death all my beliefs extracted from scripture will always be the best statement of truth forever and anyone who disagrees with me will be tortured in the flames of hell for an eternity
935487 the study reveals how stress makes people more susceptible to illness
935488 if you shoot someone in the head it kills them
935489 it comes from somewhere else like from god but i dont know how
935490 while there are certainly mistakes which are made and pockets of violent christians the message of christ was and is overwhelmingly that of grace and peace the label doesnt matter as much as the belief and the behavior which is borne of it
935491 if catholics had half the testosterone of muzzies the answer would be simple holy hollowpoint
935492 hey mr critical i dare you to do something to desecrate islam oh thats right they are not passive like christians and a loud mouth jerk like yourself would get jihaded
935493 if any professor denigrated and insulted homosexuals muslims threatened to desecrate the koran or insulted martin luther king in this way you would have an all out riot on your hands however as usual it seems to be open season on catholics with no consequences
935494 if you have such apparent regard for the sincere faith of others i challenge you to publish a similar disparaging remark about the koran or other sacred beliefs of islam
935495 would you be so brave as to use such hate filled rhetoric against the muslim tenets i doubt youd want a jihad launched against you
935496 i seriously doubt that he would ask someone to get him a koran from a mosque asking for the koran would probably bring him and the u of m physical harm
935497 you would not choose a muslim symbol to desecrate because you would be in grave danger you pick a catholic symbol because you know that catholics will just pray for you
935498 you just dont have the backbone to attack the muslims do you coward
935499 if youre looking for something to desecrate why dont you try a quran
935500 since you mentioned fatwa i bet you dont have the balls to descreat a koran go ahead i dare you
935501 if you have balls go after the muslim or i forgot you scare
935502 now just go pick on the muslims or are you too afraid you must be you assinine phd too afraid to affront a religious belief that would terminate you
935503 do you have the guts to do something similar regarding the muslim religion i doubt you do you know they would lop your head off
935504 do you want to demonstrate real courage by desecrating a religious symbol
935505 christian extremists have joined muslim extremists in threatening free speech do those christians who bleated loudest at the muslim outrages over the danish cartoons now retreat in quiet humility and introspection to determine what went wrong in their religious community or do they bleat louder that this is somehow different or do they ignore it and hope it goes away my money is on option c
935506 i dont personally know any christians who think or say
935507 lets just look at a few excerpts from hate mail received by pz myers over the cracker kerfluffle and see if this notion of
935508 since you mentioned fatwa i bet you dont have the balls to descreat a koran go ahead i dare you
935509 do you want to demonstrate real courage by desecrating a religious symbol
935510 well sir you dont get to blaspheme and walk away from this you have two choices my fucked up friend first you can quit your job for the good of the children or you can get your brains beat in i give you till the first of the month get that resignation in cunt
935511 you are really fucked now lock your doors at night and check under your car before you turn the ignition key
935512 come on down to florida we know how to welcome bastards like you with a bullet
935513 thank you for your comment regarding the desecration of the eucharist i am sure jesus has heard it and will respond accordingly it may hurt a little but dont worry
935514 bad kind who must suffer based not on virtues or ethics but on gods
935515 taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man who takes refuge in him
935516 this is the best water ive ever tasted come and have some with me
935517 i will blot out from the earth the human beings i have created people together with animals and creeping things and birds of the air
935518 for the lord your god had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands as he has now done
935519 for it was of the lord to harden their hearts that they should come against israel in battle that he might destroy them utterly
935520 totally destroy everything that belongs to them do not spare them put to death men and women children and infants cattle and sheep camels and donkeys
935521 he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks
935522 will strike down the young men and will have no mercy on infants nor will they look with compassion on children whoever is captured will be thrust through all who are caught will fall by the sword their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes their houses will be looted and their wives ravished
935523 beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears
935524 instead of addressing these immoral acts you ask by what standard is all of this stuff evil
935525 and yet you have not given us a standard by which we can judge anything as actually being evil
935526 you claim that certain things on earth move without offering a universal standard of motion by what basis do you judge anything on earth moves because of your opinion
935527 how blessed is he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks
935528 in order to enjoy this fountain you must enjoy the blood of innocents
935529 this participant was better off at the end of the action
935530 if your moral framework tells you that it is okay to set people up as pawns so that they can be destroyed then i can admit that according to your moral framework those actions are objectively good
935531 since my framework says that you being an atheist are supressing the truth and blinding yourself to the obvious it is therefore an objective truth that you are indeed that way because it is objectively true in my given framework
935532 but the earth is rotating and revolving and it is in a pinwheel galaxy that is moving
935533 since my framework says that you being an atheist are supressing the truth and blinding yourself to the obvious it is therefore an objective truth that you are indeed that way because it is objectively true in my given framework
935534 i do not have to passively accept the moral definitions of another but i do have to realize that there will sometimes be consequences
935535 if he or she wants to judge us based on rules he puts in place he can do so
935536 but what you miss every time is that in every moral framework that condemns these acts your god is not good the only way to call your god good is to adopt a moral framework in which everything that we have conventionally thought of as evil is actually good when applied to your god
935537 we see teaching that a god comes in human flesh and instead of casting out demons into the abyss instead puts them into innocent animals who subsequently jump off of a cliff matthew 8
935538 selection alone is not capable of creating a new species because each animal and each plant already has a limited number of genes and dna a mouse has vastly different dna than a horse and this is the reason that no one will ever be able to breed a mouse into a horse the dna itself must be changed it does not matter how many individual traits you select for a breed there is a limit to every breeding species
935539 science is a philosophy just as much as religion is
935540 the ku klux klan is getting bigger arent you glad you are not a nigger
935541 what is morality or ethics it is a code of values to guide mans choices and actions the choices and actions that determine the purpose and the course of his life ethics as a science deals with discovering and defining such a code
935542 man has been called a rational being but rationality is a matter of choice and the alternative his nature offers him is rational being or suicidal animal man has to be man by choice he has to hold his life as a value by choice he has to learn to sustain it by choice he has to discover the values it requires and practice his virtues by choice a code of values accepted by choice is a code of morality
935543 i dont think there is anything wrong with blacks i think every white man should own one
935544 the consequences of the decision to separate from other baptists in defense of white supremacy and the institution of slavery have been long lived a survey by sbcs home mission board in 1968 showed that only eleven percent of southern baptist churches would admit americans of african descent
935545 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so that as many as believe in him may not perish but have eternal life
935546 i see heaven open and the son of man standing at the right hand of god
935547 recognizes and exploits an existing need or demand of a potential follower and looks for potential motives in followers seeks to satisfy higher needs and engages the full person of the follower
935548 but tends to go further seeking to arouse and satisfy higher needs to engage the full person of the follower to a higher level of need according to maslows hierarchy of needs
935549 ich will hier zusammen mit meinen mannschaftskameraden und den fans dazu beitragen dass aek seine ziele erreichen wird
935550 i shot an arrow into the air it fell to earth i knew not where
935551 and hes got accreditation hell he aint even got any shoes
935552 presuming god exists would things work the same way with out god
935553 god wants all living things to die if without water air or food
935554 all these people or populations or populaces had dolls and figurines of women and these were made from bone or earth
935555 god wants all living things to die if without water air or food
935556 god intended mammals to die without air water or food
935557 makes god a monster that wants people to die of scurvy
935558 you said that our common ancestors lived in an environment that had plenty of vitamin c therefore they logically lost their ability to make it because there was no need for it
935559 you can believe many different things but to believe god exists and he created adam and eve and all their descendants lovingly you also have to believe he created them in a way that would make them horribly sick if they went without ascorbic acid for a period of time to me this makes him seem a monster
935560 let the world of knowledge be laid to waste i will believe my bible first
935561 for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again
935562 if you havent read these then you are not qualified to speak
935563 but it really is silly for me to claim that im an ia dialogue game isnt it when it is certainly more plausible that i am a human
935564 i dont know that it wasnt the devil so it at least could have been the devil
935565 youre in the matrix i cant prove it but trust me its true
935566 from the garden i have given ye shall ye never depart nay for if thou eatest not of fruits high in vitamin c verily shalt thou die
935567 why is the cell structure of different organisms so fundamentally different
935568 i cant believe this evolved therefore it must be irreducibly complex
935569 but i understand what i read what i read points to irreducible complexity on some levels
935570 eyes corresponding to every stage in this sequence have been found in existing living species the existence of this range of less complex light sensitive structures supports scientists hypotheses about how complex eyes like ours could evolve
935571 i am not arguing for a young earth although none of us can unequivocally prove it is not
935572 a geometric distance to the galaxy ngc4258 from orbital motions in a nuclear gas disk
935573 this whole article talks of natural selection as if it is intelligent it isnt random processes are random if one animal had a light sensitive spot on its skin that gave it some advantage the chances of passing the genetic material on to one of its offspring depending on which animal it may have been and how many offsrping it could produce per generation would be very slim because it was a mutation of course mutations can be passed on and they are all the time but life is engineered in such a way as to keep mutations from happening each one of us has an immune system that is on guard 100 of the time but hampered by stress and other factors we can potentially and plausibly have cancer cells develping right now that our immune system is killing off and well never know we have a mutation underway unless our immune system cant win
935574 there is no question in my mind that there is an intelligent designer we all know a well put together machine when we see one and we dont question that it was indeed put together
935575 the world is too complex to have arisen on its own then it must have been designed
935576 x is too complex to have arisen on its own then it must have been designed
935577 contains the earliest and most authenticated testimony of the resurrection itself
935578 the germans create it the british correct it and the americans corrupt it
935579 his whole jewish education would have revolved around that kind of thinking i certainly wouldnt be suprised if he relied on it in his writing especially to a jewish audience
935580 a writer who thus relates his story to the wider context of world history is courting trouble if he is not careful he affords his critical readers so many opportunities to assess his accuracy one of the most remarkable tokens of his accuracy is his sure familiarity with the proper titles of all the notable persons whoa re mentioned in his pages this was by no means such an easy feat in his days as it is in ours when it is so simple to consult convenient books of reference
935581 but given the massively accurately terminology luke uses to describe each and every governmental leader he notes a second century person would clearly not have that information from reading josephus or anything else his familiarity with the local terminology and customs and names can only come from someone who was actually there in the first century there is no reason whatsoever to assign a second century date to luke acts
935582 support for the conclusion that acts was written prior to the destruction of jerusalem in 70 ad
935583 1 after devoting over half of acts to pauls ministry acts 28 leaves paul alive and under house arrest waiting for caesar talk about a cliffhanger
935584 introduce shadows of martyrdom as they fall not too darkly across his heros path
935585 indicate that paul was aware of what was to happen
935586 2 acts portrays the roman government as benevolent towards christianity an attitude that definitely changed in 64 ad when emperor nero blamed the christians
935587 brethren i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee
935588 the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit
935589 that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead
935590 and now faith hope and love abide these three and the greatest of these is love
935591 we do not know how to pray as we should
935592 the signs of a true apostle were performed among you by signs and wonders and miracles
935593 one is informed by acts that st pauls early day stance was as
935594 luke almost certainly knew and drew upon the works of josephus or else an amazing series of coincidences remains in want of an explanation and therefore luke and acts were written at the end of the 1st century or perhaps the beginning of the 2nd
935595 christianity asserts what we all perceive as existence is simply the imagination of its
935596 by far the majority of publications on the subject of jesus death and resurrection have been written by north american authors interestingly my study of these works also indicates an approximate ratio of 3 1 of moderate conservative to skeptical publications as with the european publications
935597 habermas data was based largely on non christian nt scholars
935598 christianity asserts what we all perceive as existence is simply the imagination of its
935599 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
935600 so let me get this straight since we dont know the exact whereabouts of saul during jesus ministry we can conclude
935601 perhaps you could provide the source for your assertion that
935602 the sort of thoroughgoing propaganda literature that some critics believe the gospels to be was actually nonexistent in ancient times
935603 there will be a telephone call today between jalili and solana
935604 negotiations are an ongoing process and the question of a deadline is media speculation
935605 if its in 16 days instead of 14 its not a problem we are not obsessed with a date
935606 in this discussion the two sides will be looking for common points for future cooperation
935607 negative consequences await if they dont have a positive response to our very generous incentives package and that would possibly come in the form of sanctions
935608 we will take part in any negotiations and talk about any issue which consolidates our nuclear rights
935609 the conversation took place and solana will report on it to the representatives of the group of six

935616 ich denke nicht dass der moralische aspekt eine rolle spielen wird es war nur ein testspiel und ich glaube unsere moral wird kein problem sein das eigentliche problem ist es wieder auf h herem niveau zu spielen um auf bessere art und weise konkurrieren zu k nnen es ist nun mal fakt dass wir nicht auf dem gleichen level spielen wie zu beginn der letzten saison

935629 dan di antara orang orang munafik itu ada orang orang yang mendirikan masjid untuk menimbulkan kemudharatan pada orang orang mukmin untuk kekafiran dan untuk memecah belah antara orang orang mukmin serta menunggu kedatangan orang orang yang telah memerangi allah dan rasul nya sejak dahulu 660
935630 sahabat abi hurairah ra berkata bahwa nabi saw telah bersabda
935631 mengapa di waktu kamu mendengar berita bohon itu orang orang mukminin dan mukminat tidak bersangka baik terhadap diri mereka sendiri dan mengapa tidak berkata
935632 hai orang orang yang beriman jika datang kepadamu orang fasik membawa suatu berita maka periksalah dengan teliti agar kamu tidak menimpakan suatu musibah kepada suatu kaum tanpa mengetahui keadaannya yang menyebabkan kamu menyesal atas perbuatanmu itu qs al hujuraat 6
935633 sesungguhnya orang orang yang ingin agar berita perbuatan yang amat keji itu tersiar di kalangan orang orang yang beriman bagi mereka azab yang pedih di dunia dan di akhirat
935634 orang orang munafik itu yaitu orang orang yang mencela orang orang mukmin yang memberi sedekah dengan sukarela dan mencela orang orang yang tidak memperoleh untuk disedekahkan selain sekedar kesanggupannya maka orang orang munafik itu menghina mereka
935635 sahabat numan bin basyir ra berkata bahwa rasulullah saw telah bersabda
935636 ada empat sifat yang apabila dimiliki oleh seseorang maka dia berarti munafik murni dan barangsiapa memiliki salah satu dari empat sifat dimaksud berarti dia memiliki salah satu dari ciri seorang munafik empat sifat itu adalah apabila berbicara bohong apabila dipercaya serong apabila berjanji mengingkari dan apabila berdebat tidak sportif lacur
935637 hai orang orang yang beriman hendaklah kamu jadi orang orang yang selalu menegakkan kebenaran karena allah menjadi saksi dengan adil
935638 sahabat ibnu masud ra berkata bahwa rasulullah saw telah bersabda
935639 jauhilah olehmu berprasangka sebab berprasangka adalah sejelek jelek pembicaraan janganlah kamu saling mencari kejelekan orang lain janganlah saling bermegah megahan dan janganlah saling dengki mendengki janganlah saling mengumbar emosi dan janganlah saling menjauhi jadilah kamu hamba hamba allah yang bersatu dan bersaudara sebagaimana yang telah diperintahkan allah kepadamu seorang muslim dengan muslim lainnya adalah bersaudara yang di antara mereka dilarang saling menganiaya saling menghina dan saling naeremehkan taqwa adalah di sini sambil rasulullah memberi isyarah ke arah dada cukuplah seorang muslim dikatakan melakukan kejelekan apabila dia menghina sesama muslim seorang muslim dengan muslim lainnya harus saling menjaga darah kehormatan dan harta kekayaannya
935640 sahabat abi hurairah ra berkata bahwa rasulullah saw telah bersabda
935641 menghina terhadap sesama muslim termasuk perbuatan dosa setiap muslim dengan muslim lain adalah haram dirampas darahnya kehormatannya dan harta bendanya

935651 it was refreshing to see your article on the religious relativism of abdul kareem surash in which this iranian theologian is quoted as saying that all religious understanding is relative and that no one interpretation is absolute such a lesson in religious tolerance and pluralism is not just needed in iran in the united states people like pat robertson pat buchanan and jerry falwell need to comprehend that they do not possess a monopoly in understanding gods will additionally of course it would be a great day for the world if the pope would also adopt surashs admonition to abandon religious absolutism

935665 the sns accepts the prime ministers proposal and his reasons for the environment ministers dismissal
935666 minister iz k had the power to decide about how certain issues were treated at the ministry
935667 several factors indicate that he used this power to support either his personal interests or the interests of his party be it through the distribution of subsidies to municipalities that are led by members the slovak national party or by supporting people who were close to the ministers personal or party environment
935668 we have defined an inclination to party cronyism also at the finance ministry and the prime minister for example has not addressed the problem there
935669 so yes fico made the right decision in case of iz k but on the other hand we see that there are double standards applied and that not all ministers are similarly punished
935670 iz k was the worst environment minister in the countrys post revolutionary history
935671 the conduct of the environment ministry has never been as harmful to nature and the environment as it was during the iz k era
935672 under his management there was personnel cleansing at the ministries and in management of the national parks
935673 slovakia is facing infringement proceedings by the european commission over the removal of fallen wood from the tich and k prov dolina valleys in the high tatras
935674 the prime minister had many reasons to recall iz k before the environmental fund scandal
935675 he approved almost sk1 million for an stv promotional programme that one sidedly defended the fight against the bark beetle in national parks
935676 he seemed to me more a mistake of the system than a real minister
935677 the environment ministry does not stand for protection of nature or preserving its values but has been walking a path where economic aspects seem to be more dominant
935678 people have their jobs and pay taxes and they should expect the state to perform the role of protecting the environment which is in fact a sort of patriotism
935679 civil organisations and the public can do quite a lot in this area but they cannot replace the state in this role
935680 the ruling parties do not currently have qualified professionals to fill this post
935681 the distribution of subsidies worth hundreds of thousands crowns for solar panels are not the greatest problem of the environment ministry under iz k

935715 modern cost effective reliable and affordable infrastructure services are critical for sustainable development
935716 our client countries are asking us to do more to help bring these services to the almost 900 million people without access to safe water the 1 6 billion people without electricity the 2 5 billion people without sanitation services and the estimated one billion people without easy access to an all weather road the action plan is a roadmap to guide our scaled up investments in infrastructure in a way that also supports environmental sustainability and social inclusion
935717 ifc finances private sector projects which play a major role in satisfying the huge infrastructure needs in developing countries we expect our investments to double over the next three years from levels during the previous three years
935718 in carrying out the action plan ifc puts a special emphasis on public private partnerships in building such things as power plants and water and transportation systems as the basis for economic growth and poverty reduction
935719 as part of the world bank group miga helps mitigate the risks that typically affect infrastructure investments such as contract breaches when dealing with untested local governments

935747 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available we should ask those who make profits out of revelling in or encouraging selfish irresponsibility among young men what they think theyre doing

935755 the main reason for young educated people to work abroad is to earn some money that can be used for housing when they come back home
935756 after returning they try to find a job that fits their qualifications
935757 they want to work in a german speaking country because they have learned german at school and want to see the world
935758 the rules are set up so that foreigners can only get a work permit if there is no one adequate for the job among the local population
935759 from my experience i can say that many slovaks are very quickly disappointed by these jobs because the work is hard and the compensation is unsatisfactory
935760 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything
935761 and afterwards perhaps thanks to the good experiences on both sides we couldnt resist partnering with a town in switzerland even though there were no historical connections between h nenberg and us
935762 we are very happy to say that the partnership is gradually moving to more than just an official level
935763 the donation to restore the calvary complex is significant and great because it supports something that we really care about and that extends beyond regional and national interests
935764 so we have organised the owners and volunteers and are trying to continue the work that was stopped in 1951
935765 but the real way to save the complex is to bring life back to it otherwise it will be neglected again and we will have to restore it in another 50 years

935769 slovakia has a big advantage because it used to be a trilingual society that provided an excellent foundation for prosperity in the region
935770 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything
935771 swiss experience in constructing tunnels has been used several times in slovakia
935772 recently a project to build a hospital waste incineration plant in slovakia was completed as part of a swiss development assistance project
935773 switzerland has the highest share of electricity produced by hydro electric plants in europe 60 percent which means it has a lot of experience in this area which we can use
935774 the swiss financial mechanism will be an important development impulse for economic cooperation
935775 however swiss companies have also already experienced some problems with the lack of qualified workers in slovakia
935776 thanks to the changed business climate they are considering coming back to slovakia or to making or enhancing acquisitions in slovakia
935777 the introduction of the euro is considered to be an important stimulus for swiss slovak cooperation in the forthcoming period
935778 on the other hand slovak firms do business in switzerland on an incomparably smaller scale
935779 you can for example eat in a slovak restaurant near bern or in zurich you can let a slovak travel agency organise your holiday provide services on the internet market or in it

935786 applying the experience of existing euro area member countries to the case of slovakia the cash changeover is estimated to increase aggregate consumer prices by 0 32 percent between july 2008 and july 2009
935787 slovakias view corresponds with the results of the oecd study and confirms the thesis that the euro does not directly equal price increases
935788 the study has shown unambiguously that slovakia cannot expect an enormous increase in prices due to the euro switch
935789 the young ones will be confronted with an increase of about sk710 in annual additional consumption expenditures per household because of the euros introduction while for the older generation it will be about sk163 annually per household
935790 if it turns out that the euro changeover has a severe impact on some groups of citizens the government will take immediate action
935791 our message for slovakia is do not stop economic reforms
935792 we have seen in other countries that after the adoption of the euro there is often a certain reform fatigue
935793 although the overall actual price effect of the cash changeover was very small in most euro area countries inflation perceptions increased notably after the changeover as there was a widespread feeling among the public that the euro had brought about significant price hikes
935794 i will not speak to journalists any more theyve distorted everything

935797 the sharp fall in petrol prices represents great news for motorists but there should have been more to cheer about by now
935798 over the last three weeks the national average petrol price has fallen by almost 10 cents a litre yet declines in world prices suggest that pump prices should have fallen by double that amount
935799 the national average price is likely to moderate to 1 40 a litre in the next fortnight

935840 ich freue mich riesig und bin gl cklich dass ich in peking nun spielen darf
935841 ich lauf mal um die ecke und schau obs noch andere hotels gibt
935842 ja wenn uns jetzt hier der sprit ausgeht wirds wirklich spannend
935843 magazine schauen vom prinzip her seit 150 jahren gleich aus der mangel an innovation in diesem bereich hat mich frustriert
935844 auswirkungen auf millionen menschen und wir d rfen nicht zulassen dass das passiert
935845 nirgends in sicht jeden tag gibt es fast drei mal mehr menschen die sich neu infizieren als menschen die eine therapie mit antiretroviralen medikamenten beginnen
935846 wir wagen nicht unsere wachsamkeit aufzugeben das ist eine unvers hnliche epidemie
935847 ich m chte s ngerin werden aber diese tr ume k nnen nur wahr werden wenn wir medikamente haben wenn wir in schulen aufgenommen werden und wenn wir in einer atmosph re aufwachsen k nnen die frei ist von gewalt stigmata und diskriminierungen
935848 god bless you two we need more youngsters such as yourself
935849 yes thank you for finding my dog he chewed through his leash and dug a way under the fence thank you so much let me give you somethin
935850 please dont give us anything for it we just wanted to find his owner and we did thank you anyways
935851 are you sure i would be able to give you
935852 nope we require no payment for that its perfectly fine were just happy that we were able to find you before someone else found your dog
935853 the build we played was only 70 complete but the split screen was slick fluid and fast
935854 kp would relish the chance to be england captain and as good a player as he already is now the extra responsibility might just send him on to a higher plane
935855 he is an exciting cricketer who has a decent cricket brain to go with his talents with the bat and although he will be different to michael there is every chance that he could be a success
935856 there are times when pietersen plays like an individual as when he got out on 94 at edgbaston
935857 then compare that with the way graeme smith played a captains innings to win the game for south africa
935858 felipe drove possibly the best race of his career and we are very disappointed at what happened to him just a handful of kilometres from the end
935859 we now have to react to this negative moment in our usual way with grit determination and with everyone playing their part
935860 we have three weeks of hard work ahead of us to be as prepared as possible for the european grand prix
935861 as you saw everything was perfect then you know what happened and it did so without warning without the slightest indication
935862 unfortunately racing can be a cruel sport but these things can happen
935863 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ
935864 you have not spoken of emptiness we have not heard emptiness
935865 showing you the way but not doing the job for you
935866 the final third is a little bit of a problem we have only threatened from long range free kicks and follow ups
935867 we lacked punch we had that problem in the first 10 or 12 games last season you address it by working on drills in training and building confidence
935868 but we are getting the six or seven new players drilled into what playing for this club is all about
935869 i saw fulham at birmingham and they are blending together as a team
935870 they are probably in their pre season a little bit ahead of us they look to have a bit more of a cutting edge
935871 kris is a player with huge amounts of talent and natural skill
935872 i couldnt figure out more now i have to look at my communication brief what is required if i got one
935873 he wanted to die in the summer and he died in the summer
935874 he wanted to die at home and he died at home in general i should say that alexander isaevich lived a difficult but happy life
935875 solzhenitsyns fate as well as the fate of millions of the countrys citizens was befallen by severe trials
935876 he was one of the first who spoke aloud about the inhuman stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
935877 will remain for us an example of genuine devotion and selfless serving to the people fatherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humanism
935878 kalian ini baru sehari guru ini mengajar kalian sudah seenaknya saja
935879 he hamilton is a champion hes already proven that the country and the formula one world should expect great things from him
935880 mclaren constantly favored the hamilton he isnt a good driver alonso showed the mclaren team what to do with their car and made it into the best machine in formula one
935881 merde il y a encore un ou une qui se fout en lair fait chier le temps qui nettoie tout on en as pour des plombes encore
935882 we think its really important that these things can scale between in game and out of game and how we can use them on the web
935883 a category of games to use avatars in different ways
935884 the final guide we have this year is to think of them in an e10 context that doesnt mean it wont change but this fall they wont be able to blow each others heads off
935885 the answer is a mixed one from a user profile perspective you have one avatar for one profile you can change you avatar whenever you want but if you want a new avatar you need a new profile

935991 ik was erg bang de windhoos zag eruit als een enorme slurf die in een soort trechter naar beneden loopt ik moest meteen aan tornados in films denken ik kon niet geloven dat het waar was de dakgoot van de buren vloog door de lucht
935992 er vloog van alles rond in die slurf hout takken je kunt het zo gek niet bedenken ik zag zelfs een schaap vliegen en dacht dit kan helemaal niet heel vreemd een stuk dak boven mijn slaapkamer is weggeslagen het is daar n grote rommel alle spullen zijn door elkaar gehusseld

935999 the guy came in and shouted give me all the money but i called his bluff and said no way i wasnt going to give it up without a fight no matter how big the knife was
936000 i then spotted a metal bar under the counter and grabbed it when the robber lunged at me with the knife i whacked him over the head with the bar
936001 looking back on it im not sure if it was a brave or a stupid thing to do but it certainly did the trick
936002 we cant believe this has happened on ikkys very first day we have never had problems like this before
936003 the family are all so proud of him it takes a certain type of person to do what he did there wasnt much cash in the shop at the time and we are really thankful ikky is unharmed
936004 i love coming to scotland and this wont put me off most people are really friendly towards me and this type of thing can happen anywhere
936005 we can confirm an attempted robbery took place at a shop in pumpherston west lothian at around 9 30pm on thursday evening

936008 the fringe has gone corporate i think its these celebrities who come in and do one show and soak up three thousand or six thousand tickets and then leave again they hurt the smaller performers who play the fringe

936010 edinburgh is a special place for me i didnt want to come back unless i had a show that could top all the others

936021 een dochter woont in alblasserdam en mn zoon in goudswaard die zegt ik zou nooit meer terug willen naar de stad
936022 er is natuurlijk veel meer toestroom gekomen van buitenlanders het straatbeeld is rommeliger geworden zakjes propjes je ziet ze overal
936023 ik ben nogal precies het stoort me dat ook de winkels aan het verpauperen zijn geen kwaad woord van buitenlanders hoor maar al die kistjes en dozen voor de winkelpui zijn geen gezicht vroeger had je een strakke lijn daarnaast vind ik dat al die buitenlandse groenten er niet echt appetijtelijk uitzien
936024 en heel veel kleine moslimpjes die worden natuurlijk wel groter
936025 er zijn w l heel veel rustige mensen bij mijn vrouw is vaak genoeg nageroepen als ze met een hoed op naar de kerk liep maar nog nooit door een moslim
936026 maar onze kerkelijke gemeente de gereformeerde gemeente van rotterdam centrum doet wel mee aan een evangelisatieproject in zuid een van onze dochters doet daar erg veel vrijwilligerswerk voor
936027 neem nu het maaltijdproject dat ze hebben vijf gangen voor 2 euro je kunt je voorstellen dat het iedere vrijdag vol zit dan vraag je je af waar komen ze nou voor voor het eten of voor het woord natuurlijk weet je nooit wat de heere ermee doet maar ik zeg wel eens tegen mijn dochter om in onze leer te komen zoals we dat van huis uit meegekregen hebben dat gaat niet een twee drie het komt aan op de wedergeboorte

936029 toen zaten er op zondag een kleine 2000 mensen in de kerk
936030 als je naar de kerk liep zag je hele drommen naar de boezemsingel lopen hoe dat nu is misschien zijn er s zondags nog 100 120 mensen dan heb je het wel gehad en de gemeente in west waar we na ons huwelijk heengingen is tien jaar geleden al dichtgegaan

936032 baobao zag er erg verouderd uit toen hij het aardbevingsgebied bezocht het breekt mijn hart

936040 de kosten voor de consument gaan naar verwachting nog verder omhoog

936068 a man who has not been to italy is always conscious of an inferiority from his not having seen what a man is supposed to see
936069 approximately 40 per cent of the private buyers at the top are in the fashion world in some manner
936070 in the 1960s collectors came from the world of cinema but now in italy theres been a shift to fashion
936071 at our first modern italian art sale in 2000 55 per cent of the work went back to italy
936072 much of 20th century italian art is undervalued and a relative bargain compared with american modern masters
936073 five years ago this picture would have gone for tops 200 000 about dh1 49 million
936074 because of the jump in value for fontana and other artists were seeing more clients from the financial world demanding italian paintings
936075 i think the italians are born into creativeness it is all around them from architecture to cooking they are very family orientated people and therefore traditional skills are taught from generation to generation it is bred into them to be team builders to create and get exactly what they want and need
936076 we have been in this market for nearly two years and already have very loyal customers which include large companies such as asteco and nakheel through to high end interior designers and many private clients
936077 many people still dont know us but when they come to our showroom on shaikh zayed road near interchange four both young and older customers fall in love with our hand crafted furniture as it covers a wide spectrum from classical through to modern we also have our own interior designer who can suggest free space planning layouts we have over 1 200 furniture pieces to choose from so there is something for everyone
936078 we try to be innovative sourcing quality products to suit all budgets for our kitchens and bathrooms many of these products are made in italy and have the harmonious combination of artistry functionality comfort and durability in them i consider these products not only breathtakingly beautiful but also best for the use they are designed
936079 to date ferretti is the only european manufacturer to maintain a full presence in the uae and provide the same service in the uae as in italy and europe in general
936080 i admire italian craftsmanship in engineering products such as water pumps and in their bathroom fixtures
936081 they are truly the pioneers in water pump technology and most of the popular brands available here are italian made bagno designer bath solutions include several italian designed products in their range
936082 cultures are learning to mix constantly as the melting pot rapidly increases due to the amount of people moving to the uae
936083 therefore people are changing their ideas and styles and are open to new suggestions

936102 there is no difference between rulings or righteous deeds we do not take any of them from daeef reports rather no one has the right to use any report as evidence unless it is proven to be soundly narrated from the messenger of allaah sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam in a saheeh or hasan hadeeth
936103 these reports about worship and fasting an the 15th of shabaan became very well known in some countries which were overwhelmed by ignorance one should not be deceived by the large numbers of ignorant people who do these things
936104 i never saw the messenger of allaah fasting for an entire month except in ramadaan and i never saw him fast more than he did in shabaan
936105 the oil companies need to know that there is a limit on how much profit they can take in this economy

936107 we have organised a roadshow in kolkata to popularise our dream season offer and attract more tourists from this part of the country
936108 we took this decision to cut expenses the electricity charge and the use of generators during power cuts have pushed up the cost of operations
936109 i have been fascinated to see the uaes progress over the past 20 years since i was posted in baghdad in the mid 1980s the region and its future is of vital interest to my country and i very much look forward to my tenure here the areas of cooperation between the two countries are already extensive but we also have to be responsive to the scope and scale of change in the uae and while close security cooperation provides an essential underpinning promoting an even more intense commercial cooperation at the level of both the large corporations and the small and medium sized enterprises remains the core of my job
936110 the uae market is now intensely competitive notwithstanding our long shared history we need to take a hardheaded reality check as to how to plan for the future we have to show the new generations of emiratis why their countrys relationship with the uk remains central to their future only then will it be possible for british business to beat the competition for share in the local market our common history our english language our present performance all will help so while we maximise our present position we also need to build for the future across all fields political defence economic commercial law and order and academic
936111 blessed with oil wealth there can be no doubt about the commitment of the new political leadership of the uae to transform the country embracing not just the full utilisation of their energy resources but also the immense possibilities of globalisation to propel the uae to a leadership position economically and increasingly politically as well every one of us cannot fail to be impressed by the sheer scale of ambition but also by the commitment to implementation
936112 this sharp commercial focus will be complemented with action at the political level to reflect the relationship in many other fields as well as by enhancing crucial areas of service delivery such as the passport and visa service
936113 children are the future and many students from the uae travel to the uk to broaden their horizons it is a huge priority for me to strengthen the education and healthcare links between both countries we have already made some promising starts such as the joint enterprise between imperial college london and mubadala to establish the diabetes institute
936114 even against that long history our relationship is embarking on a particularly strong stage of growth over a million british tourists will vacation in the uae this year and more than 120 000 british citizens are currently living and working in the uae
936115 during my tenure here i would like to ensure that we lay a firm foundation for the two countries to remain the closest friends and partners not just for the next five but for the next 50 years there has always been a special relationship between us and we need to build for the next generation as well as for the present one
936116 the present level of dialogue can be gauged from the fact that general shaikh mohammad bin zayed al nahyan crown prince of abu dhabi and deputy supreme commander of the uae armed forces and prime minister tony blair have met three times in the last year
936117 emiratis have a right to be confident that their uk partners will be with them over the years ahead in trickier as well as good times from our side we are fully committed to helping our emirati friends build their country further and to investing both financially and in human terms in their future
936118 my report to the country is of rising employment and rising investment continuing low inflation and low interest and mortgage rates and this is a budget to expand prosperity and fairness for britains families and it is built on the foundation of the longest period of economic stability and sustained growth in our countrys history

936121 i have focused on families by raising child benefits and child tax credits taking 200 000 more children out of poverty done more to support pensioners by taking 600 000 out of tax by raising the level of tax free allowances and i have improved work incentives for lower income families with children by raising the minimum income from work to 290 about dh2 114 for a 35 hour week
936122 to reward work to ensure working families are better off and to make the tax system fairer i will from next april cut the basic rate of income tax from 22 pence down to 20 pence the lowest basic rate for 75 years
936123 set out long term reforms and build a britain of high aspiration and achievement for the years to come
936124 the 11 hectares area earmarked for lion safari in kozhikode district is too less not as per cza guidelines
936125 hence we denied permission and instead referred the proposal back to the state asking it to either extend the area or shelve it
936126 we are seriously thinking to have another lion safari in gods own country
936127 as per cza guidelines we are looking for spacious parks to bring at least six asiatic lions for wildlife enthusiasts to catch a glimpse of the endangered species

936134 de weg naar de hemel loopt door benauwdheid en droefenis als u niet zo zwart bent als de zwartste en zo ellendig als de ellendigste dan bent u een vreemdeling van god en moet u niet over christus praten het ligt zo diep we moeten belijden hoe slecht we het er afgebracht hebben en een schandvlek worden in eigen ogen we moeten alles verliezen wat moeten we met christus doen als we niet leren dat we van onszelf geen plaats voor hem hebben

936139 the gdp grew by 2 7 per cent which was among the highest in the g7 countries and was driven mainly by consumer spending and foreign direct investment fdi provinces with heavy natural resource based economies including alberta british columbia manitoba and newfoundland performed the best the unemployment rate at 6 3 per cent was also the lowest in 30 years
936140 the volume of each has grown dramatically in the past 25 years canadian direct investment abroad and fdi in the country posted the highest percentage increases last year since the technology boom in 2000 investment in canada from abroad grew by 10 1 per cent in 2006 reaching c 448 9 billion about dh1 570 billion canadas investment abroad also grew impressively reaching c 523 3 billion about dh1 830 billion or 13 8 per cent more than the year before although much of this was due to the appreciation of the canadian dollar
936141 our total exports of goods and services in 2006 grew by 1 1 per cent to c 523 7 billion about dh1 832 billion or 36 4 per cent of canadas gross domestic product making us one of the most trade dependent economies in the world imports of goods and services grew by 4 2 per cent to reach c 486 5 billion about dh1 702 billion leaving a positive trade balance of c 37 2 billion about dh130 billion in 2006
936142 the composition of canadas export goods package has changed over the past several years with industrial goods and materials offsetting declines in consumer goods machinery and equipment automotive forestry and energy products
936143 the nafta which comprises canada the us and mexico has played an important role in canadas economic growth over the past decade stimulating expansion of our trade and investment links with our southern neighbours nafta built upon the canada usa free trade agreement signed five years earlier
936144 in 2006 the uae was canadas most important export market for merchandise goods in the whole middle east and north africa region together with service exports and uae exports to canada our two countries enjoy a billion dollar trading relationship investment flows in both directions are also growing including recent significant uae investments in canadas transportation and energy sectors there are more than 100 canadian companies in the uae representing a wide range of sectors industries and professions there are also two active and well supported business organisations the canadian business council of dubai and the northern emirates and the canadian business council of abu dhabi
936145 growth in inflation adjusted personal expenditures has accounted for at least half the increase in real gross domestic product gdp in all but one of the last nine quarters during the last two quarters when economic growth fell below its long term trend rate growth in consumer spending jumped to more than 100 per cent of the increase in real gdp
936146 canadian economy is projected to grow by 2 2 per cent in 2007 and 2 7 per cent in both 2008 and 2009 returning to its production capacity in the second half of 2007 and remaining there through 2008 and 2009
936147 that core inflation should remain slightly above two per cent over the coming months considering pressures on capacity and the impact of higher core food prices however upward pressure on core inflation is expected to moderate bringing core inflation back to two per cent by the end of 2007
936148 given the importance of the us as a trade and investment partner there is always a close lookout for the slowing down of the us economy and its impact on our exports and fdis from the us
936149 the american economic slowdown in the latter part of 2006 along with a stronger canadian dollar had an impact on our manufacturing sector

936151 pertanyaan macam apa itu tentu saja dingin itu ada kamu tidak pernah sakit flu
936152 sekali lagi anda salah pak gelap itu juga tidak ada gelap adalah keadaan dimana tidak ada cahaya cahaya bisa kita pelajari gelap tidak kita bisa menggunakan prisma newton untuk memecahkan cahaya menjadi beberapa warna dan mempelajari berbagai panjang gelombang setiap warna tapi anda tidak bisa mengukur gelap seberapa gelap suatu ruangan diukur dengan berapa intensitas cahaya di ruangan tersebut kata gelap dipakai manusia untuk mendeskripsikan ketiadaan cahaya
936153 tentu saja seperti yang telah kukatakan sebelumnya kita melihat setiap hari di koran dan tv banyak perkara kriminal dan kekerasan di antara manusia perkara perkara tersebut adalah manifestasi dari kejahatan
936154 sekali lagi anda salah pak kajahatan itu tidak ada kejahatan adalah ketiadaan tuhan seperti dingin atau gelap kajahatan adalah kata yang dipakai manusia untuk mendeskripsikan ketiadaan tuhan tuhan tidak menciptakan kajahatan kajahatan adalah hasil dari tidak adanya kasih tuhan dihati manusia seperti dingin yang timbul dari ketiadaan panas dan gelap yang timbul dari ketiadaan cahaya

936160 japans exports grew 8 2 per cent year on year in 2006 to reach 647 3 billion about dh2 380 8 billion while imports rose 11 7 per cent to 579 3 billion about dh2 130 6 billion japans net outward foreign direct investments fdi grew 10 3 per cent year on year to 50 2 billion about dh184 6 billion in 2006 topping the previous record set in 1990
936161 the field of biotechnology is also growing in japan the mobile penetration rate is very high and the telecommunication industry is booming a strong middle class good education system and creation of new businesses like the internet business and a new retail network have all led to the development of japan the country also has a very well developed environment technology and conducts research in the area of solar power generation and other energy saving areas
936162 as a result of these factors the automobile sector is seeing no new demand new car sales have therefore gradually decreased
936163 today toyota is the largest exporter in turkey with a production rate of 150 000 units per year nissan has also started production in cairo with 15 000 units per year
936164 japanese cars have a good reputation because they are priced reasonably offer good performance and are fuel efficient durable and have excellent maintenance services
936165 in my opinion the dominance of the japanese automotive sector is due to the low cost technology used compared to the european or american cars in fact if we make an analysis based on quality technology and price the value for money and high resale price makes them better than their competitors
936166 just in time supply mass production allowed good quality cars to be produced at lower costs and this was the start of japans success in the automotive sector and it continues even today engineering skill and prowess seen in examples such as the vtec engine variable valve timing and lift electronic control engines and hybrid cars is another key factor another crucial reason for their success is that the japanese are good at finding out about what people want in their cars and then building them
936167 mitsubishi has been performing very well especially for the last three years and we are expecting to hit a higher target than what we have set during 2007 for two years we have been ranked number two on the automotive market chart all of our mitsubishi models are selling well but we have to give due credit to our two heroes the lancer and pajero
936168 the car is completely refurbished we also launched new models of pajero lancer ex and the outlander this year
936169 the addition of these new models has helped us achieve an outstanding sales performance in 2006 with toyota sales up 25 per cent over 2005 strong customer demand for our vehicles has continued into 2007 in the first eight months of this year toyota sales were up 29 per cent on the same period last year
936170 the gcc is one of the fastest growing auto markets today
936171 over the last 50 years we have built a reputation that is based on product quality and after sales excellence our vehicle line up has also expanded from pick ups and suvs to include vehicles in all segments we have the largest suv line up in the middle east
936172 our line up also includes small and medium sedans such as the tiida sunny and altima among our range of passenger vehicles the nissan tiida is one of our top selling models in the region the infiniti range is doing very well in the luxury segment and is the fastest growing japanese luxury brand in the region in addition to this our success is also linked to our strong distribution network in the region
936173 domestic demand for passenger cars trucks and buses should total 5 63 million units while domestic demand for motorcycles should reach 720 000
936174 the reputation for reliability and a good after sales service at affordable prices are what distinguish japanese electronics from other electronics worldwide
936175 continuous investment in research and development also makes the demand for their products very high
936176 the reliability of semiconductors manufactured by japanese companies is one of their pillars of strength japanese electronic product manufacturers have a very strong tie up with semiconductor manufacturers from japan
936177 this gives them advanced information on the improvements that have been achieved in terms of performance and lowered costs of semiconductor devices the consumer electronics manufacturers are able to leverage these advantages by incorporating them into new products to be brought to market
936178 over the years brand leaders such as sony panasonic and brother have consistently brought innovative products to the middle eastern market and have met their commitments in terms of reliability we expect to grow at 25 per cent per annum which is in line with our targets for the region
936179 reliability durability and excellent after sales service is what makes japanese electronics stand out worldwide the industry is also ahead in terms of the latest technology that is on offer and being developed
936180 at panasonic we have witnessed a steady two digit growth over the last five years or so most brands have a long history in the middle east and command loyalty from local buyers
936181 the development of innovative world first technology and product quality are the primary reasons for a strong presence of japanese brands in the electronics market

936206 that shaban is a month between rajab and ramadan which is neglected by many people and it is a month in which an account of the deeds of human beings is presented before the lord of the universe so i wish that my deeds be presented at a time when i am in a state of fasting

936213 perhaps i need to let go of the way i have looked at the world and start looking to the spiritual world instead of seeking my security and identity in this transient world where everything can change in a moment

936221 my children i wish that the holy mass be for you the gift of the day attend it wish for it to begin jesus gives himself to you during the mass thus look forward to that moment when you are cleansed pray very much so that the holy spirit will renew your parish if people attend mass with lukewarmness they will return to their homes cold and with an empty heart
936222 i now realize i did not have to come to medjugorje because i have jesus in the eucharist in the mass
936223 yes you did have to come here because it is here where you learned that lesson
936224 may holy mass little children not be a habit for you but life by living holy mass each day you will feel the need for holiness and you will grow in holiness
936225 this is how people should live its so beautiful to see you all drop everything and trail to the field

936247 wahai janganlah kamu main judi karena judi menjadikan istri anak keluargamu menjadi susah dan untuk memnuhi keinginan judi itu membawa dirimu kearah perbuatan jahat yaitu merampok amp mencuri aku membenci perbuatan itu karenanya janganlah berjudi
936248 begini coba anda perhatikan di depan sana di jalanan untuk menyadari bahwa tuhan itu tidak ada katakan kepadaku jika tuhan itu ada adakah yang sakit adakah anak terlantar jika tuhan ada tidak akan ada sakit ataupun kesusahan saya tidak dapat membayangkan tuhan yang maha penyayang akan membiarkan ini semua terjadi
936249 tukang cukur itu tidak ada sebab jika ada tidak akan ada orang dengan rambut panjang yang kotor dan brewokan seperti orang yang di luar sana
936250 apa yang kamu lihat itu adalah salah mereka sendiri kenapa mereka tidak datang ke saya
936251 wah baru kali ini saya mendengar seorang pencuri seperti itu
936252 saya sudah muak dengan agama saya malas membaca kitab suci lagi termasuk baca bhagavad gita bukankah justru gara gara ayat ayat suci itu manusia saling berperang
936253 saya pribadi berpendapat bahwa konflik itu tidak akan pernah selesai soalnya kalau mau jujur konflik itu diilhami dan dilandasi oleh perintah perintah kitab suci masing masing kelompok itu
936254 lho ngeri baca kitab suci kok malah ngeri mengapa begitu
936255 ah ternyata bhagavad gita itu tidak pantas disebut kitab suci masak sih kitab suci kok isinya menganjurkan perang dan pembunuhan lagi pula disabdakannya khan di medan perang
936256 wahai arjuna engkau akan terbunuh di medan perang dan mencapai planet planet surga atau engkau akan menang dan menikmati kerajaan di dunia
936257 bukankah tawaran masuk sorga itu yang mengilhami para pengebom bali dan para pembela tuhan lainnya melakukan teror dan berbagai tindak kejahatan
936258 nah kalau krishna mendesak arjuna untuk membunuh bhisma drona dan para kaurawa yang masih sanak saudara sendiri hanya demi masuk surga apa itu bukan amoral namanya
936259 bhagavad gita adalah sumber kedamaian bagiku manakala keputusasaan datang menghampiri aku membuka lembaran lembaran gita dan selalu kutemukan ayat yang memberikan pengharapan
936260 orang yang tidak digerakkan oleh keakuan palsu dan kecerdasannya tidak terikat tidak membunuh meskipun ia membunuh orang di dunia ini ia juga tidak terikat oleh perbuatannya
936261 makna ayat ayat bhagavad gita ini tampaknya didasari pada cita cita ideal di dunia hayalan yang sulit ditemukan contohnya di dunia nyata ini
936262 wahai pandawa jangankan lima desa tanah seluas ujung jarum pun tidak akan aku relakan untuk kalian
936263 sifat mulia sifat agung yang tumbuh dari pengetahuan yang benar
936264 sambil berbicara dengan cara yang pandai engkau menyesalkan sesuatu yang tidak patut disesalkan orang bijaksana tidak pernah menyesal baik untuk yang masih hidup maupun untuk yang sudah meninggal gita 2 11
936265 wahai putra keluarga bharata dia yang tinggal dalam badan tidak pernah dapat dibunuh
936266 wahai arjuna berbahagialah para ksatriya yang mendapat kesempatan untuk bertempur seperti itu tanpa mencarinya kesempatan yang membuka pintu gerbang planet planet surga bagi mereka
936267 akan tetapi kalau engkau tidak melaksanakan kewajiban dharma mu yaitu bertempur engkau pasti akan menerima dosa akibat melalaikan kewajibanmu dan dengan demikian kemashyuranmu sebagai ksatriya akan hilang
936268 orang akan selalu membicarakan engkau sebagai orang yang hina dan bagi orang yang terhormat penghinaan lebih buruk daripada kematian
936269 jendral jendral besar yang sangat menghargai nama dan kemashyuranmu akan menganggap engkau meninggalkan medan perang karena rasa takut saja dan dengan demikian mereka akan meremehkan engkau
936270 musuh musuhmu akan menjuluki engkau dengan banyak kata yang tidak baik dan mengejek kesanggupanmu apa yang dapat lebih menyakiti hatimu daripada itu
936271 wahai putra kunti engkau akan terbunuh di medan perang dan mencapai planet planet surga atau engkau akan menang perang dan menikmati kerajaan di dunia karena itu bangunlah dan bertempur dengan ketabahan hati
936272 bertempurlah demi pertempuran saja tanpa mempertimbangkan suka atau duka rugi atau laba menang atau kalah dengan demikian engkau tidak akan dipengaruhi oleh dosa
936273 kalau memang kebenaranlah yang berhasil seperti yang ditegaskan oleh pierce dan para pengikut filsafat pragmatisme maka pasti ada kebenaran dalam bhagavad gita menurut aslinya sebab para pengikut ajarannya memperlihatkan ketenangan dan keriangan yang jarang ditemukan dalam kehidupan masyarakat dewasa ini yang pada umumnya hambar dan keras
936274 ohhh kasihan kamu tetapi kamu kan sudah mati apa daya aku sedang kelaparan maafkan daku
936275 siapa aku dari mana aku datang kemana aku akan pergi

936309 i had a very complicated childhood very difficult very painful
936310 my mothers big phobia was that i would grow she spent her time measuring my height she wouldnt let me go outside because shed heard that fresh air makes children grow and thats why i was kept at home it was completely traumatic
936311 i weighed 10 pounds more and i kept thinking im heavier than that heavy gas cylinder so i am a burden on my mother and thats when i thought about wanting to lose weight to stop my growth i dropped to about 58 pounds my meal was reduced to two squares of chocolate and five cornflakes thats all i ate all day
936312 i know that it will take time but i would rather go slowly and surely rather than gain weight rapidly and then fall back into losing it again
936313 i have to get used to how i look with more weight
936314 i have suffered enormously from the way people look at me
936315 when i first moved to marseille nobody spoke to me people stared at me i stopped going out of my house in cafes and bars they refuse to serve me and thats why i refused to talk about it for such a long time i was so afraid of people judging me people just think you just stop eating but that is not what anorexia is you dont just decide from one day to the next to stop eating its very hard its real suffering and it goes deep
936316 and i hope my body will allow me to my doctor says its possible im still not having periods my body is too weak but he says it is possible then for a relationship i dont know yet im with somebody now i dont want to say very much because its a bit complicated at the moment its more an affair of the heart than a physical relationship because simply im still very thin and its still very difficult to enjoy normal physical relations with such a tiny body and a man who is a normal size im still nervous about having sex
936317 and to send the message that life is beautiful and it is worth living you can get better by fighting and believing and by living your passion and the theatre is my passion and i hope to be able to realize my dream to continue with that passion

936331 the events in tibet this spring as well as protests regarding the torch relay was a worldwide negative campaign for the olympics in beijing the negative headlines that have appeared non stop lately have caused unforeseen publicity for the major ioc sponsors it remains to be seen if that kind of publicity is desirable

936333 id fixed august 1 as the deadline with both the potential sponsors and the riders and team staff the sponsors said no and at the moment i havent got any other offers

936350 after having been let down by traditional pensions over the last 20 years many business owners chose to invest in buy to let properties to build assets for their retirement

936352 we all dream of putting our feet up and feeling the sand between our toes but the reality is that many of the uks business owners feel further away from realising those dreams today than they were last year

936370 de nek en letsel aan de nek is altijd een fascinatie van mij geweest
936371 ook mijn kennis van en betrokkenheid bij fysiotherapie en manuele therapie de disciplines die zich van oudsher voor de behandeling van nekklachten hebben opgeworpen is een motivatie geweest om me daarin te verdiepen steeds als pati nten bij mij kwamen met problemen van een stijve nek minder goed kunnen bewegen klachten over duizeligheid oogbewegingsstoornissen of concentratieproblemen heb ik me voortdurend de vraag gesteld wat steekt daar nou precies achter
936372 dit onderzoek naar die zintuigcellen zette mij aan het denken toen we steeds vaker werden geconfronteerd met mensen die een verstuiking van de nek hadden ondergaan maar die niet zoals bij een verstuiking van de voet na drie tot zes weken genezen waren maar pas na zes maanden een jaar of twee jaar of zelfs nog langer klachten hielden wat zijn dan zo vroeg ik mij af de verschillen tussen een verstuiking van de voet en een verstuiking van de nek het belangrijkste verschil is dat de spiergroepen in de nek veel meer van die zintuigcellen bevatten dan de simpele spiergroepen rond een enkelgewricht letsel van de nek heeft daardoor een stroom van desinformatie vanuit de zintuigcellen tot gevolg die veel omvangrijker is dan bij een verstuiking van een enkel in feite heeft hetzelfde soort letsel daardoor een ander soort reactie tot gevolg
936373 na een whiplash ontstaat als het ware een niet oplosbaar intersensorisch conflict de verstoorde informatie uit de nek wordt geconfronteerd met informatie vanuit de ogen en informatie vanuit het evenwichtssysteem deze drie vormen van informatie moeten tot een compromis leiden n taal spreken en n uitkomst hebben maar door die voortdurend verstoorde invloed vanuit de nek wordt er geen compromis bereikt en is er geen eenduidige uitkomst er bestaat voortdurend een conflict in informatie dat is mede de basis voor het hebben en houden van klachten die met het evenwicht het zien en met concentratie hebben te maken
936374 als iemand in de gelegenheid wordt gesteld om zelf weer zijn weg te vinden in het arbeidsproces of in de werkzaamheden thuis en geleidelijk aan merkt dat de klachten afnemen dan komt hij er wel en is er niet zon probleem
936375 dat vanuit de werksituatie begrip bestaat voor een pati nt die een letsel heeft ondergaan ik maakte bijvoorbeeld mee dat een taxichauffeur binnen drie weken werd gedwongen om weer actief aan het verkeer deel te nemen dat betekent onder andere dat hij weer in staat moet zijn om zijn hoofd fors linksom te draaien om over zijn schouder te kijken dat zijn natuurlijk niet de ideale omstandigheden meestal is er wel begrip aanwezig zowel bij de werkgever als bij de begeleidende bedrijfsarts maar vaak houdt dat begrip niet aan omdat er aan de pati nt weinig is te zien toch moet je als er ook echt een bandletsel is net als bij een verzwikte voet rekening houden met hersteltijden van een jaar of langer na een letsel is de helft van het bindweefsel pas na zes of acht maanden hersteld en pas daarna kun je het bij wijze van spreken weer maximaal gaan belasten tot die tijd hoeft de pati nt niet altijd klachten te ondervinden maar kan hij nog wel in enige mate worden beperkt door de blessure die hij heeft ondergaan veel mensen weten dit niet of nauwelijks en het begrip ervoor is lang niet altijd aanwezig
936376 het herstel wordt erg bepaald door de wijze waarop mensen in hun werk met hun lichaam omgaan ik heb de indruk dat ik in mijn praktijk minder mensen tegenkom die in een overall werken dan kantoormedewerkers die bijvoorbeeld langdurig in dezelfde houding achter een computer zitten het is stellig mijn indruk dat deze mensen langer last houden de man die in een fabriek op een werkplaats of in een atelier werkt verricht toch iets gemakkelijker een variatie aan handelingen waardoor het voor de spieren en de nek ook gemakkelijker wordt om zich te voegen aan het patroon van herstel daarentegen is aanhoudend in n houding werkzaamheden verrichten en dan vooral als mensen achter de computer hun nekspieren aanspannen om het hoofd iets naar beneden gericht te houden een extra belastende factor voor de genezing
936377 ik heb het idee dat mensen die met weinig werkdruk kunnen presteren beter af zijn dan mensen die een hoge werkdruk hebben als je onder druk moet werken dan reageert het lichaam daar met een zekere afweerspanning op een gezonde spanning is niet slecht integendeel maar aanhoudende spanning bij een pati nt met een whiplashletsel kan snel te veel spanning betekenen en daardoor ongunstig voor het herstelproces zijn wat dat betreft zou het gewenst zijn om deze mensen wat langere tijd een beetje in de watten te leggen en ten aanzien van werktijden en werkwijzen te ontzien daaruit zou dan ook weer het begrip vanuit de werksituatie blijken het is mijn ervaring dat als dat begrip er is de pati nt weer heel snel zijn grenzen naar normale werktijden gaat verleggen
936378 het is een krenkend letsel het wordt de betrokkene aangedaan door een aanrijding van achteren uit de statistieken blijkt dat het toch vaak wat jongere mensen zijn die het ondergaan jongere mensen die eigenlijk in hun hele levenswijze geen rekening hebben gehouden met het feit dat er een kink in de kabel kan komen ze denken aan hun opleiding hun carri re hun gezin er moet een heleboel gebeuren en daar past het niet bij om op een ander tempo terug te schakelen of om zelfs stoelen wat te verplaatsen onze hele maatschappij is daar eigenlijk onvoldoende op ingesteld wie daarentegen de rijpheid de ervaring en de stijl heeft om snel een compromis met zichzelf te vinden zal merken dat het in zijn eigen voordeel is om inderdaad een aantal zaken achterwege te laten doelen wat uit te stellen en flexibel met de gerezen problemen om te gaan als je de persoonlijkheid en het karakter hebt om te overwinnen wat jou is aangedaan en om daar een positieve instelling tegenover te stellen dan breng je een goed eigen aandeel in het herstelproces in als je dat niet goed lukt dan is dat weer een van de hindernissen die je daarbij kunt ondervinden
936379 neurologen kunnen van oudsher weinig of geen belangstelling voor het whiplashletsel opbrengen ze zien het niet als een serieus probleem maar vooral als een zaak die meer met psychische reactievorming rond het gebeuren samenhangt dan met een wezenlijk organisch probleem als neuroloog scoor je met andere woorden niet met het whiplashprobleem neurologen hebben er weinig sympathie voor en zijn vaak onvoldoende op de hoogte van de onderzoeksresultaten op dit gebied pati nten van mij zijn door het aeromedisch instituut in soesterberg onderzocht waar bijvoorbeeld ook straaljagerpiloten op extreme belastbaarheid worden getraind en getest daar werd vastgesteld dat er inderdaad sprake was van een intersensorisch conflict tussen informatiestromen als het lichaam zich hieraan niet aanpast is er een kans op het chronisch worden van dit soort klachten deze visies krijgen echter geen gehoor omdat er gewoon weinig bereidheid is om over dit soort zaken na te denken

936413 we need to get the message out there that heart attacks on the silver screen and tv arent what people usually experience
936414 there are so many symptoms the thing is if you are feeling very unwell not like yourself and you have that little suspicion this doubt in your mind that you are maybe having a heart attack dont delay call 999
936415 i was really surprised to find out id had a heart attack because they always show people on television shows like coronation street keeling over but my experience wasnt anything like that

936419 the truth is that in the uk for the past 10 years or more somewhere between 200 and 300 people have been dying every year from accidental ingestion perhaps from overdose many of them old or confused or vulnerable young people often people who werent actually prescribed the drug at all and thats the target of this change

936424 cleaning sprays especially air fresheners furniture cleaners and glass cleaners had a particularly strong effect the risk of developing asthma increased with the frequency of cleaning and number of different sprays used but on average was 30 to 50 percent higher in people regularly exposed to cleaning sprays than in others
936425 cleaning sprays for sale in all supermarkets are not harmless and their use may involve serious health risks
936426 nevertheless from the perspective of precaution we may recommend to use sprays only when really necessary in most cases it is possible to replace the spray by non spray cleaning liquids and to do the cleaning properly if sprays are used people can protect themselves by opening windows avoiding the application near the breathing zone and by using masks or other types of personal respiratory protection
936427 cleaning compounds are generally just tested to make sure that they dont kill people or cause cancer
936428 but these products may not be safe for asthmatics to breathe in and if its not safe for asthmatics its probably not safe for anyone else
936429 switch to liquid cleaning products rather than aerosols if theres any difference in cleaning its a small sacrifice to be made in terms of protecting your respiratory health

936454 this technology is a potential asset in the fight against gun crime by notifying police as soon as a shot is fired it could save invaluable time in reaching a crime scene
936455 part of its use is as a deterrent when criminals know they can be heard and found they are more likely to think twice before using firearms twenty nine different police forces wouldnt put their faith in technology that didnt work
936456 there wasnt anything in it about killing people it was about how to live a good life
936457 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight
936458 this move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead it is about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
936459 but at the end of the day parents bring up children not the government schools or health services
936460 every parent wants their child to be fit and healthy so it is only right to help them make informed decisions about their lives
936461 it is clear that growth models in our industry based on high and increasing leverage will no longer be sustainable it is also clear that complexity in financial services and the recent consequences of failed risk management needs to be addressed
936462 along with its supervisors our industry including lenders underwriters and investors needs to reflect on the lessons for risk management capital adequacy and funding

936547 the touring lifestyle and playing on stage every night as well as making this band our entire lives and our profession had overtime become stale and anxiety ridden for me and singer laura nichol and in the end not enjoyable anymore we started this band because we loved playing this kind of music and loved the release that we got out of it and the satisfaction we got from jamming with our friends and taking it across the country the fact that it had not been that way for a while was enough reason for us to hang it up and leave the band as six years of amazing memories and amazing accomplishments

936660 you program the ipod mix the punch dim the lights and at 8 oclock people show up and then who knows what is going to happen
936661 what we really needed were people who understood online organizing
936662 but many of the editors just didnt have much experience with the internet
936663 is that you have to be waaaay clearer in what you ask contributors to do just because they show up once doesnt mean theyll show up over and over you have to engage them right away
936664 the process of elimination is undervalued whats wrong with trying something assessing and taking it as positive information that this particular model doesnt work thats not failure thats important information
936665 the difference between an amateur journalism production and a command and control system like a newsroom is profound and decisive
936666 the first post about the records hit the site at 1 04 am within half and hour there were 50 summaries posted by readers gleaning the documents by 4 30 am more than 220 postings were up detailing various aspects of the files
936667 we think of our members as an army of eyes and ears
936668 what we learned from the experiments with citizen journalism is that people are great at recording what they see or taking pictures but not so great at analysis and horrible at packaging
936669 its a big world out there we use nowpublic to get a more comprehensive map of coverage an additional radar system beyond our own correspondents
936670 we want as much image coverage as we can get when we talk about crowdsourcing its focused on finding a good nugget that would add to our report but i think it will add up to much more than that eventually i can imagine a whole lot of contributions amateurs as well as professionals that could be woven into the coverage
936671 the first post about the records hit the site at 1 04 am within half and hour there were 50 summaries posted by readers gleaning the documents
936672 ive always told people i have the best job in the world
936673 the teams thoughts are with craigs family and friends at this very difficult time
936674 craigs family passes on its thanks to all well wishers
936675 only so many as and bs are awarded in each class irrespective of the performance of the rest of the students in the class underlying this practice is the philosophy that if all of the children received high marks grades would lose their value to motivate student performance the result therefore is that many students are not motivated to work hard because they know that they have little chance of beating out the best students for a good grade
936676 while there is much talk in american society about the importance of hard work and its relationship to success in life
936677 most americans act as though innate abilities are the primary determinants of their most important accomplishments
936678 there is a great deal of evidence that an enormous amount of effort on the part of children not to mention their parents and teachers is wasted
936679 the school is only one of the two principal socializing institutions in society the other being the family
936680 next year through bribery or trickery i hope to persuade ken bernstein teacher and blogger par excellence to select his favorite blogs and then let me dump on his choices or something like that

936682 spin cycle how research gets used in policy debates the case of charter schools
936683 be trained to think more like political actors and encouraged to frame their research questions in terms that facilitate their incorporation into the spheres of politics and governance
936684 no single randomized field trial no matter how well conducted could have settled the question of how charter schools perform under changing circumstances
936685 if there is a single factor that seems to distinguish colleges and universities that have truly made a difference on behalf of minority students it is attention
936686 successful colleges pay attention to graduation rates they monitor year to year change study the impact of different interventions on student outcomes break down the numbers among different student populations and continuously ask themselves how they could improve essentially they apply the academic values of empiricism and deep inquiry to themselves
936687 using funds from the state funded college reach out program care staffers start recruiting low income students from local schools in surrounding communities as early as the sixth grade talking to guidance counselors and identifying potential candidates from the list of students eligible for the federal free and reduced price lunch program care meets with the students parents providing them with information about what they need to do to help their children get to college and succeed there beginning in ninth grade care provides a series of summer and after school programs that help students negotiate the often baffling financial aid application process complete college applications and study for the sat and act
936688 they can apply to florida state through a care program that relaxes admissions standards for low income first generation students if they agree to participate in an academic support program that begins the summer before matriculation and extends through the first two years of college due to the socioeconomic makeup of the state and surrounding areas in tallahassee roughly two thirds of care students are black
936689 the price we pay economic and social consequences of inadequate education
936690 the college board would like to continue the expansion of the ap program and suggests that equity demands all students have access to the most advanced instruction high schools can provide
936691 the back story of ap expansion however is not that it is a means of benefiting minorities but that it has become an out of control shootout for top students vying for spots at selective colleges before we invest more dollars in expanding the advanced placement program we must provide the pre ap infrastructure in our middle schools to ensure that students are prepared to meet the challenges of the program otherwise we can expect that our ap failure rates will continue to climb
936692 there was a dozen ideas proffered about how to trigger a war the one that interested me the most was why dont we build we in our shipyard build four or five boats that look like iranian pt patrol torpedo boats put navy seals on them with a lot of arms and next time one of our boats goes to the straits of hormuz start a shoot up
936693 name changes are nothing new they happen for a variety of reasons sometimes to reflect a change in community to honour politicians or local heroes or replace the names of those who have disgraced themselves or fallen from favour streets are often renamed to recognise international cause celebres and so on
936694 but the most widespread changes take place following political regime changes sometimes brought about by war or conflict this has been the situation through a large part of the african continent following the gaining of independence by various countries previously under colonial control sometimes the motivation is language based some name changes are strictly commercial
936695 for as long as there has been culture people have placed a meaning by naming every event they have encountered be it the birth of a child climatic conditions initiation rites battles death or any other event that seems vital to their daily existence it has been a way of giving life meaning a way of claiming territory a way of honouring leaders a way of giving direction or location a way of celebrating important events and mourning disastrous events
936696 the naming of streets and public places after memorable events is a way of etching the countrys history both pleasant and not in peoples memory
936697 names should as far as possible be after themes such as flora and fauna colours geographical features historical events et cetera only in rare cases should peoples names be used
936698 the renaming of streets and public places should only be done where there is a demonstrable need motivated as per the provisions of this policy so as to curb unnecessary expense
936699 naming after living people should be avoided and only be done in exceptional cases
936700 names should promote a sense of ownership and the character of the area
936701 names should be in keeping with the theme of an area such that they have local relevance
936702 changes of names for public buildings facilities and public open spaces shall only be approved when they do not violate historical or common usage names
936703 to assist in the prioritising of streets and public places to be renamed a strong motivation is to be provided in cases where a name change is proposed
936704 where the name change is desirable to promote the goodwill of people now living in the new south africa
936705 where the change in name will assist in building a sense of ownership and community and redefining society change
936706 lest we forget where the market originally was the busy street running on the southern side of the town hall will remind us
936707 the origin of this artery which runs from one end of the witwatersrand to the other can be traced to the wheel tracks of the pioneers cut by their ox wagons mail coaches and other conveyances when in 1886 the incredible truth had been published that the gold beds were more or less continuous over scores of miles according to environs of the golden city and pretoria
936708 the volksraad would assent to the construction of a road along the main reef from roodepoort to boksburg
936709 ninepence per hour or thirty five shillings per week half day only on saturday being merely relief work when a man has earned 10 pounds he will if necessary have to make way for any other who is in need
936710 32 years ago the mining companies themselves formed a private trust to construct the hard thoroughfare which was officially christened the main reef road or witwatersrand road
936711 that the term main reef may have been first used by sam fox and from this the name of the road derived
936712 the choice of names that were either selected or omitted for public entities is indicative of south africas ghastly past
936713 name changes therefore seek to restore that dignity by affirming that africans too like any peoples anywhere in the world have a history and historical figures that need recognition
936714 after all we have committed ourselves to building a united and non racial society where each individual and community counts equally

936716 the future of our historic landscape calls for mutual understanding between policy makers urban planners city developers architects conservationists property owners investors and concerned citizens working together to preserve the urban heritage while considering the modernisation and development of society in a culturally and historic sensitive manner strengthening identity and social cohesion
936717 taking into account the emotional connection between human beings and their environment their sense of place it is fundamental to guarantee an urban environmental quality of living to contribute to the economic success of a city and to its social and cultural vitality

936719 a lot of saudi money has been put into the north to cultivate wahhabi salafist ideology to counter hezbollah
936720 these radicals see the lebanese army as weak and march 14 sunnis cannot stop them confronting shiites or alawites
936721 at the end of the day it may be the only thing that saves them from the tribunal
936722 the syrians have won the political battle in lebanon and have split the united states from france by opening negotiations with israel
936723 we hope the international community will not allow syria back here
936724 syria is causing unrest to facilitate hezbollah but we trust that the u s will support a democratic and free lebanon
936725 there is a serious need for us to review both our overall strategy and our tactics
936726 what happened in lebanon in may was absolutely foreseeable and probably preventable the bush administrations response remained limited and tactical
936727 to reduce the need for the lebanese to rely on private militias

936730 to speed up that process a group of scientists has harnessed the internet through wikipedia
936731 heres the different product what if a 16 year old could drop out but bank the money that the school district spends per pupil 15 000 here in boston but im sure its more in d
936732 at first for a jonathan lewis nobody bugs you to get up in the morning
936733 the dropout would get a statement every quarter in the mail like a mutual fund which shows the 30 000 plus interest or whatever available for their education
936734 in other words its not that great for society if jonathan manages to creep across the finish line and graduate
936735 not because the ap program is particularly special but because for a moment it provided a glimmer of hope that public education particularly in urban areas was not solely the reserve of those with many other options
936736 we cannot stray from the ap regime a few weeks ago we were rushing through the 1960s with lightning speed the vietnam war is a fog somehow the new frontier turned into the great society which i always confuse with the new freedom the new nationalism and the new federalism and what does core stand for
936737 have dropped the ap curriculum to march to their own drummers
936738 we were even able to have discussions on the lyrics of bruce springsteen and madonna for comparison to the materialistic age of the 1980s
936739 did not require brute memorization but a cognitive constantly changing perception of events causes and effects from the past
936740 when the chef tastes the soup it is formative assessment when the customer tastes the soup it is a summative assessment
936741 the narrowing of test score gaps although an important accomplishment
936742 their test scores are not being harmed during the nclb era but they are not flourishing either gaps are narrowing because the gains of low achieving students are outstripping those of high achievers by a factor of two or three to one the nation has a strong interest in developing the talents of its best students to their fullest to foster the kind of growth at the top end of the achievement distribution that has been occurring at the bottom end
936743 appear as qualified to teach advanced courses as the teachers of high achievers as a whole
936744 just as many colleges are finally beginning to opt out of u
936745 but even people who go in for this sort of thing ought to be appalled because the magazines criteria for success are about standardized tests which measure what matters least
936746 do occasionally rate someone as best buy but mostly they just provide information on a wide range of stuff mostly its not comparative at least overall we are judging apples vs oranges im interested in wagons that are fairly small with four wheel drive and good gas mileage then i get a chance after all to drive it before i buy it and look for little things that matter to me the size of the numbers on the mileage meter the location of certain interior lights the ranking game the constant urge to compare everything whos better etc is a bad and injurious habit i have three kids and i truly cant think of any way of ranking them that makes sense and surely not over time
936747 is more democratic because it rewards those who encourage participation not those who score high obviously there are few schools in the country which can compete with thomas jefferson on achievement measures
936748 i dont think we should be ranking the schools at all in part i just think its unhealthy in part both methods have such a narrow focus its like ranking an athlete or a team on a single measure yes they are ranked but its a competitive arena its like ranking the key school in indianapolis on test scores the school is formed around howard gardners theories of multiple intelligences and many of the things they do each day have nothing to do with test scores
936749 im not liked at home my daughters wish i had never gone to india they wish i had never gone to china
936750 i am your greatest donor you are going to give me the name of a tutor or i am not going to pay my next pledge
936751 but they thought i was insane in india you show your love for your child by getting the best tutors possible in america you get a tutor if your kids having a problem well i disagree with that
936752 we must ensure that any curricular changes that are made are in keeping with our commitment to promoting and sustaining a learning culture that emphasizes the development of well adjusted and well rounded students
936753 financial incentives do not direct or influence any pedagogical initiatives or decisions of the school and they never will
936754 too many asians at this school racialized perceptions and identity formation
936755 among blacks acting white is socially stigmatized but asian students who act white usually occupy the more socially prestigious positions because acting asian is equated with acting foreign or like a nerd acting white among asian people becomes a source of pride and is valued as the ability to assimilate into american society while both performances are frequently practiced the asian students who acted white are more likely to achieve extracurricular activity status within the school which often led to admissions into more prestigious colleges
936756 one of the most alarming features of my research was how asian students who went to harvard were very aware of and often shied away from having too many asian friends they saw having only white friends as sort of a badge of honor
936757 negative connotations of being competitive lacking passion and being calculating
936758 that the increasing percentage of asian students at the school threatened the culture of the school hchs prided itself on being a school that fostered student leadership through a plethora of student clubs sports teams and artistic groups students attested that the growing asian student population had detracted from the creativity and independence that had defined hchss activity scene as the asian students focused primarily on their academic studies those asian students who were active in extracurricular activities were perceived to be disingenuous

936793 a rather scarily long list of great ideas for ways to support the community
936794 weve got loads of plans were going to support it massively
936795 content packs new objects new game modes all of this stuff could be done what were basically waiting to see is what the demand is for
936796 we can do all of that stuff we will do all of that stuff but what order we do it in and how much weight we throw behind any of the different ideas that different people have got is totally down to what the community does
936797 that really excites me because if people are loving the costumes we can crank them out if people are loving the levels and master classes weve got a slightly scarily long list of great ideas for ways to support the community and its just a matter of prioritising at this stage
936798 i can definitely say that there will be content thats available to people free of charge im just not saying exactly what that content is going to be right now
936799 i can also say that if theres any way we can reward the community well go there if people are clamouring for big chunks of content it would make total sense for us to do it were just exploring all options at this point sequels why not dlc yeah why not paid for content why not
936800 didnt he just say sending emails requesting links doesnt work
936801 t3 entertainment is searching for creative minds to passionately continue development of hellgate london and mythos along with other new games which are being published by hanbitsoft inc
936802 a development studio has been established in san francisco ca with hopes of gathering those who wish to join us in starting a new chapter of history in the game industry
936803 i really want to be able to do another game developer conference 2007 reveal a lot of people say to me that when we first did that sony gdc reveal of littlebigplanet that was a big shock people didnt see it coming i want to do another littlebigplanet reveal that people dont see coming
936804 its still littlebigplanet but people will be saying i thought it was this now youre telling me its this as well that excites me hugely
936805 i would love there to be a littlebigplanet universe of content with a game like this the number of directions and the breadth that you could take in while keeping it in a self contained universe is insane
936806 the big thing thing there is that weve got into a real habit of throwing stuff out earlier testing it and showing it earlier
936807 a lot of people ask when will littlebigplanet be done for gods sake this is the quickest game ive ever worked on to me this is an in and out job done sort of thing
936808 i think the reason is because we showed it when it was less than a year old if you go around and ask developers working on a new platform with a new ip whether theyd show it when it was less than a year old those people would be like fu off
936809 weve got used to this idea of really baring our soul to everyone as much as possible
936810 we havent changed the direction of the development were making the ps3 version first and then porting to the 360 later
936811 im telling the development team to not think about the xbox 360 right now we can think about it after the development kits arrive
936812 i can pretty much guarantee to you that if bioshock wasnt successful there never would have been another game like this
936813 i dont even know how we convinced people to pay for bioshock these games had never made any money everybody told us when we were pitching bioshock sounds like a great idea youll sell 150 000 units next
936814 honestly really deep down we wanted to popularise this kind of gameplay that weve been attached to for so long
936815 if the first iteration of it was a tiny bit simpler than system shock 2 look how many of these type of games do you think are going to be made now compared to how many were going to be made before it took us how many years to get this game green lit
936816 now future games competitors games our games we can build upon millions of peoples knowledge of the genre how many people had played these kind of games before 300 000 400 000 maybe now millions of people because of this game have played this type of game
936817 go back and play dune 2 and now look at them
936818 they have build queues all the complexity that you can have in games like company of heroes with cover and stuff like that its because a system was popularised and people were willing to invest in it with confidence that there was going to be an audience
936819 i could not have imagined being a missionary only 15 20 years ago without e mail or the internet
936820 if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness

936822 ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils ye cannot be partakers of the lords table and of the table of devils
936823 for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols
936824 take heed therefore that the light which is in there be not darkness if thy whole body therefore be full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light
936825 and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noonday
936826 i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life
936827 light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil but he that doeth truth cometh to the light

936846 i would like to apologise to both the parents and family of heidi murphy for what i have done which caused her death
936847 my intention was only to steal because i was pushed by economic needs and the result of that burglary was meant to buy a ring and to fund my marriage
936848 i did that because both of my parents could not afford to give me this and i didnt expect at all that the incident would be something like this
936849 by gods name i didnt have any intention to do this
936850 in this criminal case the defendant clearly had no intention and purpose to kill so that sentence demanded by the prosecutor is unacceptable
936851 i admit to all my mistakes and i realise that my action has violated law which the consequence is jail for me
936852 i surrender mr judge even though it feels so heavy the punishment that i must bear because im aware that this is definitely not as sad as has been felt by both parents and the family of heidi murphy for losing the person they loved
936853 im also aware that my action has tainted and slander bali image as tourist destination
936854 please honorary judges consider being a little bit more lenient with me so that i can have the chance to improve my life and so that i can do good deeds to others for now and for the future
936855 i also beg and ask for the greatest forgiveness from the parents and family of heidi murphy who have lost their most loving daughter
936856 i also offer an apology to my own parents for causing this very deep pain
936857 i didnt know anything about the murder i only knew about the burglary

936864 we are sending out requests today to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games

936866 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game

936869 interrogators propose to patients directly and openly to collaborate and or provide them with information on an ongoing basis
936870 has established control over a patient permitting medical treatment is explicitly or implicitly made contingent upon collaboration
936871 there is no conditioning whatsoever between receiving an entry permit to israel for humanitarian purposes and the willingness of that individual to provide information of any sort aside from about his medical condition
936872 it is not a new method for the zionist occupation
936873 the situation is worsened when parents from rich families want to have their children exempted from some regulations which causes serious tensions with teachers and may lead to a communication breakdown
936874 most of the teachers openly told us that if they got a leak of the national exam they would not hesitate to give to their students as their promotion and status in society is pegged on their performance in the kenya certificate of secondary education kcse
936875 society should stop branding all students who fail to score highly in kcse as absolute failures it is not the end of the world as there are many technical courses that are still marketable
936876 im not conducting a royal commission into air safety in this country she said
936877 it was evident or should have been evident to the air traffic controllers that this aircraft wasnt in the position the pilot believed it to be when he commenced his descent in cloud to land at a country airport he said
936878 its very important that we put more pressure on the lra despite the stalling of the peace talks

936880 higher oil prices and the lack of adequate fiscal policy reactions amidst high pent up price pressures are putting the burden of macro economic adjustment on the monetary authorities
936881 as a result policy as well as market interest rates could rise and a sharp deceleration in growth may follow
936882 greater government borrowing needs while not leading to a material deterioration of its key credit metrics would likely prevent an improvement in the remainder of fy08 09 contrary to our earlier expectation
936883 while moodys overall assessment is that the current constellation of risks is captured in the prevailing stable outlook downside pressures could emerge
936884 firstly they could involve deteriorations in the governments general debt metrics and its access to external liquidity given intensified commodity price shocks and an inadequate fiscal response
936885 secondly such pressures could be due to the rising risk of fiscal spillovers to indias external accounts such spillovers if large enough could weaken the case for the two notch gap between its foreign currency and local currency ratings

936895 weve of course looked all around the world but what struck us about new zealand was its rich mineral province which has been given a wide berth by many companies because of its strong social and environmental lobby groups
936896 we happen to be a very strong socially and environmentally responsible company and when we speak to these strong lobby groups we dont see any problems
936897 once youve absorbed that challenge you start to look at the hard mineralogy and see something that is akin to the pilbara five years ago where there are massive mineral occupancies basically unpegged where people simply dont have the faith to get in there and build infrastructure and develop those known and in many cases proved mineral resources

936920 we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known i refer to the federal reserve board this evil institution has impoverished the people of the united states and has practically bankrupted our government it has done this through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it
936921 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set the government at defiance the issuing power of money should be taken away from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
936922 history records that the money changers have used every form of abuse intrigue deceit and violent means possible to maintain their control over governments by controlling money and its issuance
936923 most americans have no real understanding of the operation of the international money lenders the accounts of the federal reserve system have never been audited it operates outside the control of congress and manipulates the credit of the united states
936924 here lies america the greatest nation that might have been had it not been for the edomite bankers who first stole their money used their stolen money to buy their politicians and press and lastly deprived them of their constitutional freedom by the most evil device yet created the federal reserve banking system

936947 the conservatism that speaks to us through its actions in washington is institutionally opposed to those baseline good intentions we learned about in elementary school its leaders laugh off the idea of the public interest as airy fairy nonsense they caution against bringing top notch talent into government service they declare war on public workers they have made a cult of outsourcing and privatizing they have wrecked establishment federal operations because they disagree with them and they have deliberately piled up an everest of debt in order to force the government into crisis the ruination they have wrought has been thorough it has been a professional job repairing it will require years of political action

936980 there is this belief that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life

937035 drivers across the country can fight rising gas prices by simply maintaining proper tire inflation tires that are underinflated by just six to seven psi can reduce vehicle fuel economy by as much as 2 percent and tire tread wear can also be reduced by as much as ten percent
937036 tire experts speculate that 2 8 billion gallons of gas are wasted annually by u s drivers simply because theyre driving on underinflated tires
937037 in addition that same 2 8 billion gallons wasted result into 56 billion pounds of carbon dioxide released into the environment
937038 we can all help prevent this by making sure our tires are properly inflated

937060 if all that is needed is that the house value is less than the mortgage value there is a large number of homeowners in the united states who are in that situation
937061 i would say its probably 70 of the volume of our foreclosures right now
937062 its a business decision for their family that the smartest thing they can do is walk away from their home
937063 the losses for the financial system from people walking away could be of the order of one trillion dollars when the entire capital of the us banking system is only 1 3 trillion
937064 you could have most of the us banking system wiped out so this is a total disaster
937065 hundreds of thousands of people in the uk have jobs in sectors where tipping is commonplace
937066 when people leave a tip in a restaurant or elsewhere they expect it to go to service staff and as consumers weve got a right to know if that actually happens
937067 this is an issue of fairness and common sense and its one many people clearly care a lot about
937068 waiters and waitresses across the country have been hungry for the tips loophole to be closed and the announcement today will satisfy their appetites
937069 it is great news that unscrupulous employers will no longer be able to use the tips left for staff to subsidise low wages
937070 the government is right to make sure that workers can keep their tips and that the responsibility to pay the minimum wage rests squarely with employers
937071 this is a welcome example of the government responding to the concerns of hard pressed vulnerable workers
937072 far too many rogue employers have been using tips to make up the national minimum wage
937073 interrogators propose to patients directly and openly to collaborate and or provide them with information on an ongoing basis
937074 has established control over a patient permitting medical treatment is explicitly or implicitly made contingent upon collaboration
937075 there is no conditioning whatsoever between receiving an entry permit to israel for humanitarian purposes and the willingness of that individual to provide information of any sort aside from about his medical condition
937076 it is not a new method for the zionist occupation
937077 we warn citizens not to succumb to these temptations and to report to the authorities
937078 the big idea being bandied around at the moment is the reality tv show it would be based on tv talent show searches like the bbc did to find an actress to play maria in the sound of music
937079 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time

937445 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
937446 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
937447 they celebrate thrill seeking and instant gratification without ever allowing any thought of responsibility towards others

937468 if a whole province such as the episcopal church acts contrary to gods word and the consensus of the communion who in the anglican communion has the authority to discipline that erring province
937469 so when the archbishop of canterbury invited these american bishops to participate in the lambeth conference against the recommendations of the windsor report and the primates meeting and in the face of the unrelenting commitment of the american church to bless sinful behaviour we were stunned
937470 over the past five years we have come to see this as a remnant of british colonialism and it is not serving us well the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government
937471 st francis of assisi said preach the gospel at all times when necessary use words we believe that our absence at this lambeth conference is the only way that our voice will be heard for more than ten years we have been speaking and have not been heard so maybe our absence will speak louder than our words
937472 uganda has a superior icc ranking so it is an honor for us to test ourselves with them
937473 nevermind lah thats the fate of politicians up and down whats important is what you do before you leave
937474 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
937475 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
937476 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties
937477 the uk and other economies in europe which had enjoyed have also weakened the decline in credit availability is accelerating this process
937478 ik wist van niets over de afspraak tussen standard en de voetbalbond
937479 ik heb dat gelezen en gehoord maar officieel ben ik hier niet van op de hoogte
937480 niemand van de voetbalbond heeft me hierover opgebeld ik had gehoopt om fellaini foto ook tegen china te kunnen gebruiken bovendien voelt marouane zich hier heel goed
937481 zegt de bondsvoorzitter dat ik wel een oplossing zal vinden als fellaini weg is tja ik heb geen andere keuze zeker zoals gewoonlijk mag ik het weer oplossen
937482 ik onderga deze beslissing gewoon ik bekijk het wel van dag tot dag
937483 sindsdien praten verschillende leden van de technische staf op hem in
937484 over de invulling van de basisploeg is nog niets beslist dat is hem duidelijk gemaakt ik zal iedereen nodig hebben en maak hier geen drama van

937487 these data do not provide sufficient information to address questions of severity and impairment that might explain such complex drug regimens
937488 there are serious behavioral and emotional problems with many foster children and we want to make sure they are medicated appropriately these are our troubled children
937489 in u s youth across the country this increase in psychotropic drug use represents a sea change in the practice of child mental health treatment since 1990 such trends in community treatment deserve further investigation lets learn more about the medications being taken by children the reasons for use who benefits and who doesnt
937490 so we are generalizing our knowledge from adults to children without knowing enough about pharmacokinetics dosing or long term safety in the pediatric population
937491 this is a post marketing view of how a drug is doing
937492 the future of nashville is under construction now future generations have to live with what we as developers create that places a heavy responsibility on us to be excellent to only be involved in quality developments alex s palmer amp company is totally committed to developing space that is as functional and aesthetic as we can possibly make it for out time and for the future
937493 we continue to move forward with logistics amp planning for this exciting project
937494 the compactrio embedded system and labview graphical tools from national instruments gave us the power to design prototype and deploy the control system within our visica2 medical device quickly and beat our time to market goals while saving money by eliminating the need for building custom hardware the rio architecture and new low cost hardware help us even further by allowing us to quickly move to lower cost hardware when deploying our machines at high volume without having to redesign software or start over from scratch with a new design
937495 we were able to rapidly prototype our system for fedex using labview and compactrio and create a final deployed solution with ni single board rio all in under a year the fact that ni provides hardware and software to quickly prototype and deploy embedded systems was crucial for us were quite sure we wouldnt have been able to hit our aggressive deadlines without ni tools
937496 i am following this great sporting event the most important and anticipated on the world level with great fondness

937500 we gave the residents of hakibaale one year so that they could harvest all their crops and leave the reserve land but in vain
937501 the eu has indicated that they are not willing to put more money in the project they are willing to have salinis contract terminated because the firm has continued to demonstrate inability to finish the road project such that its open for public use
937502 we have to take a decision quickly the public desires that this contract be terminated we dont need irreversible decisions like the laying of asphalt
937503 we are completely disturbed on the northern bypass i hope we shall not be forced to kick out the contractor
937504 youre wrong the eu cannot reject the road and whoever told you that doesnt have facts right we are experts and we know what we are doing
937505 we are going to finish off this country if we dont go slow on selling government land
937506 land appreciates in value everyday and if the minister thinks that shs476 6 billion is not enough for defence he should bring a supplementary budget but not to sell this hospital under the guise of under funding whether cabinet has approved or not thats their problem but for us we see no sense in selling off this facility because we need it
937507 in order to facilitate faster development of infrastructure for the army mainly in the area of barracks and healthcare cabinet has authorised the sale of land in lower mbuya kitante courts and kisekka hospital
937508 we had the idea already but the cabinet hadnt cleared the process now that this process was cleared we are going to sell off this facility because to us it is no longer fit to be a hospital
937509 in order to stop armed cattle theft we agreed to protect the border of the country that is the reason for training these 167 special police constables
937510 eight suspects were arrested with 75 cattle eye tags and 70 cows were recovered the cattle were stolen from zziwa ranchers and royal ranches in luweero and masindi districts respectively
937511 we have always had trouble with kinyara especially when we start with them this time however we are very fit as we have been involved in pre season competition

937514 its been quite long since we tasted olympic glory however a after keen look at the team in beijing i think kipsiro and chepkirwok should do well
937515 i cant say they will win medals but they are the best we have for chepkirwok he has to first negotiate the preliminary races and if he gets to the final anything can happen
937516 i havent watched kipsiro competing lately but he is well rested and has the necessary experience if we are to get a medal it will definitely come from him or chepkirwok
937517 tell the archbishop to take care of the diocese thank the people of mombasa for allowing me to stay here
937518 the fisheries staff and the beach management units at the landing sites have found it difficult to crack down on illegal fishing gear because politicians shield culpable fishermen
937519 the government give recommended nets to fishermen on short term loans when the nets are burnt by fisheries officers redundant fishermen could become a threat to the society
937520 ik ga nu volop genieten al ben ik stiekem blij dat ik voorlopig geen enkel zwangerschapskwaaltje heb en ik voel het gewoon dit wordt een keicoole baby
937521 we recognise that all human beings have the right to the preservation of life religion property intellect and dignity no muslim or christian should deny the other these rights nor should they tolerate the denigration or desecration of one anothers sacred symbols founding figures or places of worship
937522 denounce and deplore threats made against those who engage in inter faith dialogue
937523 i t is a legitimate means of expression and an essential tool in the quest for the common good
937524 while we must reflect the global stock market as it is we must also recognize the rapid rise of companies in countries such as india
937525 we have already seen great indian companies acquiring famous brands such as jaguar and land rover but these developments are just the beginning of a long term trend that will fundamentally change the international corporate landscape
937526 and for me its about maintaining my approach and letting the results take care of themselves
937527 thats a good question but i dont have a choice
937528 weve got to get on a plane and weve got to go play kansas city its not a matter of if i want to leave here or not we have to
937529 again hes given us a lot of production in a limited situation hes gotten some big hits some timely hits and hes blended in well mixed in with the veterans and hes helped us win
937530 obviously billy muellers a great hitter because hes a guy who won the al batting title
937531 but the guy i grew up watching was carlos guillen when he was with the mariners now with detroit but any time you can get compared with a guy whos won the batting title its flattering
937532 he was a switch hitting shortstop i mean thats pretty much it i always respected the way he approached a game was a patient hitter and just got the job done
937533 then i saw the ball was carrying and got over gonzalezs head and i just kept running
937534 im not saying that they made the wrong call by playing me in but i hit the ball well and got a triple out of it got it over his head
937535 ive always been taught to hit it where its pitched
937536 and when im swinging the bat well thats what im doing
937537 any opportunity you get up here no matter if its short or long you want to show people what you can do
937538 i didnt show up and say this is my time i just came with the same approach that ive had my whole career for me as long as i take care of my approach then the results will be there in the end
937539 it was obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit on this flight
937540 on the plus side the flight of our first stage with the new merlin 1c engine that will be used in falcon 9 was picture perfect unfortunately a problem occurred with stage separation causing the stages to be held together this is under investigation and i will send out a note as soon as we understand exactly what happened
937541 theres an interesting line building on obama that somehow success and intelligence are a handicap
937542 biggest challenger may not be republican john mccain but rather his own hubris
937543 not commander in chief just yet which is why some find his decision to start planning his transition into the white house a bit presumptuous
937544 theres an interesting line building on obama that somehow success and intelligence are a handicap

937546 pc tools is a global leader in innovative software products designed to protect the privacy and security of windows computer users
937547 athletes from marathoners to dieters are joining introplay to train together and accomplish their goals we regard everyone as an athlete because sustained physical activity is crucial to improving conditioning and health everyone benefits from the diversity of the introplay network
937548 with 95 of our active players tracking multiple sports and activities we see a clear need to provide a universal training experience to athletes
937549 introplays dynamic services and community have really added an extra edge to my training i see how my workouts motivate other players and that makes me push even harder
937550 that doesnt come from marketing it comes from subject matter experts why brands need a new kind of leader
937551 we have kind of a backlog with the maintenance of our aircraft

937556 backdrop of serious threat posed by terrorism to security and stability of afghanistan india and the region
937557 the attack on our embassy in kabul on july 7 has tragically shown that terrorism has no barriers and is not bound by restraints
937558 it was an attack on the friendship between india and afghanistan

937563 modern corporate mythology has the unique decision maker as hero we adhere to the view that the many are smarter than the few and solicit a broad base of views before reaching any decision
937564 building a consensus sometimes takes longer but always produces a more committed team and better decisions
937565 fear of rejection is a natural reaction of people who meet for the first time it can lead to some apparently irrational behaviours triggered by primal defence mechanisms
937566 simple activities such as walking in the forest or in the countryside are just as good at this early stage singing exercises theatre acting or drum playing exercises have also proved to be very effective with teams
937567 they are meant to allow the team members to focus safely on the work at hand and to avoid energy wasting frustrations team norms set the boundaries for what is expected behaviour and what is unacceptable behaviour
937568 authorisation which occurs after authentication or login is the last major mechanism that protects sensitive resources from access by underprivileged users
937569 guessing a weak password is bad enough but things get a lot worse when we discover that the lowly user account we just compromised can mount a share containing sensitive corporate financial data
937570 some of the most damaging attacks we have seen and heard of do not involve technology at all
937571 so called social engineering uses human to human trickery and misdirection to gain unauthorised access to data
937572 how could that be possible in an age in which were all so dependent on electronic transmissions to communicate quickly effectively and accurately with our co workers banning email is almost like prohibiting the use of calculators in favour of fingers and toes
937573 what can be worse than absent signal for your cell phone
937574 at onecommand we are all about communication and as this event is right in our backyard near our offices in costa mesa it made a lot of sense to participate the waai does a wonderful job with these events and having an opportunity for open dialogue with other industry influencers is especially valuable in todays market its also a tremendous amount of fun
937575 we are delighted to have onecommand step up and help with this sponsorship as they are such a great fit

937582 know the miseries of women in her community first hand
937583 muslim women are some of the worst victims of domestic violence and marital abuse
937584 often women are never allowed to tell their side of the story
937585 because of widespread illiteracy women are simply not aware of the rights that islam has provided them with
937586 divorce for instance is a long drawn out process yet the practice of triple talaq where men can divorce their wives by pronouncing talaq at one go has ruined the lives of many women who have been left by their husbands sometimes for the flimsiest of reasons like putting extra salt in the food
937587 all we have done is to explain everything in the light of the quran rather than leave things to be arbitrarily decided by men
937588 the contract was drawn up in consultation with the clergy and we are against that
937589 we want to keep the clergy out because of their rigidity
937590 makes hundreds of internet based education resources supported by agencies across the u s federal government easier to find
937591 we cannot live for ourselves alone our lives are connected by a thousand invisible threads and along these sympathetic fibers our actions run as causes and return to us as results
937592 this success opens a huge market potential for bhel not only in the hydro segment but also in the thermal and gas based power plants segments in vietnam which will witness huge capacity additions in the future
937593 i had contact with force india team principal colin kolles the first point for me was this is an indian team the indian flag normally im not so patriotic as they say wherever i lay your hat its my home and my home is actually germany but i was born in india

937600 being a medium sized bank the bank needs to scale up business faster to gain size for that the bank urgently needs capital
937601 weve been servicing the florida community for over 20 years
937602 were not looking to change how we do business instead were thrilled about the opportunity to expand our service capabilities to our valued customers
937603 our evolution into global employment solutions was necessary to increase brand awareness and accommodate our rapidly expanding service offerings
937604 we acquired southeastern companies back in 1998 and chose to continue operating the peo division as southeastern companies changing the name now not only affords us the freedom to expand into any global market but our customers benefit from globals wide range human resource service offerings including staffing consulting employee leasing peo and executive search
937605 our company has the advantage of intimately knowing the industry and our customers explicit needs

937607 in the long run we expect such parks to be highly beneficial to our growth and the whole logistical sector so as an organisation we will definitely like to participate in it
937608 though 11 areas have been initially identified for setting up multi modal logistics parks the railways may increase it to potential sites for upcoming special economic zones

937610 our year to date bpo revenue grew 11 4 percent and our year to date operating margin excluding unusual items increased to 9 6 percent we continue to perform well in a dynamic global economy and our leading industry position enabled us to win an estimated 65 million in annualized new business during the second quarter of 2008 we believe the third quarter of 2008 will again represent a strong level of new business wins based on the size and number of deals we are currently working to complete

937617 till the new crop comes whatever restrictions are there they will stay in place possibly by end of november or so after the rice crop we will know what is the position
937618 the surge in exports can mainly be attributed to the incentives given by the commerce ministry which helped exporters offset to some extent the rise in inland and overseas transport costs
937619 they the consequences will fall disproportionately on those who are most vulnerable in the global economy those who needed the chances the opportunities most from a successful trade round
937620 farmers got rs 2 500 3 000 per quintal of pusa 1121 last year compared to rs 1 200 1 500 per quintal in the previous year because of the sudden pick up observed in its demand in the export market especially in the middle east countries
937621 this variety brought an earning of rs 45 000 per acre to farmers which is quite a substantial amount for a farmer
937622 the japanese trade union confederation jtuc representing 6 8 million organised working people in japan is delivering this letter to protest at the charges levelled against leaders of zctu president lovemore matombo and secretary general wellington chibebe
937623 the two men have repeatedly been targeted and brutalized in the past for engaging in legitimate trade union activities as have other union activists
937624 as such jtuc is joining the ituc in demanding you drop all the charges against the zctu leadership and end the violence against trade unionists and all other civilians without further delay
937625 the labour situation and the situation in general of zimbabwe is of great concern to us and the world at large
937626 we follow it and there has been continued violence against members of the labour movement as well as people of dissenting views especially during the just ended one man election run off
937627 international labour bodies and the world must help each other to restore normalcy in zimbabwe
937628 we have since petitioned the zimbabwean government to drop the charges we will continue to engage other movements in other countries together with the international body ituc to pile up pressure on mugabe to stop the harassment of trade unionists
937629 again we could not discuss the matter with our clients because the state did not serve us with their papers on time they only gave us the papers on tuesday
937630 its a setback but we will let the panels to decide on whatever measures they wanted to take to address this recent development anyway they are scheduled to meet tomorrow they are supposed to sign the memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain so we will let them decide on what other measures they will take up to be able to counter this development
937631 well you could just imagine that they are supposed to sign the moa on ancestral domain foreign dignataries are already in malaysia hundreds of civil society ngos and even international communities organizations are already in malaysia hindi ko ma quantify ito kung gaano kalalim kung gaano kalawak but definitely this is a setback
937632 no official of this land can just decide for their people without due consultations
937633 we won the battle but because this is just a tro therefore our victory is just temporary
937634 weve decided in 2001 we said no to the inclusion in the expanded armm why include the province again in 2009 plebiscite i just could not understand that
937635 the protest move tomorrow will be our chances of getting our peoples abreast on the issues we will know their positions on the issues that affect their lives
937636 rage when the government decided to sell or surrender the countrys sovereign to a rebel group
937637 when a city is sinking into the sea and rioting runs rampant government should saddle up
937638 pro free market ideas for responding to hurricane katrina and high gas prices

937644 they will investigate the propriety of actions of the justices in the decisions of the court of appeals and also the allegations of the attempt to bribe a justice of the court of appeals
937645 this is a conclusion i feel compelled to reach and i do so most reluctantly
937646 conclusion is inevitable given the wording of the act it is however a highly regrettable conclusion for the tax payers of the london borough of wandsworth
937647 those taxpayers not it seems the government in whitehall must now fund a payment of over 100 times the value of the land under legislation which should have been amended through the initiative of the relevant department in whitehall in accordance with the recommendations of the law commission and the observations of lord oliver
937648 the recommendation of the law commission might on one view have been seen as something of a tidying up provision the law commission was not faced with and did not set out the possibly dire consequences of this legislation which are demonstrated in practice in this case that may be why the recommendation has not been acted on but another very weighty authority has also urged the review of these provisions lord oliver speaking for a unanimous house of lords described the provisions as an anachronistic relic and urged their reconsideration that was fifteen years ago lord olivers call has not been heeded
937649 must exert political pressure to achieve the correction of the anomaly
937650 all three judges have recognised that this is a deeply unsatisfactory outcome for tax payers who will now have to pay a firm of property developers compensation worth more than 50 times what they originally paid for it and more than 100 times its current market value
937651 this could all have been avoided civil servants and ministers have been warned on numerous occasions that this piece of legislation was a ticking timebomb that should be ditched but they have done nothing and local residents will now have to pay the price for their inaction
937652 ive got about a dozen and theyre like gold dust to me if im at screaming point then i will take a couple

937655 the truth is that in the uk for the past 10 years or more somewhere between 200 and 300 people have been dying every year from accidental ingestion perhaps from overdose many of them old or confused or vulnerable young people often people who werent actually prescribed the drug at all and thats the target of this change
937656 we have always accepted that some patients will need co proxamol and that is why supplies are being assured
937657 the doctor has to make a judgement that using the drug is in the patients best interests
937658 we need to get the message out there that heart attacks on the silver screen and tv arent what people usually experience
937659 there are so many symptoms the thing is if you are feeling very unwell not like yourself and you have that little suspicion this doubt in your mind that you are maybe having a heart attack dont delay call 999
937660 i was really surprised to find out id had a heart attack because they always show people on television shows like coronation street keeling over but my experience wasnt anything like that
937661 i just had a tight feeling across my chest and some pain up my arms but fortunately i got help in time
937662 its a little too early to tell how safe they the walk in clinics are but there is a big incentive for them to work on the safe side and follow very strict protocols for most things
937663 there is a concern that clinics will increase the fragmentation of care that youll get a little bit here a little bit there and no one will have a whole picture of your health and something could fall through the cracks

937669 obamas policies abroad are very much in the mode of liberal interventionism resembling the polices of say madeleine albright or richard holbrooke
937670 but there is a strong similarity with exponents of mccains conservative nationalism adhered to by donald rumsfeld dick cheney condoleezza rice and george bush himself
937671 its merely a question of tone and nuance liberal interventionists dont like to openly discuss the military option and prefer to talk about using diplomacy against their enemies
937672 obama is rhetorically different to bush but you would expect than that in opposition in effect his policies on iran iraq and israel are almost entirely the same
937673 military action is definitely not off limits against some countries
937674 this new institution will be led by america it will be unlikely to intervene in those countries which are friendly to the usa irrespective of their human rights record

937822 although financial stocks rallied sharply during mid july we believe the gains will be short lived we expect that the negative effects of continued home price declines and contracting credit will lead to a decline in consumer spending and in turn a decline in u s gdp
937823 as the economy weakens we expect credit costs will continue to rise resulting in weaker financial earnings the need for additional capital and lower stock prices for financials

937841 it just comes in on certain cuts it comes in
937842 i can tell myself a million times run to the left run to the right dont think about my leg but until you actually go out there repetition is just the best way to handle it
937843 ill go over and just keep going through the same play just to get it out of my mind where im running and reacting and not thinking about it
937844 you have to exercise your mind when you are injured because the mind is a powerful force
937845 its up to you mentally to prepare yourself and say look the doctor went in and did the surgery and mended up whatever was injured so ive got to go out there and dont think about it
937846 i think you got to get into a game and you got to feel it
937847 all of these things when youre coming off an acl youre not going to get those answers until you get into a game we got to get into a game and im sure ronnies anxious but were bringing him pretty close out here in practice and i know hes starting to feel a little bit better about himself
937848 being in situations where there is some contact just going through drills where im running the ball and all that where i do have that contact i think that is going to help me to get over the mental part of it not being hit since what week 7
937849 i put all the physical work in going through rehab and all of that but when i can go out there and not think about it thats when it will all come together
937850 that old saying how you always kill the one you love well look it works both ways with a gun stuck in your mouth and the barrel of the gun between your teeth you can only talk in vowels tyler and me at the edge of the roof the gun in my mouth im wondering how clean this gun is
937851 because im tyler durden and you can kiss my ass i register to fight every guy in the club that night fifty fights one fight at a time no shoes no shirts
937852 my mentality going into every single practice whoever im going against is i feel as if nobody can cover me if you dont have that mentality then youre already setting yourself up for failure
937853 he went one on one with a safety for us thats a pretty good matchup when youve got dustin keller running down the middle of the field i just threw that to an area and let him go get it he did a great job
937854 ive just been seeing him make plays thats all ive been seeing
937855 i think that the play that he scored on is a really good look on how a tight end can affect the defense
937856 deep down the middle of the field he gets over the top catches it you miss one tackle and he goes the distance
937857 that puts a lot of pressure on defenses because they have to make a decision as to how much coverage do you want to push outside the receivers and how wide open do you want to leave that middle corridor its a stretch on opposing defenses
937858 if theyre overplaying i think i can do a lot of stuff underneath i just feel a lot more comfortable with the offense now i thought i was a pretty good receiving tight end in college but coming here and talking to the coaches and having them coaching me up on a whole bunch of different things has definitely opened my eyes up to a ton of different things
937859 i think about that every day and i say im glad im not a first round pick because that would be a whole bunch of pressure
937860 not that its not a lot of pressure them just drafting me no matter what round because they believe that you can play i just have to work hard to show them that i was worth that pick

937868 nel distretto di thyolo in malawi un infermiere mantiene 400 pazienti in vita supervisionando cure essenziali ma il suo salario di base di 3 dollari al giorno
937869 e intollerabile sentirsi poi dire dai governi e dai paesi donatori che aumentare il suo salario insostenibile nonostante lei sia responsabile per 7500 dollari di farmaci per i suoi pazienti ogni mese coloro che vogliono sostenere i finanziamenti per i farmaci devono trovare il modo di coprire i costi ricorrenti come i salari per gli operatori sanitari
937870 davvero deprimente vedere le persone che diventano sempre pi malate e a volte morire perch devono attendere settimane o mesi per essere curate poich manca il personale
937871 il personale sovraccaricato sotto pagato e sottovalutato sempre pi raro nellafrica sub sahariana mentre il numero dei pazienti non fa che aumentare i farmaci antiretrovirali sono forse pi disponibili nelle farmacie degli ospedali e delle cliniche ma senza il personale per somministrarli il problema dellaccesso alle cure per i malati non verr risolto

937899 i would like to apologise to both the parents and family of heidi murphy for what i have done which caused her death
937900 my intention was only to steal because i was pushed by economic needs and the result of that burglary was meant to buy a ring and to fund my marriage
937901 i did that because both of my parents could not afford to give me this and i didnt expect at all that the incident would be something like this
937902 by gods name i didnt have any intention to do this
937903 in this criminal case the defendant clearly had no intention and purpose to kill so that sentence demanded by the prosecutor is unacceptable
937904 i admit to all my mistakes and i realise that my action has violated law which the consequence is jail for me
937905 i surrender mr judge even though it feels so heavy the punishment that i must bear because im aware that this is definitely not as sad as has been felt by both parents and the family of heidi murphy for losing the person they loved
937906 im also aware that my action has tainted and slander bali image as tourist destination
937907 please honorary judges consider being a little bit more lenient with me so that i can have the chance to improve my life and so that i can do good deeds to others for now and for the future
937908 i also beg and ask for the greatest forgiveness from the parents and family of heidi murphy who have lost their most loving daughter
937909 i also offer an apology to my own parents for causing this very deep pain
937910 i didnt know anything about the murder i only knew about the burglary

937934 a theorist who maintains of something that is not obviously impossible that nonetheless that thing is impossible owes us an argument
937935 needs a positive argument in favor of the compatibility thesis
937936 necessarily if determinism is true then there is no freedom
937937 in general a certain burden of proof lies on those who claim that a certain description is logically impossible if no reasonable analysis of the terms in question points towards a contradiction or even makes the existence of a contradiction plausible then there is a natural assumption in favor of logical possibility
937938 the basic incompatibilist intuition that determinism is incompatible with freedom has such power for us is as much a natural fact about cogitative beings like ourselves as is the fact of our quite unreflective commitment to the reactive attitudes what is more the roots of the incompatibilist intuition lie deep in the very reactive attitudes that are invoked in order to undercut it the reactive attitudes enshrine the incompatibilist intuition
937939 dialectical stalemate as we say it may not help or work to consult the folk in these more complex cases
937940 a theorist who maintains of something that is not obviously impossible that nonetheless that thing is impossible owes us an argument
937941 letting w stand for the collection of all physically possible worlds that is possible worlds which satisfy the natural laws obtaining in the actual world we can define the laplacian variety of determinism as follows the world w in w is laplacian deterministic just in case for any w in w if w and w agree at any time then they agree for all times
937942 the absence of libertarian free will is a moral tragedy
937943 we do not have good evidence that compatibilism is true
937944 even with swambatle i think you begin your investigation assuming its compatible with any other possible proposition including determinism
937945 but the compatibilist it seems can use this argument to suggest that the libertarian conception of free will the one required for both libertarians and skeptics arguments to go through has metaphysical commitments that go beyond the compatibilists and without good reason for accepting such a conception it sets the bar for just retributive practices beyond what we could plausibly gain evidence to get over
937946 but then compatibilism also belongs to another cross cutting category the category of comfortable reassuring depictions of ourselves
937947 as human beings we have a tremendous emotional attachment to the idea that we have free will if philosophers did not share in this emotional attachment if they did not come at the issue already hoping in their heart of hearts for things to be a certain way how many would still take a realist stance towards free will i doubt that many would to me that speaks volumes about which position is more likely to be correct
937948 on our view if t1 and t2 are both theories of x then to say that t1 is more metaphysically demanding than t2 is to say that t1 requires more metaphysical theses to be true than t2 does in order for there to be any xs likewise incompatibilists whether libertarians or skeptics have more metaphysically demanding theories than compatibilists since they say that special kinds of causation indeterministic or agent causation must obtain if there are any free actions
937949 the incompatibilist both libertarian and skeptic require that the world be a certain very specific way for us to have free will that goes beyond the way the compatibilist requires the world to be on the assumption that incompatibilist theories tend to require the basic compatibilist requirements as well
937950 on our view if t1 and t2 are both theories of x then to say that t1 is more metaphysically demanding than t2 is to say that t1 requires more metaphysical theses to be true than t2 does in order for there to be any xs
937951 these libertarian conceptions demand more of the world in order for free will to exist
937952 the fact that one can form a grammatical english sentence asserting something does not constitute and argument for its possiblity
937953 if my goal is to straightforwardly convert tomkow to incompatibilism i will have to accept the burden he places on the incompatiblist in his post above
937954 if my goal is simply to understand the concepts of freedom determinism and responsibility then i see no need to refute tomkows t and with all due respect to lycan and others they dont get to legislate this for me
937955 sartre is a free will realist who finds this fact the occasion for much anguish
937956 i meant to comment on your characterization of moral responsibility as retribution which in turn is described as suffering imposed for the sake of suffering thats too much consider for example rousseaus view on punishment its arguably retributive in a broad sense of that term in that its backward looking rather than consequentialist but it isnt about suffering imposed for the sake of suffering should we conclude that rousseau denies the existence of moral responsibility
937957 it is reasonable to demand that anything called moral responsibility not be purely forward looking and that the associated attitudes be a response to the agents acts anything much beyond that is tendentious
937958 you dont do the time if you didnt do the crime
937959 according to many compatibilists even if a person is determined to do something she is still able to decide not to do this thing of course she wont decide not to do it but she can thus before she commits a crime she is still able not to do so even if she firmly intends to commit the crime she is able to change her mind therefore she still has the opportunity to remain innocent
937960 the reason why we may punish at t0 is not predictability but that the crime in a sense is already there
937961 the crime obviously cannot already be there at t0 because it is going to be caused through the exercise of lfw only later
937962 the events in these cases occur in deterministic yet non chaotic worlds
937963 to be square at time t is to have four equal sides at right angles at time t
937964 to be square is to have four equal sides at right angles
937965 your reductive theory about the nature of squareness cant explain why there is something wrong today with putting those pegs into round holes
937966 the issue is not only what we may come to know but under which conditions we are morally permitted to prepunish on my account of a typical compatibilist situation the reason why we may punish at t0 is not predictability but that the crime in a sense is already there if a person has formed an intention to commit a crime and it is determined that this intention will later cause the crime in a non deviant way then we seem to have long before the crime is actually committed a punishable desert and responsibility for the crime and not only for the intention to cause the crime the passage of time is still required but merely for the crime to unfold as determined for a determinist even before the crime occurs nothing morally substantial may be missing in order for the punishment to be acceptable morally determinism seems to extend the already formed intention into complete causal efficacy and culpable responsibility for the crime even long before the crime takes place
937967 if it would be permissible to retributively punish john at t10 for what he did at t4 why would it not also be permissible to retributively punish him at t10 for what he is going to do at t11
937968 in certain situations a reasonable understanding of desert and responsibility can be satisfied for compatibilists even before the crime is actually committed
937969 i have to confess im a little confused by your example
937970 an individual s can only be justly punished for x if s is responsible for x
937971 deservingness is a property that traces backwards not forwards and it exists whether the universe is deterministic or indeterministic
937972 as smilansky suggests in the previous comment as a rule it doesnt make sense to punish a person when he hasnt a clue why he is being punished
937973 i think prepunishment is not always wrong not if the subject being prepunished knows that he will perform a specific crime and know he has no intention to act otherwise in these cases of course prepunishment can serve the expressive function
937974 a case where an agent deliberately blocks his epistemic access to his crimes is tricky
937975 an essential element of punishment is that it perform an expressive function that cannot be performed if the agent being punished doesnt have epistemic access to the crime
937976 well of course he shouldnt be punished he doesnt have epistemic access to the crime
937977 man can do what he wants but he cannot will what he wills
937978 once certain conditions are met there is nothing missing for compatibilists to be able to prepunish
937979 letting w stand for the collection of all physically possible worlds that is possible worlds which satisfy the natural laws obtaining in the actual world we can define the laplacian variety of determinism as follows the world w in w is laplacian deterministic just in case for any w in w if w and w agree at any time then they agree for all times

937985 we devised this day to help children gain an understanding of financial planning as early as possible its also much more than knowing how money works
937986 its about helping to inspire our young people to believe in a positive future for themselves and their families children learn more when they are enjoying themselves and the rap music they performed showed how they can relate the lessons to their home lives the day has been a lot of fun for everyone
937987 guessing how much stuff costs like food and drinks was good we learnt how to use and spend money wisely but also to work together as a team im quite good at maths i count up the coins that daddy saves and when he needs money i count it out but the day still helped having to work out maths problems in three minutes was difficult
937988 its the easiest thing to run up debt whatever your income is the key aim here is to pass on some of our knowledge about money and help young people understand that they shouldnt spend more than theyve got
937989 as a major financial institution i believe we should contribute to the health of the country as a nation we need to be more financially aware to avoid building high levels of debt especially in todays economic climate and this is one area where we can make a positive contribution

937991 the evidence is that these hips are being ordered and not being processed they are being suspended until such time as a buyer is found
937992 i dont think it is within the spirit of the regulations actually i dont think it is within the regulations
937993 there probably are some estate agents who are flouting the law but it is understandable in this absolutely catastrophically bad market
937994 we dont condone flouting the law but i can certainly understand why they are doing it especially as the pack is completely useless to buyer and seller
937995 i have never yet had a buyer ask to see a home information pack on a property they ignore it it is usually when the solicitor asks to see if there is a pack there that we provide it the pack is of no interest to buyers and is considered to be a stealth tax by sellers
937996 home sellers have to have commissioned a home information pack when they put their house on the market and after 28 days a hip must be purchased we introduced this flexibility to help home owners
937997 more than 700 000 homes now have energy ratings as a result of hips helping home owners save money on fuel bills and cut carbon emissions
937998 if you report for work on or after 1 november 2008 not having accepted this offer of re engagement you will be asked to leave the premises as you will no longer be an employee of leeds city council
937999 we have written to all members of staff involved in the first phase of the pay and grading project offering them new terms of employment and the majority have replied to say they have accepted
938000 however we are in the unfortunate position that for a very small number of staff who have not accepted this offer we have had to advise them of the need to begin dismissal and offer of immediate re engagement proceedings
938001 this is regretful but it is now the only remaining method of implementing the national single status agreement that will ensure the councils pay structure complies with equal pay legislation
938002 our members are not happy with that and they refused
938003 what we wanted them to do was lift the women up and what they have done is drag the men down
938004 there was a right way to do this and a wrong way and this was the wrong way
938005 it is absolutely extreme it is not unheard of but it is almost unheard of you might get a backstreet company doing this some low lives not a city council
938006 we think these people will be unfairly dismissed it is so unusual that our lawyers cannot give us an immediate response
938007 there are reasons you would accept to do this thing

938031 it is revealing that the mayors administration decided to break the news with a statement by an official spokesperson of transport for london matt brown on sunday in the venezuelan newspaper el universel rather than making any statement to londoners or the media in the capital
938032 boris johnsons ideologically motivated move to cut off technical assistance to venezuela will cost london a cool 7 million as well as doubling fares for some of the poorest people in the capital when energy prices are at their highest levels in history
938033 boris johnson talks about saving money but in reality he is already costing londoners a fortune
938034 it is remarkable that he did not even inform londoners that they will have to pay 7 million for his policy and instead leaked the news in latin america
938035 livingstone should have got his facts straight before attacking the mayor in the media
938036 the fact remains though that under the widely derided deal venezuela a very poor country has given london one of the worlds richest cities some 16m of which several million has not been used
938037 boris johnson feels that this was a morally bankrupt approach and it would be ridiculous if unspent money was not returned negotiation between the parties will decide the final amount
938038 the mayor is discussing with tfl how best to ensure that low income londoners who rely on the public transport system will continue to get the assistance they require
938039 this is a significant investment by the accord group which will go a long way to improving the homes of many of our residents
938040 by joining accord we have not only secured the future of moseley and district but have also ensured that the housing and services that we provide will continue to improve over the longer term this is the first step in that process
938041 we are working closely with moseley amp district to look at how we can help improve things for residents and felt it was important to put in a significant investment quickly
938042 providing excellent housing for people and creating the kind of safe and friendly neighbourhoods where people want to live is at the heart of what we do this money is a really important part of that

938045 its clear from research weve done that parents want to know their childs results and whether there is a concern about their health but they want clear information which is helpful and non stigmatising
938046 today weve published guidance which will help pcts deliver this programme and help to make sure parents get the information they need about their childs results in ways that they have said will be most helpful
938047 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think that their child is a healthy weight this important move isnt about pointing the finger and telling parents that their children are overweight instead its about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
938048 schools are well placed to make a real difference in tackling obesity with record investment in sport and exercise encouraging active travel to and from home making cooking compulsory in secondary schools scrapping junk food and transforming the quality of school lunches
938049 but at the end of the day parents bring up children not the government schools or health services every parent wants their child to be fit and healthy so its only right to help them make informed decisions about their lives
938050 students are increasingly aware of the wider economic climate and this is filtering down into their decisions when they are choosing their university and also when deciding whether to take a part time job during term time

938266 i dont fit into the bad side of american psychology
938267 the british are much more intelligent and civilised than the americans i love the english lifestyle im not as capitalistic as america
938268 in delaware the largest growth of population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 11 or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking

938270 we just go to a classroom and sit all day
938271 we have a housing market going into cardiac arrest this bill is like cpr to stabilize the situation
938272 will likely have little effect on the foreclosure crisis gripping the financial markets and economy
938273 if you take a look at the ugly kind of losses taking place investors dont want to see executives getting country club memberships while their stock is going down in value
938274 financial services has generally been on the skinny side on benefits and perquisites
938275 they have a philosophy that says were going to pay you a lot of money and you go figure out what to do with the money
938276 can explain the companys programs to the executive explain what the executive is entitled to and how to get the maximum benefit out of it
938277 a lot of people dont know about medical malls and how well they have done

938282 housing prices have already fallen 15 percent and they need to fall 10 percent more this bill isnt going to change that equation
938283 this legislation will not perform miracles i want the american people to have realistic expectations about what were about to do
938284 but as others have said it is a step and an important step towards putting our nation on the road to economic recovery
938285 this is not the bill he would have drafted on his own but its time for action
938286 who have been caught between rising mortgage payments and falling home values and are in danger of losing their homes
938287 everything is so unstable and people are so panicky that i see a lot of this as an effort to calm people down
938288 the whole bill is an attempt to change the equilibrium
938289 clearly in areas where home prices have dropped its going to be utilized more
938290 it also depends on the borrowers unique financial circumstances why are they struggling did they lose their job if its a temporary hardship then youre not going to use this program at all if its something of greater significance then this may be the best option
938291 how effective can the fha refinancing program be in light of how slow and ineffective mortgage servicers have been so far

938296 will likely have little effect on the foreclosure crisis gripping the financial markets and economy
938297 we have a housing market going into cardiac arrest this bill is like cpr to stabilize the situation
938298 this package should be enough life support to keep the situation from getting much worse and finally allow normal market forces to correct
938299 will likely have little effect on the foreclosure crisis gripping the financial markets and economy
938300 the authorities are needed so we would rather not delay
938301 it depends on when they deliver it to the white house
938302 the process was described to us as sleight of hand with the right intention
938303 this started in the previous administration and we got caught up in it
938304 there are a number of strategies in place on our part to correct this
938305 appropriate action for other staff that remain with the county and were involved with these payments
938306 you would lose people like us if there were slot machines
938307 i just have an impression of the kind of people that want to play slots

938312 the things that are necessary to transform a business dont come easily
938313 these consumer media storage products havent gained sufficient traction in the marketplace or the monetization levels necessary to offset the high cost associated with their operation
938314 there was a time at aol when the strength of our aggregate portfolio of products more than compensated for the weakness of an underperforming product
938315 the realities of the industry and market shifts in online advertising no longer make that possible simply put every product makes a direct impact on our bottom line
938316 our recent discussions and communications about belt tightening and cost management have been disruptive to our normal routine
938317 when i look back on my college days maybe it was a different era in the late 60s but most of my fraternity brothers didnt have criminal records not yet most of them even those who were in rotc and hunters but the behaviors they exhibited werent the kind of behaviors that gave me confidence that packing guns in their lockers or in their rooms would make me safer
938318 allowing handguns does provide extra protection and extra deterrent against crime
938319 its not a one stop solution but provides a deterrent and i feel very comfortable with people who have fulfilled their requirement to be able to carry
938320 the media likes to paint us as paranoid about mass shootings on campus
938321 what we are more concerned about are the types of crimes that happen on a daily basis on our campuses across the country these crimes are rape assault robberies these are things we should be able to protect ourselves against
938322 rather than creating safe zones for victims we may unintentionally be creating safe zones for criminals who are doing the attacks and who have less to worry about
938323 i think its absolutely ludicrous and theres no need for it
938324 i dont think you can make the argument that if you had a gun on campus you could have stopped the virginia tech rampage i think it would make it worse
938325 if anyone brought a gun to class id be scared out of my mind regardless if they are trying to stop someone who is shooting someone or not
938326 i think its absolutely ludicrous and theres no need for it
938327 i dont think you can make the argument that if you had a gun on campus you could have stopped the virginia tech rampage i think it would make it worse
938328 i think its absolutely ludicrous and theres no need for it

938355 jennifer garner gave the first speech supporting obama and she was very witty clever and funny
938356 she was followed by her husband ben then matt damon the men gave serious political speeches on how the country needs change
938357 for a lot of reasons but mostly because i don
938358 the men gave serious political speeches on how the country needs change

938367 how do you feel about anything or life in general
938368 i want to spend the rest of my life with you
938369 ill rather have bad times with you than good times with someone else
938370 dear having you beside me is all the love i ask for
938371 guess which diamond ring i bought for you today remember the lamborghini that you fancy the other day heres the key remember the 10000000 dollars in the bank i had heres the credit card to it enjoy shopping
938372 by embracing a tyrant who puts his people in prison because of their political beliefs whats lost is it will send the wrong message it will send a discouraging message to those who wonder whether america will continue to work for the freedom of prisoners im not suggesting theres never a time to talk but im suggesting now is not the time not to talk with ra l castro hes nothing more than an extension of what his brother did which was to ruin an island and imprison people because of their beliefs
938373 im going to the olympics in beijing because its a sporting event and im looking forward to seeing the athletic competition but that will not preclude me from meeting with the chinese president expressing my deep concerns about a variety of issues
938374 they are blurring for now at least the red blue lines that have colored the nations politics for the last several years
938375 i dont feel like obama is condemning me for being a republican
938376 susan eisenhower a gop business consultant and granddaughter of president eisenhower has endorsed the democratic hopeful
938377 colin l powell has hinted he may do so as well
938378 says he will continue to back the arizona senator but will step aside rather than work against obama
938379 i just feel this is a tremendous opportunity to open politics up to a new generation and i believe that barack obama is a genuine transformational candidate
938380 very rarely do you hear me talking about my opponents without giving them some credit for having good intentions and being decent people
938381 theres nothing uniquely democratic about a respect for civil liberties theres nothing uniquely democratic about believing in a foreign policy of restraint a lot of the virtues i talk about are virtues that are deeply embedded in the republican party
938382 given enough cultivation it could change the face of partisan alignments for a generation to come and ensure the dominance of progressive politics

938385 if he won the nomination he would limit himself to spending only the 85 million available in public financing between the convention and election day as long as his republican opponent did the same
938386 they would forgo public financing so they could raise unlimited funds in the general election
938387 the fact is senator obama signed a piece of paper and pledged to take public financing for his campaign if i did the same i believe that senator obama should keep his commitment the rest of it is ground noise the rest of it is irrelevant
938388 ought to be able to run a campaign for two months on 85 million
938389 said the campaign would not make a decision on public financing until the democratic primary is settled
938390 weve see the republicans consistently dissemble and manipulate the system to their own advantage
938391 in the process of campaigning ive learned a lot about the power of money and media in politics and only a fool would not utilize what he has learned therefore ive changed my mind about public financing end of story like it or lump it
938392 get a life grow up the right practices politics like theyre in middle school
938393 whatever we cant agree to a game in which the other side wont play by the rules fugetaboutit
938394 people are commenting increasingly on the disjunction between the elevated and exceptionally fine rhetoric and the rather pedestrian policy proposals that form the obama platform
938395 can i just point out that in the last several debates i seem to get the first question all the time
938396 the american people who support me are bankrolling my campaign thats obvious
938397 senator clinton has in her campaign at least has constantly sent out negative attacks on us and we havent whined about it because i understand thats the nature of this campaign
938398 my objections to the war in iraq were not simply a speech
938399 i was one of the most vocal opponents of the war and i was very specific as to why
938400 fact is that senator clinton often says that she is ready on day one but in further fact she was ready to give in to george bush on day one on this critical issue in yet further fact she facilitated and enabled this individual to make a decision that has been strategically damaging to the united states of america
938401 id be happy to have a debate discussion on that score
938402 america deceived from amazon stealing private lands kelo decision warrant less wiretapping and refusing to investigate 9 11 properly they are both guilty of treason
938403 mrs clinton alternated between high notes early in the debate smiling and nodding at mr obama pitching her economic plans for the umpteenth time and pointed criticisms that she has been making somewhat fruitlessly for weeks now like portraying mr obama as all talk and little action
938404 she noted that she opposed making english the official national language but also said it should remain a common unifying language for all americans
938405 mrs clinton defended her support for building a physical barrier along the border with mexico but at the same time she called for a review of the project which she said had become absurd under the bush administration
938406 would not meet with him until there was evidence that change is happening
938407 must win the texas and ohio primaries by at least 10 percentage points if she has any hope of catching up with mr obama in the delegate count
938408 even my opponents democratic opponent said of him during the primaries
938409 our positions are so close attacking each other makes us both look stupid
938410 but this is a tactical victory imposed upon a huge strategic blunder
938411 our positions are so close attacking each other makes us both look stupid
938412 but this is a tactical victory imposed upon a huge strategic blunder
938413 you know whatever happens were going to be fine you know we have strong support from our families and our friends i just hope that well be able to say the same thing about the american people and thats what this election should be about
938414 whats not at stake are any of us all of us are going to be just fine no matter what happens in this election but whats at stake is whether america is going to be fine
938415 i want to say this to everyone with elizabeth with my family with my friends with all of you and all of your support this son of a millworkers gonna be just fine our job now is to make certain that america will be fine
938416 we love ya big guy but for heavens sake dont call us well call you
938417 senator john mccains campaign advisers will ask the white house to deploy president bush for major republican fund raising but they do not want the president to appear too often at his side
938418 using mr bush enough to try to make the tough sell of mr mccain to conservatives but not so much that he will drive away the independents and some moderate democrats that mr mccain is counting on in november
938419 ruthless partisanship fiscal recklessness polarization presidential monarchism and the erosion of u s credibility on human rights
938420 if the bush years were snakebit think of mccain as an antivenin wise republicans know to begin with that the party is lost if it cannot rebuild its own center and appeal to the countrys
938421 told national public radio last week that although he supported mr mccain he would not be part of the senators campaign if senator barack obama was the democratic nominee because he would be uncomfortable in a campaign that would inevitably be attacking him
938422 lets get real about this election lets get real about our future lets get real about what it is we can do together
938423 get ting real about what it is we can do together
938424 democrats and bloggers are already reacting with fury fearing a rerun of 2000 when nader drained crucial votes from al gore
938425 dont think its divisive look above nader can only divide progressives risk the election and ruin his legacy

938428 to break into that quartet is tough but a number of quality players have come in and well be doing our best to get amongst it
938429 as soon as he came you could see why he was so successful at other clubs
938430 so the selection process was a mere warm up the only real work would be in the general
938431 over the course of her six years as a new york senator and in the early days of her presidential campaign hillary rodham clinton cultivated an unlikely set of allies the conservative media
938432 if the conservative base hated her many members of the conservative elite did not
938433 rode her decline as gleefully as he watched her rise and the pundit class moved from its grudging respect for clinton into an infatuation with obama
938434 she possessed no real philosophical grounding that she would blow with whatever the prevailing winds
938435 hillarys too vane as in a weather vane to be president
938436 mrs clinton wasted no time in signaling that she would now take a tougher line against mr obama
938437 i leave that to all of you to figure out
938438 obama would be more likely than mrs clinton by 63 percent to 37 percent to defeat the republican nominee in the fall
938439 there is hardly anything that needs to be added to your succinct statement of the present political moment
938440 this is the first time i have been proud of my country in a long time
938441 i dont do live unscripted talk radio because i cant control spin the message
938442 if this is the only toll free alternative the toll evaders from the pattullo and the port mann are going to find their way to our community over the alex fraser bridge
938443 our streets are congested as it is our community was never built for that kind of traffic north delta is becoming the doormat for everybody going home from work over the alex fraser to surrey and points beyond
938444 people in delta people who live around the alex fraser wont appreciate that
938445 when the liberal government proposed the twinning of the port mann bridge
938446 there was a promise implicit in that there would be no tolling of the pattullo bridge so that there was a toll free option offered to commuters
938447 its very disappointing to see now that translink finds itself with inadequate funding to replace this bridge and having to look at tolling it it really narrows the number of options for commuters
938448 a modest toll does not act as a big dissuasion for people to make a travel decision at least thats what all the traffic studies tell us
938449 when you do the traffic modelling what you find and the port mann is the best example is that today when people are spending 4 hours sitting on a bridge wasting time if they have the option of paying a few dollars to get across it a lot faster people will do that
938450 it would cost as much to rehabilitate the pattullo to provide three lanes for 50 years as it would to add three lanes on a new bridge that will last 100 years
938451 but the reality of it is that she would be nearly 94 by the end of another term
938452 no one of substance will run against hazel mccallion she is just too revered in this city

938525 the government set up the truth commission in a bid to spur economic activities which slowed down after the crackdown on corruption suspects
938526 corruption is everywhere in society and there are some people who were unwillingly involved in it moreover the move to set up the commission will lessen the burden of the courts of law dealing with the corruption cases
938527 it may bring respite immediately but it will not bring in any success in the long run
938528 corruption increases the cost of transaction and the government ultimately needs to curb corruption and ensure good governance for a sound economy
938529 the truth commission is the consequence of contradictions in the policy of the present government they apparently wanted to change the country without changing the policy framework so negotiations even with corrupt persons are a must
938530 there is nothing to be optimistic or pessimistic about it will just try to do my job and the end results will show whether the commission succeeds

938567 i surrender mr judge even though it feels so heavy the punishment that i must bear because im aware that this is definitely not as sad as has been felt by both parents and the family of heidi murphy for losing the person they loved
938568 im also aware that my action has tainted and slander bali image as tourist destination
938569 please honorary judges consider being a little bit more lenient with me so that i can have the chance to improve my life and so that i can do good deeds to others for now and for the future
938570 i also beg and ask for the greatest forgiveness from the parents and family of heidi murphy who have lost their most loving daughter
938571 i also offer an apology to my own parents for causing this very deep pain
938572 i didnt know anything about the murder i only knew about the burglary

938586 il lavoro che stanno facendo gli italiani molto importante perch dobbiamo dare un futuro felice a questo paese

938590 leggendo le storie di questo lavoro mi sembrato di conoscerle tutte o forse perch ne rivedevo una sola quella del mio consuocero mi onoro di avere un consuocero emigrato in svizzera che rimboccandosi le maniche ha raggiunto una posizione sociale rispettabilissima oggi gestore di un ristorante di grande successo ed un quotato artista e andato via da vicenza che aveva 19 anni ed anche se non facile la vita degli italiani in svizzera riuscito a ritagliarsi un suo spazio giorno dopo giorno faticando come un dannato come tanti altri italiani sparsi per il mondo italiani che a distanza di decenni manifestano ancora tutto lorgoglio per la loro terra

938593 my dreadful discovery of the second kind of cockroaches in manila took place several days ago during my first night at the new apartment where i had forgotten to initially bring an electric fan i found that these crawlers were infinitely creepier and consumed perhaps by deeply familial ties downright suicidal they kept coming and coming in between chapters of colm t ib n the first one taking off from the edge of a splintery closet door and fluttering straight to the wild hairs of my left leg after getting it off with a violent jerk i began chasing the cockroach whereupon its short life came to an end with the vicious smack of a pony sandal and yet how many of them had followed

938600 michael robinson mark roman david baas jerard rabb the wide receiver lewis baker the defensive back and parys haralson parys shoulder is a little banged up so i want to keep him down here to get some treatment on that
938601 you know guys weve got about 15 training camp days left and weve scripted those things out it should be five five and five one of these might count as one of the 15 left but rather than whos first whos second the rest of the way we kind of scripted out from first second and third team i only say that because id have to go and look at my notes to see whos winning where and what but like i said the objective is to get them all with the different groups and thats what our next 15 look like
938602 yeah i thought that they were very beneficial the objective for both teams is to work against some other people and weve got to keep it on that level thats why i say its not a scrimmage it will be a practice as weve had thus far so there will be no live to the ground type of drills i think that sometimes is where it gets a little heated at the same time theyll be competing its important to them i know all the guys will take pride in what theyre doing and if someone feels that theyve gone too far somebody might try to get an understanding but i hope that both teams have a good understanding i believe they will otherwise we wouldnt be doing it
938603 yeah theyll go in the early part of practice theres a quick stretch and then about a 10 minute segment where the two special teams will work against each other i believe right now its punt return well probably keep it like that for the morning and the evening kickoff and kickoff coverage type of things are hard to get in prior to team drills theres a possibility of us doing a little field goal stuff but again the punt and punt return will happen for sure the other things well wait and see those other things are dangerous plays kickoff and kickoff return is a dangerous play and so is a field goal to some degree
938604 die itf ist angewiesen herrn rainer sch ttler in den herreneinzel wettbewerb der 24 olympiade aufzunehmen
938605 ich habe darauf vertraut dass der cas eine gerechte l sung findet
938606 ich freue mich riesig und bin gl cklich dass ich in peking nun spielen darf
938607 ich finde es sehr erfreulich dass der cas im sinne der spieler entschieden hat
938608 das wurde notwendig weil die itf mich entgegen den eigenen bestimmungen nicht auf die zulassungsliste f r die olympischen spiele aufgenommen hatte und die bef rchtung bestand dass die itf spieler in die einzelkonkurrenz aufnehmen wollte die auf der weltrangliste zum stichtag vom 9 juni 2008 weit hinter mir platziert waren

938618 iraq conflict has become the cause celebre for jihadists breeding a deep resentment of u s involvement in the muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement
938619 the increased u s military presence in the middle east in direct combat roles confirms terrorist narratives of an american war on islam and generates popular sympathies in the muslim world for their cause
938620 this counterterrorism model requires a long term commitment of competent personnel able to operate effectively with people of different linguistic and cultural backgrounds and should not be limited to drawing on one services personnel furthermore each services personnel would have specific knowledge and capabilities to impart to allied forces its critical that the adviser corps produces local security forces that are capable of countering terrorism and insurgency rather than mirror imaging conventional u s forces as occurred in the vietnam war
938621 we dont just talk about the enemy we talk about the environment
938622 history demonstrates that successful counterinsurgency requires an integrated civil military effort focused on strengthening local institutions not just chasing down bad guys
938623 if our people our troops the men and women in uniform particularly out in the combat zones with all that we had going on had an idea however they acquired it that their commander was at odds with their commander in chief that is a situation which is intolerable to my mind
938624 the most tragic error a general can make is to assume without much reflection that wars of the future will look much like wars of the past following world war i french generals committed this error assuming that the next war would involve static battles dominated by firepower and fixed fortifications throughout the interwar years french generals raised equipped armed and trained the french military to fight the last war in stark contrast german generals spent the interwar years attempting to break the stalemate created by firepower and fortifications they developed a new form of war the blitzkrieg that integrated mobility firepower and decentralized tactics

938768 apakah agama ini dihantar oleh allah untuk menghukum manusia bawahan dan menghalalkan yang lain tidur dalam kekenyangan dan kemewahan
938769 dan berikanlah kepada kaum keluargamu dan orang miskin serta orang musafir akan haknya masing masing dan janganlah engkau membazir dengan pembaziran yang melampau sesungguhnya orang orang yang membazir itu adalah saudara saudara syaitan sedang syaitan itu pula sangat kufur kepada tuhannya

938771 not the end of the world if a child has an accident
938772 playing is an essential part of growing up and adventurous play that both challenges and excites children helps instill critical life skills
938773 constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life
938774 children are not being allowed many of the freedoms that were taken for granted when we were children they are not enjoying the opportunities to play outside that most people would have thought of as normal when they were growing up
938775 that is very difficult for parents to manage because of the time pressures on normal family life
938776 as the pace of technology increases the amount of toxic electronic waste is piling up at home and abroad
938777 many americans are unaware that discarded electronics often contain lead mercury and other toxins and end up being salvaged under inhumane conditions in the developing world
938778 if the epa cannot or will not act to halt the toxic e waste trade to developing nations then congress should take action
938779 this resolution calling for a ban on the export of e waste to developing countries is a signal to the rest of the world that the u s government understands the environmental and personal devastation caused by sending our toxic electronic scrap to poor communities around the globe
938780 this resolution doesnt call for a ban on all exports just exports to the developing nations
938781 exporting e waste to the developed countries which have laws and governments that protect workers and the environment would still be allowed

938805 2 the case involves two children r who was born on 2 june 1999 in the democratic republic of congo drc and who is therefore now a little over seven years old and her younger sister a who was born on 5 may 2002 in south africa and who is therefore now some four and a half years old
938806 the father thought that we were going away on a holiday but it was always my intention that i would not return my brother knew that was the plan as i had told him
938807 your clients asylum claim has been reconsidered on all the evidence available including the further submissions but it has been decided that the decision of 13 october 2005 upheld by the immigration judge on the 15 december 2005 should not be reversed as they do not give rise to a realistic prospect of success before an immigration judge because it has been decided not to reverse the decision on the earlier claim and it has been determined that your clients submissions do not amount to a fresh claim you have no further right of appeal your client has no legal basis of stay in the united kingdom but no step will be taken to remove her until the proceedings in the family court are finalised
938808 our client has been advised by the immigration solicitor dealing with her case that there is no further action she can take in respect of the decision to refuse her claim for asylum
938809 our client entered the uk as a visitor together with her two dependant daughters on 24th august 2005 she made an in country application for asylum on 24th august 2005 she and her daughters have remained living in the uk continuously since that time we understand that the home office is currently considering families under the legacy exercise who have been in the uk for around 3 years our client has been in the uk for a period approaching 3 years her daughters are now aged 5 and 8 they have undertaken all of their education in the uk and have very strong ties to the uk now
938810 although the time your client has spent in the united kingdom is nearing three years from september 2005 until march 2006 miss m failed to comply with her reporting restrictions and was considered to have absconded thus this time would not be taken into account when assessing her length of residence similarly her personal history and character are in question given that she supplied false identities for both her and her children when arriving claiming and submitted an asylum claim on false grounds concerning her husband working for m decins sans fronti res your client does not have any domestic or compassionate circumstances indeed there is an issue before the family court about the return of the children to their father in mozambique therefore whilst it is accepted that your clients children have had a small proportion of their education conducted in the united kingdom when balanced against the issues detailed above this is outweighed by the contrary issues within her case in the circumstances and having taken into account the above factors and your clients circumstances it has been decided that your client does not qualify for status and is subject to administrative removal
938811 a there being no person who has parental responsibility for him b his being lost or having been abandoned or c the person who has been caring for him being prevented whether or not permanently and for whatever reason from providing him with suitable accommodation or care
938812 2 where a local authority provide accommodation under subsection 1 for a child who is ordinarily resident in the area of another local authority that other local authority may take over the provision of accommodation for the child within a three months of being notified in writing that the child is being provided with accommodation or b such other longer period as may be prescribed
938813 6 before providing accommodation under this section a local authority shall so far as is reasonably practicable and consistent with the childs welfare a ascertain the childs wishes regarding the provision of accommodation and b give due consideration having regard to his age and understanding to such wishes of the child as they have been able to ascertain
938814 before deciding which section of the children act 1989 provides the appropriate legal basis for provision of help or support to a child in need a local authority should undertake an assessment in accordance with the statutory guidance set out in the framework for the assessment of children in need and their families published by the government in april 2000 it should then use the findings of that assessment which will include taking account of the wishes and feelings of the child as required by section 20 6 of the children act as the basis for any decision about whether he should be provided with accommodation under section 20 and therefore become looked after or whether other types of services provided under section 17 of the act are better suited to his circumstances the assessment should first determine whether the child meets the criteria set out in section 20 1 while the needs assessment is being carried out he should be cared for under section 20
938815 where a social services department provides help under section 17 which involves providing or funding accommodation out of their own area the placing department does not relinquish responsibility for the case unless it is specifically and formally transferred to another local authority in addition the placing authority should consider whether it is the childs best interests to advise the second authority of the placement and should do so unless there are strong reasons not to
938816 it is i think implicit in this provision that the local authority will assess the actual needs of a child in need whenever it appears necessary to do so
938817 the limited and temporary nature of hammersmiths duty also distinguishes this case from the cases where an authority accommodates children in need in the area of another authority to have access to specialist services or to be close to particular relatives pursuant to a duty which is not so limited and temporary as mr giffin conceded an authority under a duty to provide services cannot bring that duty to an end by transferring a person to the area of another authority
938818 requiring physical presence is a clearer test than a purposive approach under which the nature and duration of the presence or the responsibilities of the different authorities in the frame are taken into account
938819 i however reject mr giffins submission that physical presence although necessary is not sufficient and that the need must co exist with the presence
938820 the next question is whether either lambeth or wandsworth have failed to do something they were under a duty to do wandsworths position as i have stated earlier in this judgment was that notwithstanding the childrens physical presence at wandsworth schools they were not in need in wandsworth and therefore it was not under a section 17 duty mr giffin submitted that since the children were accommodated in lambeth it was not wednesbury unreasonable for wandsworth not to provide accommodation and it was not therefore in breach of its duty under section 17 this however goes to the content of the duty and what needs to be done by the authority with the children within its area and what services need to be provided by it rather than to the identification of the authority with a duty to assess
938821 11 i restated hillingdons position ms martin confirmed that she was aware of a tribunal decision and a paediatrician report both of which concluded that ak is a minor ms martin also confirmed that liverpool were in receipt of a letter from aks solicitor informing them that ak wished to return to liverpool 12 i suggested to ms martin that in the interest that ak may be a minor i could arrange for his release into accommodation over the weekend provided by hillingdon with a view to liverpool making arrangements to reassess him ms martin thanked me for this i subsequently emailed her confirming our discussion ms martin has never responded to this email or indicated that she did not accept its content 13 arrangements were made for ak to be released from harmondsworth on the evening of friday 9 may this was facilitated by our emergency duty team he was placed in accommodation over the weekend 14 hillingdon social services provided accommodation under s17 no assessments were undertaken as it was our belief that we were providing accommodation only for ak pending liverpool social services arranging to reassess him 15 on the next working day monday 12 may elizabeth hearst made several attempts to make direct contact with liverpools team manager and received no response 16 on 13 may a social worker from liverpool relayed a message from the manager to ms hearst stating that liverpool were not accepting responsibility 17 on 13 may ak was interviewed by a social worker in hillingdon asylum intake team during which he made it clear he wanted to return to liverpool the worker also phoned aks solicitor who confirmed that his client wished to return to liverpool and that a letter had been sent to liverpool requesting this but liverpool had not responded 18 on 13 may hillingdon social services legal department faxed a letter to liverpools legal department outlining our position and their responsibilities and stating that the young person wished to return to liverpool
938822 further to our telephone conversation i have agreed in principle that our service will provide accommodation for the above named young person pending a re assessment of his age it is our contention that any re assessment of age should be undertaken by liverpool as the original assessing authority i look forward to this matter being resolved at the earliest opportunity and team manager beth hearst will continue to liaise with you about this
938823 just to confirm that the above young person was taken out of detention friday night and provided with accommodation as per the agreement you reached with paula what can we do to further assist you with this matter today the young person is clear that he wants to return to liverpool as soon as possible
938824 do you have a direct work number i can reach you on ive tried phoning over 4 times throughout the course of today on the main number given to us 01512258620 and no one is picking up as paula said we would like to resolve this matter as soon as possible
938825 i understand from your social worker who phoned me yesterday that you have access to your e mails attached is a copy of the letter sent from our legal department to yours yesterday our position and your responsibilities are outlined very clearly we are advising the young person to present to your office
938826 a la approached for an age assessment should check whether any previous assessment has been carried out by another la the host la should request a copy of the age assessment from the original la and base further action on the content in the event that no new evidence is being brought forward that was not considered at the original assessment the issue should be treated as a complaint about the original assessment and referred to the la responsible for it in the event that new evidence has been brought forward the host la should continue to reassess the age of the applicant taking full account of all sources of information

938833 there are still many unanswered questions regarding prues disappearance mr clark said
938834 she had no criminal history nor did she have any known personal reasons to run away from home she left a hot meal uneaten on the table and did not take any possessions with her
938835 it is as though she simply disappeared off the face of the earth
938836 for 16 years prues mother has had to live without knowing what happened to her daughter and we believe somebody out there has information that can solve this mystery

938838 die meisten angestellten durchleben im laufe ihres berufslebens mal phasen in denen sie nicht wie gew nscht weiterkommen
938839 in zeiten in denen schornsteinkarrieren seltener werden ist das durchaus normal
938840 es werden nicht unbedingt die besten be und gef rdert sondern die die zum unternehmen passen
938841 es n tzt nichts flei ig und akribisch zu sein wenn der chef leute sucht die ihm einfach nur u erst schnell kreative l sungen vorschlagen
938842 viele mitarbeiter verstehen unter karriere noch sich m glichst viele streifen ans revers zu heften von dieser vorstellung muss man sich aber freimachen
938843 selbst f r high potentials gilt es reicht nicht im vermeintlichen goldfischteich des unternehmens zu landen sie m ssen sich dort auch bewegen
938844 wer mobil ist und seine chancen wahrnimmt wird schneller weiterkommen wer sich dagegen vom chef auf sp ter vertr sten l sst wird lange auf der stelle treten
938845 einfach mittags die stulle nicht alleine im eigenen b ro essen sondern rausgehen und die augen offen halten
938846 statt sich frustrieren zu lassen hilft es sich zwischenschritte oder alternativen zu suchen
938847 wenn die firma mit der restrukturierung besch ftigt ist sollte man nicht um einen englischkurs bitten es sei denn das unternehmen fusioniert gerade mit einer firma im angloamerikanischen raum
938848 wenn wir das potenzial f r eine bestimmte entwicklung nicht sehen dann sagen wir das offen und lassen den mitarbeiter nicht jahrelang in dem glauben er sei ein kracher
938849 he was very difficult to get hold of on his mobile phone which is often the case with people working on film sets but he was supposed to be collecting the guns every two or three weeks
938850 sometimes we would not see him for months on end and he would show up out of the blue and say he had lost his phone so had a new number
938851 he appeared desperately disorganised and after a while i became suspicious
938852 he was acting in a way that would cause the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up so i took a picture of him on my mobile phone when he came to pick up an order without him noticing
938853 i thought it might be relevant and then almost two years later the police came to see me about this enquiry and i was able to print off the photo for them
938854 nee anne we hebben vorige week ook al schoenen gekocht voor je werk
938855 there is in my view a requirement at common law that a costs agreement between a solicitor and client be fair and reasonable
938856 but if costs agreements of this kind are to be obtained from clients it is necessary that the solicitor obtaining them consider carefully her fiduciary and other duties that she be conscious of the extent to which the agreements contain provisions which put her in a position of advantage and or conflict of interest and that she take care that by explanation independent advice or otherwise the client exercises an independent and informed judgment in entering into them
938857 they very quickly escalate rewards from there soon reaching 40 000 or 50 000 for more complex work
938858 i am sure you all share my deep disappointment that the doha trade negotiations failed to reach agreement last week
938859 while we may not have succeeded this time around achieving significant global trade and investment liberalisation in the future is not only possible it is imperative
938860 to fail to do so would be to fail our children
938861 as wto chief pascal lamy said we need to let the dust settle before deciding the next steps forward
938862 what is clear is that we must continue on the path of trade and investment liberalisation using all of the forums available to us
938863 in this regard we are extremely fortunate to have apec at our disposal to continue with this task in our region
938864 structural economic reform is important in its own right for enhancing efficiencies and competition and driving domestic economic growth and prosperity
938865 however it also enhances our multilateral trade objectives because it helps to break down the behind the border or non tariff barriers that stymie international trade
938866 with the doha round on hold policymakers are searching for new ways forward to make progress on deregulation and reform aimed at securing productivity growth and competitiveness in a more deeply integrated global economy
938867 most of these burdens are a product of domestic regulations and institutions that only national governments can deal with
938868 the department has conducted an exhaustive search of databases and has no record for a visa application having been lodged for mr al masri to visit australia nor political representations having been made to the ministers office
938869 it is easy to make the changes and get to number one but it is also easy to slip right back down again
938870 you need to work hard to maintain the standards and a amp e has proven itself but it is not just about a amp e it is about how we run the whole hospital and we are very proud of all of our staff
938871 time and time again they have performed to the highest standard and they continue to serve patients not only with speed and expertise but also with a personal desire to do the absolute best they can for patients
938872 the a amp e team is setting an example of great care and we want to replicate their success across the trust
938873 the number one ranking is a feat the trust has achieved before not only for the quarter but also annually
938874 last year from april 2007 to 31 march 2008 royal berkshire nhs foundation trust was the number one performing acute trust hospital in the country in this area

938889 at this stage were looking at about ten childcare centres that would be required
938890 but the most important thing is it adds to the regulations the strength of childcare in new south wales
938891 i would hope that in future wed have no one on this list that would be the aim
938892 they need the biggest possible incentive thats why the government should be even bolder really penal rates for high emission cars and really attractive carrots so that tax is almost nothing on the greenest models
938893 theres a possibility that new mexico gov bill richardson will be the democratic vice presidential candidate so thats possibly whats drawing hispanics
938894 senator mccain has a very strong base of support from latinos and we obviously want to continue to grow that support
938895 hes worked with democrats to craft compassionate immigration reform which is a vital issue to latinos senator obama was not supportive of those efforts
938896 were most pleased to report that oregonians will share in the benefits that congress including most members of the states delegation approved and the president signed
938897 calculations of the overall benefits to the state are in process we do not yet know the totals but we do know the dollar value is significant
938898 you can build a lot of apartments and homes and help preserve many housing units with that kind of money
938899 this is a valuable credit because it reflects real money
938900 the possible damage they could do to my brothers and sister if there is even the slightest chance they are guilty does not seem worth giving them the chance at bail
938901 he used his hand his belt a wooden spoon and then a shoe when his hand got sore
938902 my father told my grandparents my guardians and his parents that he had a follower that had offered to come down to california snatch us up and beat up my grandparents
938903 everyone is hoping they dont have anything to do with graydon and robyn again
938904 im hoping these nine kids are not going to be subjected to graydon again its terrible to think whats been happening with them
938905 my frank conclusion is its doubtful it will be set within a range with any reasonable likelihood of graydon drown being able to bail himself out
938906 they are having scheduled visitation with each other during the week
938907 some have been on camping trips and some are participating in a summer school program
938908 it was kind of a family understanding that graydon just kept getting more and more fanatical really fundamentalist extremely strict and inflexible
938909 he had a kind of insular family life and kept his wife pregnant
938910 he was excommunicated for being too radical and arguing too much with the ministers of the church
938911 there was probable cause for believing we were being physically abused
938912 police came to our house and asked some questions they heard enough that they took us out of there
938913 because of graydons religion and his belief that he had the right to be severe with the children
938914 father was disinclined with anyone telling them what to do so they left and moved to alaska
938915 my father would deliver sermons the only time he had with his kids all year and he was preaching at us
938916 this was very upsetting to me and for usually a month after one of these phone calls i would be very difficult to handle
938917 i grew up with the fear of them lurking in the shadows and even today i have a remnant of anxiety every time i go into a dark room
938918 every time we heard there was another baby everyone in the family would just feel helpless knowing what graydon is like
938919 when i was little i thought they were replacing us
938920 later i just wanted to believe they had changed everybody did
938921 they thought that now i was legally able to make my own choice of course i would want to go live with them because id been kidnapped
938922 i had just gotten engaged with my high school sweetheart and i made it very clear i wasnt going anywhere
938923 my parents and i came to an understanding that as long as we talked about parenting and happy things we would get along
938924 he stopped talking with me about religion because he knew i wouldnt stand for it
938925 i was absolutely heartbroken ive never completely trusted my father but i was cautiously optimistic
938926 would be a threat to my brothers and sister and a threat to their foster parents
938927 i believe that even knowing that my father was out of jail could cause my siblings to be afraid please do not grant him any bail however high to my mind it is not worth the risk
938928 i do not know if she is completely controlled by my father or not
938929 however if she is i believe her fully capable of saying things that would make her children feel guilty about testifying against both herself and their father
938930 you still want name brand stuff but you find alternative ways to do it

938952 we were definitely not playing up to our usual standard we were tired and probably nervous because this is the first time weve been in the tournament but even though we wish we could have been first second is still great
938953 they made an impact in this town ive been to several restaurants who told me that the next time we have a tournament like this we need to warn them ahead of time
938954 but we did tell them they just didnt believe us we told them we were going to pack this city

938962 the lessons they have learned are for running big companies and it is really different when you run a small start up

939023 savings have gone up by 1 5 million dollars since the quake
939024 its because people no longer have no houses to hide their money in
939025 people here are saying if you have money you may as well eat it now

939040 weve already had our first casualty expressjet announced that they were ceasing operations in september they were pulling out of over 30 markets it wasnt just monterey
939041 because companies arent going to move to an area that doesnt have good air service
939042 if you didnt have a railroad and you werent connected to the rest of the rail system in the country your community died
939043 we depend on aviation to get to the majority of our communities 280 of our communities its the only way in and out
939044 basically what that means is that those communities have no service at this time at all and so it is truly a coming crisis for us
939045 it doesnt belong to the ceos of the airlines it doesnt belong to the shareholders of the airlines it belongs to all americans
939046 on average only three passengers are flying each of these flights so were paying a significant subsidy to fly mostly empty airplanes

939048 the only people who cant seem to back out of it is congress because this is a nice little gift to give their districts
939049 i am such a committed carnivore it can hardly be exaggerated
939050 i take the view that all food is wonderful to eat
939051 so i dont really see the point in having a hierarchy
939052 the real revelation i think is the intense meatiness of the mushroom sauce
939053 i tend to use cremini mushrooms but any that you can get at the farmers market or that you grow yourself are just about fine

939065 the authorities are increasingly concerned about the potential slowdown of the chinese economy given the further downshift in global demand and financial market turmoil the increasing challenges faced by small and medium sized enterprises and the rising living costs for the low income group
939066 policymakers will shift direction to structural adjustment from its blanket tightening policy
939067 several sectors including exports and small and medium sized enterprises might benefit from the policy shift
939068 this is not just an economic issue this is also a social issue
939069 right now we believe we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
939070 driving the frozen inter korean relations to a catastrophic phase
939071 i am extremely resistant to the notion that we are going to adjourn the beginning of the trial
939072 it is regrettable that mr saduloev did not sign until last friday he did sign he did not die and then become resurrected and die again he is alive and well but for whatever reasons for reasons we say of his travel and difficulty with communication and him just being too busy to look at it too preoccupied it was not signed until friday july 25
939073 we intend that mr saduloev will give evidence in person at the trial i cannot give an absolute 100 guarantee that that will happen but that is the intention and your lordship has already made observations in relation to there being no permission for evidence by video link at this stage anyway
939074 if he does not turn up then his evidence will fall away

939088 if getting a nod from the worlds nuclear watchdog the iaea is like climbing a mountain the next stride of getting a yes from the global cartel that controls nuclear commerce the nsg will be like climbing a vertical cliff
939089 even hardened veterans of the nuclear watchdogs politics were taken aback by the vehemence with which austria railed against the draft
939090 our repeated demand that there should be a clean and unconditional exemption from nsg guidelines cannot but prejudice the minds of the nsg members and even of the us
939091 the whole exercise of exemption is based on certain conditions which did not exist before like the 123 agreement and the iaea safeguards agreement is it realistic to expect that the nsg would grant the exemption without reference to any of these documents would such references be considered conditional or not the whole exercise of the deal is based on certain conditions that india put forward in the joint statement of 2005 how can the nsg not take note of those conditions
939092 if india takes the position that no conditions will be acceptable a situation may arise when india will have to walk away from the deal at that stage
939093 hopefully india has its own understanding as to what unconditional exemption means a certain flexibility in this position is essential to carry the deal through
939094 talks on irans nuclear program in geneva indicated a shift of the us policy toward iran in line with the james baker lee hamilton recommendations of 2006
939095 has found out that iran is a country which cannot be ignored and the presence of us under secretary william burns in the geneva talks on july 19 approves such a finding
939096 the probable outcome is that washington will refrain from military action to forestall iranian nuclear arms developments while tehran will refrain from disrupting washingtons potemkin village in iraq in this exchange iran gives up nothing of importance for the rage of the iraqi shiites will only wax over time tehran retains the option to stir things up in iraq whenever it chooses to do so its capacity to do so will increase with time as iraq grows less stable
939097 iran wants an independent stable and tranquil iraq in its neighborhood
939098 we may never quite know the extent to which any role washington would have played in ensuring that the government led by prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was not unseated by turkeys constitutional court in the trial regarding the alleged islamist agenda of the ruling justice development party akp
939099 the united states is deeply disturbed by reports that pakistani president musharraf has taken extra constitutional actions and has imposed a state of emergency a state of emergency would be a sharp setback for pakistani democracy and takes pakistan off the path toward civilian rule
939100 we expect the fed statement will be neutral with greater concern about the outlook for growth balanced by continued concerns about upside risks to the outlook for inflation
939101 the community is in shock not so long ago there was this very happy event with two lovely people and two lovely families and then out of the blue comes this sad news

939113 on monitoring the crinan canal sea lock following its closure for a temporary repair it has become clear that although the repair itself is sound other parts of the lock cill are now giving cause for concern
939114 as public safety is at the forefront of our operations british waterways scotland has taken the decision to close the lock once again to minimise any risk
939115 we will not be accepting vessels through the crinan canal certainly for the next few days

939128 attempted to murder several other people either through poisoning he is a revenge killer
939129 bruce told me that all of them had been detained at different locations his children and his wife and then himself and they were extensively questioned and they told his wife and his children some disturbing things about their father being a murderer
939130 i think simply bruce was a high strung person and very sensitive and this pressure was just simply adding to his depression that ultimately caused him to kill himself
939131 deep in my heart i wont believe he had anything to do with it until i see him in the afterlife and he says yeah i did it russ thats the only way im really going to believe it deep in my heart thats the truth

939139 your wow score would be just one factor that will go into your blizzard level and rather than call it a score we just wanted it to be like youre leveling up on blizzard games youll have this blizzard identity and youll be able to see things like oh this guy was great at diablo iii but he never played starcraft and he was mediocre in wow that sort of thing

939147 they have a group early in the morning bang their bodies against the trees i cant say much about people playing music there is one guy hollering all the time embarrassing but fine
939148 but for them to actually have a regular way of banging on the trees the trees are uneven so banging on them seems to stimulate circulation

939159 while we must reflect the global stock market as it is we must also recognize the rapid rise of companies in countries such as india
939160 we have already seen great indian companies acquiring famous brands such as jaguar and land rover but these developments are just the beginning of a long term trend that will fundamentally change the international corporate landscape
939161 we will see huge capital flows both from and to india in coming years and that is an opportunity for us as a financial information company as well as for international investors who want to take advantage of this profound trend

939174 when we talk about pushing a tests limit of detection or lod were referring to the signal to noise ratio
939175 its really a matter of figuring out how to reduce the background noise and make the signal stand above the noise
939176 we identified a location that has the maximal signal to noise ratio
939177 by focusing on this signal rich point of light we extended the lod by two orders of magnitude
939178 about 90 percent of our time was spent in sample preparation not actually performing the assay
939179 with further integration and automation of the test the time could be reduced significantly
939180 the optical sensor requires a more expensive set up because of the confocal microscope
939181 so in a small dental or doctors office the electrochemical sensor generally would be easier and cheaper to use but to really push down the signal to noise ratio the optical sensor has the advantage

939183 this jump in incarceration rates represents a massive intervention in american families at a time when the federal government was making claims that it was less involved in their lives

939215 he has a very calm personality and makes everyone feel comfortable i have only had a short time in the dressing room but he has made me feel at home

939232 rwandan farmers grow great coffee and deserve all the credit if they control their own production cycle here then they can fundamentally change the economic prospects of this country
939233 rwandan coffee is very highly regarded by professional coffee tasters and judges but typically farmers just sell their coffee they could fetch much profit if the coffee was roasted and processed here
939234 the hope is that we would be able to get donors for more farmers and actually do the roasting and the processing operation then profits would be greater and spread to more farmers and find more retail outlets like us africa and the middle east and other high consumption countries
939235 rwanda is graded among the best quality coffee producers and we are going to use the cup of excellence competition as a platform to expose our product on the international market
939236 the leaders used our hard earned money to set up business for their own benefit they have failed to pay

939241 i have no apology for wanting to have a well planned city i want it faster than i can actually have it
939242 without these demolitions we lose development so we have to put into account how much in terms of votes i lose and how much in terms of the countrys development i lose
939243 some people in rpf came and said no you cant do that bring culprits to account we are going for elections and you know if we take action you will lose votes
939244 and i told them i did not need votes from thieves and i honestly meant it i did make sure they took them to account

939261 the questions are easy to answer and cannot form an obstacle at all
939262 the report shows that the countrys foreign missions incurred a total of ushs5 billion 2 8 billion in excess expenditure that was neither approved nor authorized by parliament moreover this is not the first time that the foreign missions are over shooting their budgets
939263 when someone spends money but doesnt have authority to spend it we treat it as a loss and the person who brought about the loss is held responsible
939264 it is estimated the average urban kenyan pays 16 bribes per month most of these bribes are fairly small but large ones are also taken
939265 the grand regency is seen as a symbol of kenyas corruption era politics the government recovered the hotel this year from kamlesh pattni a kenyan businessman at the centre of the goldenberg scandal of the 1990s in which the government compensated him with millions of dollars in a fake gold export scheme

939269 doctors are duty bound if they see one of their colleagues doing something untoward to report it
939270 the ama acknowledges clinicians have a role to play in maintaining patient safety through the reporting of misconduct where appropriate but the proposal to make this requirement mandatory must be very carefully considered
939271 clinicians currently undertake a range of surgical and clinical audits to monitor patient care and these should be further utilised through addressing screening and reporting problems to make this system work more effectively
939272 simply forcing clinicians to make subjective judgments and report these will not solve the problem
939273 what has happened in this case is that over a two year period between 2004 and 2006 this individual has been allowed on occasion to operate without appropriate supervision
939274 that was a result of a breakdown of communication between the college of surgeons the medical board and indeed queensland health
939275 what this report suggests is that a critical lack of communication between industry and government agencies is putting patients lives at risk
939276 the fact that a doctor with serious question marks over his head as to his clinical capability was allowed to operate without any supervision is beyond belief in this post patel era
939277 the department has conducted an exhaustive search of databases and has no record for a visa application having been lodged for mr al masri to visit australia nor political representations having been made to the ministers office

939289 the us remains a difficult market with rising unemployment and falling house prices
939290 it is clear that growth models in our industry based on high and increasing leverage will no longer be sustainable
939291 it is also clear that complexity in financial services and the recent consequences of failed risk management need to be addressed
939292 ultimately the real economy will recover from the crisis although it may get worse before it gets better financial markets will not and should not return to the status quo ante
939293 i feel a great deal of what i hoped for has happened
939294 weve found that very slowly theres a slightly different way of doing business what we havent had is a very consistent counter narrative flowing through the conference from people feeling disenfranchised
939295 i felt that archbishop orombis comments slightly misunderstood the role of the archbishop of canterbury as if the archbishop directed the communion its a historical given that this is where this particular mission began from and the archbishop retains permission to convene the communion no one has come up with a coherent alternative
939296 how would you effect a quick separation it sounds easier than it is actually not easier it just sounds quicker than it possibly could be
939297 and their language that speaks of two churches i dont think thats been the experience of the overwhelming majority of the people at this conference what you see at the eucharist every morning is not two churches
939298 every conference ive been to has that rhythm where at some point everybody loses confidence in the process but when things went wobbly it was important to say that we dont try to revise the conferences agenda on the back of an envelope and theres a theology to it its something to do with a belief that unity is an active matter not just a goal to be achieved
939299 id expect it to feel physically tiring because its a long physical day jane and i both thought wed commit to the process so we pray with everybody in the morning
939300 on the few evenings weve been able to knock off by 9 pm and unwind a bit thats helped with coping

939306 i would first express regret that your reporter was moved and i can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt that race had nothing to do with it
939307 were deeply concerned and disturbed that our reporter of all of those in that area was asked to move
939308 my understanding is that stephen was the only reporter approached and asked to leave the area and the only reporter in that area who is black another reporter who stood up for stephen was then asked to leave
939309 fraizer did not do himself any harm in manchester uniteds friendly against espanyol on saturday and i would not expect sir alex to say anything else at this stage
939310 all we can do is respect manchester uniteds wishes but make sure sir alex is not in any doubt as to our interest in fraizer we will just have to bide our time and be patient
939311 we do not have any strikers apart from wayne rooney and carlos tevez and frazier plays in that area
939312 he is quick and determined and he can do very well in the game fraizers future is here

939315 i was not particularly happy with the way he reacted in training so like every other player no different if you dont want to do your best at training are not prepared to knuckle down you wont be considered
939316 if robbie comes back monday morning and knuckles down he will be considered like everybody else no different to any other player at derby county
939317 he is no different to any other player unless someone wants to buy him or unless he doesnt want to be here then yes

939380 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
939381 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
939382 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
939383 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
939384 what has been unusual is that it has been the u s and afghanistan that have spoken the loudest on pakistans involvement in the embassy attack

939394 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
939395 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
939396 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
939397 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
939398 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

939406 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
939407 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
939408 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
939409 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
939410 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
939411 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
939412 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
939413 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
939414 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
939415 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
939416 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
939417 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
939418 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
939419 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
939420 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
939421 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
939422 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
939423 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
939424 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
939425 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
939426 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
939427 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
939428 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
939429 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
939430 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
939431 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
939432 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
939433 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
939434 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
939435 who are open to doing something on the production side
939436 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
939437 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
939438 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
939439 most of our friends are artists of various sorts in the sense that they dont want to have real jobs we figured one of these artists would do it

939445 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
939446 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
939447 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
939448 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
939449 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
939450 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
939451 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
939452 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
939453 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
939454 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
939455 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
939456 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
939457 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
939458 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
939459 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
939460 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
939461 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
939462 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
939463 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
939464 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
939465 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
939466 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
939467 fussball ist mehr als nur ein sport fussball ist euphorie religion und droge zugleich
939468 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
939469 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
939470 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
939471 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
939472 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
939473 pakistans federally administered tribal areas fata are wilder than the wild west because al qaeda has resurfaced here in the form of a new breed of taliban who are threatening both afghanistan and pakistan
939474 it is imperative to understand how this has happened if we are to combat extremism
939475 for more than a year american intelligence reports have indicated that al qaeda is rebuilding in the tribal areas of pakistan however organizing counterterrorism programs has proven to be complicated for a variety of reasons including anti pakistani government sentiments in the federally administered tribal areas fata as well as growing jihadi ideals among the people
939476 only by retrieving the arrow and straightening its jagged edges and twisted feathers can muslims aspire to attain those high ethical values which are the embodiment of faith iman based on submission to god islam
939477 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

939479 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
939480 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
939481 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
939482 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
939483 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
939484 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
939485 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
939486 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
939487 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
939488 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
939489 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
939490 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
939491 ninety nine hundredths or possibly nine hundred and ninety nine thousandths of our activity is purely automatic and habitual from our rising in the morning to our lying down each night
939492 we are stereotyped creatures imitators and copiers of our past selves
939493 it is very important that teachers should realize the importance of habit
939494 the teachers prime concern should be to ingrain into the pupil that assortment of habits that shall be most useful to him throughout life education is for behavior and habits are the stuff of which behavior consists
939495 could the young but realize how soon they will become mere walking bundles of habits they would give more heed to their conduct while in the plastic state
939496 we must make automatic and habitual as early as possible as many useful actions as we can
939497 in the acquisition of a new habit or the leaving off of an old one we must take care to launch ourselves with as strong and decided an initiative as possible
939498 seize the very first possible opportunity to act on every resolution you make and on every emotional prompting you may experience in the direction of the habits you aspire to gain
939499 do every day or two something for no other reason than its difficulty
939500 never suffer an exception to occur till the new habit is securely rooted in your life
939501 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
939502 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
939503 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
939504 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
939505 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
939506 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
939507 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

939554 the deputy premier and i are here to make a short statement and we will not be taking questions afterwards
939555 i have spoken with a member of paula wriedts family this afternoon and i need to inform the public of recent events
939556 paula was taken to the royal hobart hospital by ambulance a short while ago as the result of an undisclosed medical emergency
939557 i am not in a position to speculate on the nature of her admission
939558 however i have received advice that she will require a period of treatment and recuperation
939559 it is clear that in the short term paula will be unable to perform her duties as a minister
939560 she needs to focus on getting well with the support of her family and friends
939561 my first and only priority in these circumstances is paulas health and wellbeing and that of her family
939562 in the interim i will be undertaking her portfolio roles
939563 i have offered paulas family my personal support and that of the government
939564 i will respect their right to make a decision on further comments regarding her condition
939565 i would appeal to the media to show appropriate restraint

939664 all you have to do is set up a bulletin board and the web provides order and stability
939665 you control membership and kick out time wasters at any time there are at least a dozen sites operating and if you divide the traffic a big part of it is transactional buying and selling hacked databases counterfeit credit cards and drivers licences
939666 another aspect of the traffic is recruitment they bring kids in or find high level partners with different capabilities and then theres knowledge sharing the criminals are better at sharing knowledge than any u s government i have worked with
939667 by early 2003 things were rolling we saw sites like the brotherhood of carders 8 600 user accounts as well buying and selling information hacked out of the system but there was no resource more responsible than carderplanet
939668 carderplanet had 7 000 active users from may 2001 and by august 2004 was the most reliable source for every criminal goods or service available on the internet the russian speaking community the ukraine belarus and the baltic communities are unmatched as a source for financial crime and no other community comes close
939669 one guy had completed 25 deals with a 100 positive feedback rating they have adopted rankings unabashedly

939684 if you think about how an operating system is loaded
939685 its loaded onto a hard disk physically located on that machine
939686 the operating system is tied very tightly to that hardware
939687 midori is one of many incubation projects underway at microsoft its simply a matter of being too early in the incubation to talk about it
939688 the real savings are around physical management of the devices and associated licensing
939689 within the microsoft environment we have struggled for years with applications that are written so poorly that they will not work with others
939690 virtualising this gives you a couple of new ways to tackle those traditional problems
939691 on the desktop we are seeing people place great value in being able to abstract the desktop from actual physical hardware
939692 people take their application the operating system they want to run it against package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client
939693 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that
939694 i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around
939695 they have used an old style skimming device they are skimming the card and copying the magnetic details

939698 this is a precautionary measure to protect the security of our customers transactions you can still pay for your fuel goods or services with your card by swipe and signature
939699 we will re introduce chip and pin as soon as it is possible we apologise to our customers if there has been any inconvenience caused
939700 in order to live you must be willing to die
939701 we are confident that this problem is specific to shell and the particular type of keypad that it uses but chip and pin keypads are supposed to shut down when tampered with so that part of the technology has obviously failed in this case we are working the manufacturer to ensure this doesnt happen again

939717 this team is built around a core of veteran players that bring a tremendous amount of international and olympic games experience with the addition of some very good young talent this team will be well balanced between speed power pitching and defense
939718 we look forward to our preparation and the challenges that the olympic games in beijing will bring with great excitement and anticipation
939719 the dress rehearsal is done and now were even more focused on the olympics
939720 we had a great tour this year with some of the best stops till 96 the local hosts held some great events and the communities really supported softball and thats great to see now we are on to why we are here to bring home a gold medal
939721 its very disappointing to know that were out for 2012 but for us the futures bright and our sport is at an all time high and well just keep pushing on and hope for 2016 to get it back in
939722 well yeah i think you know this team has grown from 2004 when we had a tremendous performance but i think they also realize that what happened in the past happened in the past and you got to do it again
939723 for us thats whats so special about wearing this usa uniform is to know the dominance that it has and the tradition of usa which is gold three gold medals so we definitely have a target on our back but that just makes us work harder
