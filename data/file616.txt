6160001 we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries across the oceans across the mountains across the prairies because we are made of sugar candy
6160002 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6160003 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around

6160005 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure

6160018 only the latin american and the asia pacific regions believe their clients will be expanding more internationally so this certainly indicates the optimism of emerging markets and a potential change in global business and advertising
6160019 because it was devoted to the actual tactics as the cia people were demanding a golden shield that would protect them from later prosecutions and only a memo approving specific tactics could do that
6160020 he read and was horrified by torture memos after he was put in charge of the olc and long before he wrote the transfer memo he is convicted out of his own mouth
6160021 his goldsmiths admission that he read the second still secret memo that detailed specific interrogation techniques being used by the cia makes it flatly impossible that he did not know or suspect what was going on when he wrote the transfer memo
6160022 was used to facilitate the ghost detainee program in which various prisoners were hidden from the international red cross so that nobody would learn that they were prisoners
6160023 and contrary to the geneva conventions i gather their status health and whereabouts were not disclosed to their families
6160024 by not formally accusing them in any judicial way we could according to goldsmith transfer them out of iraq because formally they were not yet accused persons although in fact our government had already accused and convicted them every way but sideways this is true dissembling this is true reliance on minimal form over gigantic substance and this is exactly what jack goldsmith did in his memo of march 19 2004

6160026 goldsmith was an enabler of evil including evil and crime justified by the tortured rationalizations of lawyers who set out to provide legal cover for torture for cruelly inhuman conduct and other horrors
6160027 whether lawyers in order to justify and provide a basis for supporting vicious and illegal actions of the government are free to assert the most outlandish arguments in favor of these actions are free to invent astonishing even evil arguments in favor of the positions are free to facilitate the governments evil actions and not to counsel against the positions even though the positions and actions are in violation of domestic criminal laws in violation of international law contrary to the american constitutional system and taken without consideration of the traditions and values of this country
6160028 gravely illegal conduct in this way would be subject to disbarment subject to criminal prosecution and disqualified from being on any respectable law school faculty

6160078 at the corner position isaac madison is playing pretty good he has his days where he has his ups and downs but hes been playing pretty consistently he has to improve on his tackling we need our corners to tackle and they have to be able to play both phases love was a situation where we felt he wasnt playing up to his expectations that we feel so we had to make that move
6160079 so its a matter of do you deal with the growing pains
6160080 how long do you do that before you feel comfortable possibly going back to that next guy if he showed us he wanted to be that type of football player a physical smart tough football player
6160081 its not like he means to do things wrong so hes just got to learn certain things where he needs to be and trust his speed knowing that if he keys and stops and runs at it the physical part is going to show up

6160131 the underlying problem is that democrats care about means as well as ends while republicans care almost exclusively about ends and will use any means to get there the paradox lies deeper for most democrats the means are part of the ends we want an electoral process that eschews the lying and cheating weve witnessed since richard nixons dirty tricks if we use their tactics we undermine our own goal violating one of the very things that distinguishes us from them yet if we dont stoop to their level how can we prevail in a system that allows even rewards such lying and cheating

6160162 it is that more than his divorce from om that is in his mind at the moment

6160233 i was trying to win gold but the main focus was not coming away with nothing
6160234 there was a lot of pumping going down and no time to breathe throughout the race i was just destroyed at the end
6160235 thankfully the guys behind me werent able to catch me i thought they were going to at one stage but i held on
6160236 i was stressing the whole race i was never confident in sailing conditions like today anything could happen
6160237 i was a little bit emotional but not as much as i expected ive been on verge of tears for the last 24 hours but the relief of winning killed a bit of that
6160238 all through last night and this morning i was pretty nervous it was a pretty stressful day and a stressful race
6160239 nick shouted a little bit and made it look closer than it was but it wasnt an issue he had a bit of nerves and made a bigger deal of it than it should have been and i figured that stage he was broken and struggling a little bit
6160240 in the end i decided to let the israeli guy go and concentrate on covering the french and british guys
6160241 obviously a very bright boy as hes computing a lot as he goes along
6160242 i had followed windsurfing through barbara kendall and aaron mcintosh but my plan had been to go laser sailing i guess it was a push into the sport but not in a pushy way i just loved it straight away its a really fantastic sport
6160243 this has gone as well as it could have gone but i dont know if ill be carrying on i do love what i do but id really like to go to university to study law at some stage and my nature is to be all or nothing so if i did that id want to give it 100 per cent

6160278 the main thing for us now is that we just need to play some games the team is really ready to play outside competition and find out where we are at they came in a week early on their own so they have been here for three weeks now and they are getting edgy to play there is no doubt that we are playing two very good teams in tough road environments but i dont think there is any better way to start out and really gauge our progress to this point
6160279 i think we have taken the first steps in laying a good foundation we have the right intentions we have prepared the physical and mental parts and we have a good teamwork attitude now it is just a question of honing our skills from a soccer standpoint developing our competitive muscles and getting the new faces some game experience
6160280 we want to win games make the ncaas and win our conference which is what everyone aspires to but we want to play good soccer and educate our fans while doing so we want to play a style of soccer that they can enjoy and we want to help grow our sport we go into every season ready to do that and we put ourselves on the line by doing so these ideas will once again be at the forefront of what we are doing on and off the field this year
6160281 what makes lower back injuries difficult but not impossible to prevent is that the majority of these injuries are not the result of a catastrophic accident such as a fall or a major accident but rather a cumulative injury the result of years of repetitive or awkward movement such as bending lifting twisting and carrying combined with using ill fitting or inappropriate tools and equipment a lifetime of poor ergonomic practices making the worker fit the job instead of the job fitting the worker

6160349 sometimes a big ado is made about a difference that is mathematically real and demonstrable but so tiny as to have no importance this is in defiance of the fine old saying that a difference is a difference only if it makes a difference
6160350 how large should the test groups be to get statistically significant results
6160351 is that really a large enough sample to yield significant results

6160365 most of the 172 people aboard are feared dead after a plane veered off the runway at madrids barajas airport officials said
6160366 hes going to make his announcement when he is ready to make his announcement
6160367 the coverage of it will be big because it is all you guys have asked about for five days
6160368 both of them definitely will not make their next start
6160369 he said he was going to text me as soon as he got the results
6160370 when you see him throwing the way he did when he first got here to the way he is now you know theres something going on
6160371 right now theyre treating it as dead arm so ill take a couple days off and get some life back in it
6160372 he can go long for us and he can be that bridge guy to get you from the fifth to the seventh so he is valuable in that role
6160373 no decisions have been made but i do like him in that role
6160374 the big news is that i went 20 minutes in bp with the people in the dugouts broadcasters getting ready i was the oldest guy out there i leave it up to others to say how i did
6160375 in the history of our federation we have never had a better hitter
6160376 we dont have to shut down baseball to do it
6160377 what weve heard from the players is they want to be in it
6160378 in 1992 when baseball was added there was no requirement to use major league players
6160379 since 1992 baseball has moved from amateur athletes to professional athletes
6160380 you have to remember we are not just talking about only major league baseball in the usa were talking about professional baseball in japan and other countries as well and of course cuba they have their best players here
6160381 even my wife called me youre dealing with an emotional situation involving young players thinking about it again nobody would do it im a little disappointed but you have to learn these players have to learn that you cant do that
6160382 look at some of the other sports that are here these people build up to competition not just for four years but their whole life that aggressive behavior is what some people want so you can understand that when i was at the air force academy one problem with some football players that aggressiveness you want on the field worked when you were a cadet on training missions but doesnt work if youre beating up roommates
6160383 the only reason a few of mine are 0 is because of decay not lack of a rating
6160384 the only reason a few of mine are 0 is because of gt decay not lack of a rating
6160385 yes ive been tracking the decay of my own creatures and the decay is a lot slower than i originally thought
6160386 a lot of the procedural issues necessary for instant replay to be implemented need to be worked out
6160387 major league baseball needs to step up to the plate and iron out these issues
6160388 im not going to go through these one by one i will tell you that on a number of them the comments are simply not accurate
6160389 for example weve had an understanding with the wua for some time that the crew chief and the crew chief only would be the one responsible for reviewing the video and making the decision on instant replay
6160390 there are other issues that remain to be worked out it is my general policy that i dont comment when im trying to bargain but i remain confident that were going to be able to make a deal
6160391 thus there will be a lack of transparency and obviousness for the public as to what is going on when instant replay is under way
6160392 there may be situations where the umpires will have to leave the field in shifts so that everyone can view the video while leaving the requisite number of umpires on the field
6160393 this could create a laurel and hardy effect and may cause delay of game problems
6160394 he doesnt trust the teams to behave themselves in their absence
6160395 the umpires raised concerns and brought potential problems to solomons attention at least six weeks ago
6160396 the stomatal density and index of early devonian gt carboniferous and early permian plants has been gt investigated to test for any relationship that they gt may show with the changes in atmospheric co2 gt concentration derived from physical gt evidence over that period observed changes in the gt stomatal data give support to the suggestion from gt physical evidence that atmospheric co2 gt concentrations fell from an early devonian high of gt 10 12 times its present value to one comparable to gt that of the present day by the end of the gt carboniferous

6160402 that can be quite a time consuming laborious process and we created this really simple program that anyone should be able to operate

6160612 positioned voxeo in the visionaries quadrant of its magic quadrant for ivr systems and enterprise voice portals 2008 report
6160613 i would again like to thank our developers enterprise customers channel partners and oem licensees for the business they have closed with voxeo over the last eight years
6160614 unlike vendors that increasingly create channel conflict in an attempt to grab as much revenue as possible voxeo remains diligently focused on the success of our partners and licensees as a result voxeo has the highest customer retention rate in our industry and is growing profitably at a pace unmatched in almost any industry
6160615 magic quadrant for interactive voice response systems and enterprise voice portals 2008
6160616 upon reviewing the current environment and the opportunities that may unfold from government regulation and policies retaining separate identities for the enterprise and consumer sides of the business will likely benefit the company in terms of licensing growth and expansion areas such as voice over internet protocol in the domestic market being opened up and the new spectrum policy that is to be announced are opportunities that could benefit the company going forwards we believe the company will be better positioned to seize opportunities given the current regulatory policy landscape by deferring the merger
6160617 despite the recent dip in gas prices significant auto rebates still exist on many larger vehicles the nissan armada beat the toyota land cruiser on the strength of a 5 000 rebate and the nissan quests 3 500 rebate makes it top in the minivan class
6160618 an interesting fact is nissan has quietly mentioned that the armada may not continue production after early 2010 that is an indication of the new reality of this market and its impact on small cars
6160619 lots of families are looking to make the switch to small cars and its noteworthy that the toyota corolla and toyota yaris two of the top smallest cars in our ranking and highly respected both carry rebates that demonstrates once again how important it is for buyers to do their homework you never know where the deals might be especially in this buyers market
6160620 the chevy silverado has been a solid presence on the best deals lists for months
6160621 however we expect to see the close outs of the 2008 dodge ram and 2008 ford f150 impact these classes as their all new 2009 models roll into the market later this year
6160622 responsible management of the water cycle has global implications as water resources become scarcer
6160623 business government and other interested stakeholders must be in a position to invest in infrastructure and technology to provide clean water and to educate citizens on the importance of clean water and sanitation the benefits of sustainable water management will be felt across society and around the world through healthier populations and stronger economies its critical that all key stakeholders maintain an ongoing dialogue to ensure efficient use of financial and natural resources to bring clean water and sanitation to more people

6160672 today the republican leaders in the house are sending a letter to 22 of our democrat colleagues who say they want more energy yet they continue to vote with speaker pelosi to block our all of the above plan they cant have it both ways either they are for more energy and are willing to vote that way or theyre not and were basically calling on them to put up or shut up make sure that youre saying the same thing at home that you are saying here in washington d c and reminding them that actions speak louder than words
6160673 it is very clear that my constituents whether they be in agriculture financial national security at fort bragg the epicenter of the military universe whoever im talking to they want the all of the above american energy act passed now their question is you hear from the new leadership and by the way the democrats are in charge and have been for 18 months since gas has gone up 2 10 a gallon why dont they do something and thats a great question we have not been called back and it does not look like we will be called back but i would certainly hope that we would if were not when we do come back the all american energy act which does all of the above produces the capital that we need to fully develop alternative sources of energy responds to the needs of our people who need jobs and a growing economy thats what im asking the democrat leadership nancy pelosi to do for the good of the american people

6160680 for that reason it is not appropriate for him to comment publicly
6160681 she was the most delicate pretty innocent naive person you could ever meet
6160682 the first person i spoke to positively identified kerry they described what she was wearing and said she was carrying a cat carry cage
6160683 then it was just a matter of getting police there
6160684 i dont think im brave i was just convinced that what had happened wasnt right
6160685 you couldnt meet a more kind and compassionate person than kerry
6160686 we believe that a major factor in the funds historical valuation premium was its high distribution yield and that the recent erosion of that premium was due to the uncertainty over its distribution policy
6160687 as a low dividend paying growth corporation we expect it will be more difficult to attract the same premium as many investors do not value future growth potential as highly as current income
6160688 conversion may expand the funds investor base and could provide increased access to the debt and equity markets through a listing on the new york stock exchange but both could have been accomplished without cutting the distribution dividend rate our concern is that the distribution cut will increase the trusts cost of capital and make it more difficult to complete accretive acquisitions

6160696 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6160697 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6160698 really source of proof please science observation proves you wrong and a habitual chronic pathological liar as well
6160699 on june 12 1980 a third explosive eruption produced 25 feet of stratification that amazed geologists successive layers are traditionally thought to require long periods of time to form yet upwards of 100 layers accumulated mostly between the nighttime hours of 9 and 12 while a plume swiftly ascended nine miles above the mountain wave after wave of pyroclastic flows began hurtling out of the crater and down the north slope each dusting the valley below with another lamination measuring from a fraction of an inch to over a yard in thickness each took from a few seconds to a few minutes to form
6160700 geologist steven austin described these pyroclastic flows as ground hugging fluidized turbulent slurries of fine volcanic debris they moved down the mountainside at hurricane speeds and left deposits of 1000 degrees f one would expect each deposit to be homogenized amp thoroughly mixed remarkably these high velocity slurries of red hot ash and pumice separated into coarse and fine particles of perfectly defined layers such features follow laws governing flows demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks
6160701 similar thin layering appears in the tapeats sandstones of the grand canyon
6160702 yup you could explain to me that you have observed first hand the layering in your septic tank too im sure there is an analogy here but it escapes me at the moment do tell what is the connection
6160703 i suppose you did read darwins radio your choice of reading materials reveals a lot dawkins specialties are fiction and fantasy not observable science his much acclaimed among fools weasel analogy was a complete fraud youre clutching at fables in a last ditch effort to avoid the conclusion that there is a god to whom you will answer one day youre not ready for that
6160704 hey bj antibiotics kill bacteria not viruses you cant kill viruses with antibiotics and viruses dont mutate in response to antibiotics theyre unaffected sheesh i would have thought you would get it the first time you were corrected your knowledge of science is pathetic and youre a very dense slow learner
6160705 so we have layer upon layer fair enough of varying thicknesses of pyroclastic flows why is that such a big deal and yet again i gave to remind you that such layers are not sedimentary
6160706 yah and bears make big potty in the woods so what are you still beating that one trick pony i regret to inform you but your hobbyhorse is dead
6160707 are you a complete freaking idjit the point is that the aggregates were not only layered but segregated according to aggregate size what you have at msh is 25 feet of finely layered segregated aggregates laid down in 3 hours not a long series of separate volcanic eruptions one ringy dingy two ringy dingy if you cant comprehend the material go back to the nursery and retrieve your binky
6160708 for anyone who just tuned in see 7 wonders of mount st helens
6160709 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6160710 they maybe layered but they formed as a result of volcanic activity so they are not sedimentary rocks sorry for shouting but hopefully it may sink in eventually
6160711 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6160712 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen this presents a problem if you believe in uniformism and evolution
6160713 actually crime is on the rise especially rape and murder it may still be low but for countries with small populations its a drastic increase on top of that scandinavia in particular norway has cultivated and spawned some powerful anti religious movements the black metal movement that grew to infamy in the 1990s hit the national newspapers with almost one hundred church burnings and espoused a venomously anti christian doctrine its adherents worshipped odin the norse gods and satan they wanted not only the continued decline of christianity but a revival of nordic paganism in addition scandinavia has a healthy population of laveyan satanists so there still religious the just don t follow the bible paganism has always been in scandinavian countries and its been on a sharp rise in the last 20 years santa clause is worshipped every year all over the world santa came from the scandinavian religions of old so there quite religious just not christian
6160714 why would i do that the bible goes all the way back to creation its not given by an angel of light
6160715 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6160716 your density amazes me both gas charged slurries which formed the msh strata and water charged slurries which formed the tapeats strata follow the same laws of physics i e they follow laws governing flows of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks the volcano has demonstrated that such formations can be formed rapidly a global flood would have produced tapeats in a brief time
6160717 the difference is that this demonstration of the behavior of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris at msh was a gas charged slurry while the flood was primarily a demonstration of the behavior and end results of water charged slurries on a much more massive scale the flood also involved the laying down of volcanic debris but the whole demonstration was inundated with water for a year so what happens when volcanic debris is thoroughly mixed with other types of aggregates and subjected to the conditions that have already been demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks hm m m m would you not get the rapid formation of a great number of segregated layers of sedimentary rock in a very short period of time good grief man the ancient romans used volcanic sand and ash to make concrete doesnt that tell you anything
6160718 you also said they were living matter which they are not now that is an interesting hypothesis viruses which are not alive mutate therefore proving evolution in living things somebody help me with this i swear that somewhere i read that the flatworm was evolving faster than the human my thought then why are they still flatworms
6160719 red bloods cells in a 65 million year old fossil
6160720 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive
6160721 one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life
6160722 modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen
6160723 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6160724 no the simple answer is that the drawings are based upon fear of the afterlife and legend
6160725 i would expect that from someone who is simple minded
6160726 red bloods cells in a 65 million year old fossil
6160727 oh boy you actually think you got me on that one did i ever imply that she was a creationist in fact i am glad she is not because if she were a creationist then oh boy how simple it would be to dismiss her discovery get it indeed i like the fact that she is not doh the point of the post was despite the evidence scientists will simply dismiss it its not oh well we should look at our dating methods its like we have to reevaluate how fossilization occurs oh we know this is 80 million years old because of the layer huh so after knocking down your straw man how do explain her discovery
6160728 the rocks turned out to be ancient burial stones that the inca indians placed with their dead almost one third of the stones depicted specific types of dinosaurs such as triceratops and stegosaurus and various pterosaurs the type of art form represented by these stones and their location dated them to the time of the inca culture c a d 500 1500 how could these ancient indians have known the anatomy of these creatures if they never had witnessed them firsthand
6160729 interestingly several diplodocus like dinosaurs on the stones have what appear to be dermal frills something never previously reported by scientists
6160730 also the skin of many of the carved dinosaurs resembled bumpy rosettes
6160731 again we must ask how could the incas have drawn such accurate pictures of dinosaurs if they never had seen the animals or had them described by someone who had seen them
6160732 see above in other words why are you so easily dismissing them as mere mythical creatures as i keep saying believe in this stuff and you must also believe in the hydra
6160733 yeah right if its one thing that a scientist wants is the respect of his peers
6160734 there is no evidence against evolution thats not my view in the slightest i simply dont take adaptation and mutation to be evidence for it
6160735 dinosaur soft tissue sequenced similar to chicken proteins http news nationalgeographic com news 2007 04 070412 dino tissues 2 html now look at that now is it so easy to dismiss finding soft tissue in dinosaur bones if you believe that it supports your belief well no you probably believe that birds are descended from dinosaurs thus it proves true
6160736 to me it seems still that while it can prove the 2 may have been related i still simply dont believe soft tissue could survive 65 million years
6160737 on another note though i be a creationist i am not a new earther

6160768 we will leverage existing and emerging strengths in the sciences education business and the allied health professions to expand our research portfolio in selected areas in which our faculty is likely to have a significant impact
6160769 universities are social institutions with a responsibility to the public we serve
6160770 the public demands that we also focus on their needs and engage directly in creating knowledge necessary to solve the many pressing problems of our society
6160771 i can go proudly back to my hometown and tell my people that i have not let them down their dream came true and my goal was achieved
6160772 it showed the improvement of the overall level of chinese sailing
6160773 the medal race was really classic and it will be definitely recorded into the history of chinese sailing
6160774 it was a dream of the girls to win an olympic medal for the first time and now they have
6160775 it is a breakthrough for china in this weight category because no chinese have won a gold in this before
6160776 i have been waiting for this day for a long time
6160777 weve finished our journey for the olympic games its a shame we were going to break the record for china at the olympics to take seventh or sixth place but we didnt make it
6160778 i have a great feeling its a dream come true
6160779 im shocked i have been aspiring to the world record for so long i never expected this i knew the track was a fast track but i didnt think this was possible
6160780 i was worried but i told myself to leave everything on the track
6160781 i had come here to do it and im so happy with myself
6160782 i worked so hard to become the champion and i will work harder to stay on top
6160783 the guy came out and made the best olympics of my lifetime
6160784 to me bolt is like what michael phelps is to swimming
6160785 i dont think his training has been geared to that part yet
6160786 but in a few years it will be and then i will be ready to kiss my record goodbye
6160787 im not going to minimize the gravity of concern that i have over the budget for the rest of this year and for the following three years
6160788 this demonstrates that all the legislative leaders and all the legislators and senators voting on bills recognize the fiscal impact of this state revenues falling off the cliff from wall street
6160789 we have established a cushion thats approaching 500 million to tide us over into next years budget
6160790 in the end everybody that is a new yorker should be in a shared sacrifice mode for the next couple of years
6160791 we are not celebrating here we are partnering and we are very enthused about our ability to work and cooperate with each other there is nothing to celebrate we have got a lot more work to do
6160792 i dont know where the carr story has come from i can categorically say no to that one
6160793 i keep hearing the brown rumour but theres nothing in it in fact i dont see us doing anything before the transfer window shuts
6160794 these are the issues that they want us to deal with you will see us dealing with some of these issues as we come back in september
6160795 we have been working pretty closely together on georgia and issues related to afghanistan
6160796 the article he wrote in the guardian was an article that any member of the cabinet could have written or i could have written these are debates that all members of the cabinet have got to be involved in
6160797 the impact on the energy market has been significant as demonstrated by the momentous jump in gas and electricity prices the amount of gas available to export from norway to countries including the uk will be cut significantly and without adequate storage the uk will be left to negotiate with russia and the far east for supplies or risk running low on energy

6160821 algebra doesnt have to be difficult to learn or teach especially when we begin introducing these concepts at an early age
6160822 preparing all students for success in algebra at grade 8 requires a strong early algebra curriculum as well as a curriculum that focuses on developing concepts and skills involving fractions too many students find algebra challenging because of a poor background in fractions envisionmath develops the essential understandings and skills related to fractions needed for success in algebra
6160823 algebra concepts and skills need not be mysterious to teachers or students when they are taught with a focus on sense making furthermore all teachers can successfully teach algebra and all students can successfully learn algebra when teaching and learning are guided by envisionmath
6160824 our elementary grades program reflects the latest research about learning mathematics and already fills a void from an old model that essentially no longer exists
6160825 envisionmath sets a new standard in laying this crucial early foundation for success
6160826 one of the other critical programs we are offering for california is an algebra readiness fixed term course for eighth grade students who are not yet prepared for algebra 1
6160827 virtually all of the research in recent years confirms that in order for our students to compete in the global 21st century economy they simply must improve significantly in their understanding of math concepts and skills
6160828 mathematics is a significant obstacle for many students but this can no longer be acceptable
6160829 algebra readiness is clearly the area where we believe school districts will see the biggest impact for the money they decide to spend on new programs
6160830 it is discouraging that the state budget deficit is keeping some school districts from implementing these new programs at a time when they are most needed
6160831 middle school is what you might call the bermuda triangle of education because a significant percentage of californias kids fall behind and eventually drop out of school at this level
6160832 by focusing on algebra readiness with innovative research based programs with built in intervention and assessment we can not only do a better job of retaining students but also give them the skills and confidence to realize that they can be successful in math

6160839 this new poll reinforces that a clear majority of americans be they democrats independents or republicans want policies like the employee free choice act that will help working families struggling in this economy push polls released by anti union corporate front groups earlier this year have tried to indicate otherwise but this new poll shows the true pulse of the american public momentum for the employee free choice act is real and while anti union corporations and their front groups are spending millions to mislead the public americans arent buying it

6160857 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
6160858 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
6160859 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
6160860 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
6160861 i know theres no one who knows the subject matter that hes going to have to deal with better than john
6160862 his attitude toward the environment at pennfuture has been very angry
6160863 i think id characterize some of his views as extreme
6160864 theres no one i trust more than mary jo white in striking a balance
6160865 helped shape bills that were both tremendously positive for pennsylvania businesses and at the same time good for our environment
6160866 he starts off with some positives and starts off with a few negatives but i think he can work his way toward confirmation
6160867 i know exactly the difference between being an advocate in the private sector and having a public responsibility
6160868 whats important is working hard listening to everyone considering different views and trying to arrive at fair productive answers
6160869 view of economic development is through regulation litigation and taxation theyve supported so many taxes against our members i think the appointment is a concern for us
6160870 were certainly hopeful that the secretary designate despite the constituency he most recently represented will be able to shift gears and represent a broader constituency that includes us
6160871 all of these things are just incredibly expensive to the public while yielding almost no environmental benefit
6160872 if you cant compete with petroleum at 120 a barrel you cant compete
6160873 the whole concept of state government playing around in venture capital is nonsense
6160874 i think hes done an excellent job leading pennfuture and i think hell transfer all that experience and passion to his new position
6160875 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6160876 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6160877 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6160878 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6160879 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6160880 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6160881 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6160882 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6160883 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6160884 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6160885 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6160886 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6160887 west kentuckys proximity to fort campbell and the nashville area makes it a prime location to provide better employment opportunities for our citizens
6160888 a new approach to job creation education and economic growth is essential to improving kentuckys position in the global marketplace and through this initiative the west kentucky workforce investment board has made that commitment to the citizens it serves
6160889 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6160890 ive looked down the barrel of an m 16 at an enemy of our nation put him in my sights and squeezed the trigger you never have and anyone anyone who thinks ill do any less to our enemies today knows nothing about who i really am
6160891 how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake
6160892 we see tru2way as a great technology for cable boxes and a great technology for retail
6160893 we think one of the strengths of it for consumers is that they can buy retail products that use the same technology as the cable industry
6160894 this is a landmark agreement which will provide a national open and interactive platform resulting in more choices of services and products for consumers
6160895 we are pleased that this technical challenge has been addressed through a voluntary private sector solution
6160896 we look forward to working with our cable colleagues to ensure americans across the country have access to high value cable content while using the equipment of their choosing
6160897 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6160898 there are droughts in north and south carolina parts of california most of new zealand and this idiot who firmly believes he can induce rain by prayer is wasting it by asking his lord and savior to play a political prank its not boyish humor and youre a selfish hypocrite
6160899 the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
6160900 following the lead of political families like the strogers and lipinskis illinois senate president emil jones is anointing one of his children to take over for him when he retires in january
6160901 his preference yes would be to see his son serve
6160902 in rural minnesota one district is skipping classes every monday to save fuel nationwide at least 14 other districts are switching to four day weeks and dozens more are considering it
6160903 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
6160904 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up

6160908 a man being suspended in the air by six metal hooks clamped to his skin during an act at a tattoo convention fell and broke a leg
6160909 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6160910 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6160911 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6160912 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6160913 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6160914 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6160915 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6160916 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6160917 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6160918 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6160919 a girl came up to me on the street and she almost smacked me
6160920 the only thing i remember is we both went down swingin and we called it a draw
6160921 a girl came up to me on the street and she almost smacked me
6160922 the only thing i remember is we both went down swingin and we called it a draw
6160923 their friends are quite pleased that theyre getting back together and are trying to give them pitt damon mcadams front load toronto fest
6160924 this is an historic step for both comcast and panasonic in delivering to consumers a product that gives them a far more expansive benefit as a comcast customer
6160925 consumers have told us they want easy and convenient access to all the great content comcast provides and the anyplay p dvr does that
6160926 culver raises taxes and spends more money and wants to use your tax dollars to benefit microsoft
6160927 the determination was made that it did not violate the state campaign laws because it did not expressly advocate for or against gov culver or a clearly identified candidate for office the issue the board is now looking at is whether any of the state lobbying laws were triggered
6160928 it purports to be exempt from tax under section 501 c 4 of the internal revenue code but its notion of promoting the social welfare is to send valentines to electorally troubled republican senate candidates the commission should take immediate steps to enforce the law and expose this groups secret financing to light of day
6160929 an organization that is careful about how it writes the script of its ad can fly under the radar or stay outside of the net of campaign finance activity
6160930 call norm coleman and thank him for his agenda for minnesota
6160931 i think there would be an opening for someone who wanted to prosecute a group who is spending millions of dollars on advertising
6160932 that is evident by the things that are prominently displayed on our web site and in our work
6160933 call democratic sen harry reid and tell him to allow a vote
6160934 for far too long the left has been on the field with no opposition
6160935 american future fund has said its time to play ball were not going to sit on the sidelines any longer its important for free market conservative principles to be highlighted in public and thats what we intend to do
6160936 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6160937 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6160938 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6160939 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6160940 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6160941 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6160942 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6160943 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6160944 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6160945 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6160946 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6160947 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6160948 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6160949 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6160950 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6160951 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6160952 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6160953 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6160954 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6160955 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6160956 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6160957 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6160958 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6160959 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6160960 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6160961 there is no longer this widespread belief among the wise guys and gals of both parties that were all just sitting around waiting for this race to break in obamas direction the polls as well as the money race suggest otherwise
6160962 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
6160963 flomax case study evolving disease state awareness to succeed with new method of action
6160964 if your case is currently being worked on stay put put off your move till its done
6160965 with todays uncertain economy some firms are relying on a cost cutting strategy to ride out the storm other firms are taking advantage of the current environment to exploit new markets win greater market share and spur organic growth the faculty for this summit will provide you with up to the minute strategies you can use to turn todays uncertainty into competitive advantage

6160975 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
6160976 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
6160977 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
6160978 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
6160979 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
6160980 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance
6160981 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
6160982 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
6160983 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
6160984 they did it to massachusetts sen john kerry they did it to former vice president al gore they tried to do it to former president clinton they did it to former massachusetts gov michael dukakis
6160985 thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern they know how to run a negative campaign
6160986 in order for us to win we not only have to beat the attack machine weve got to win back the trust of the american people
6160987 the same guys that brought you george bush are now trying to bring you john mccain theyve basically got the same strategy which is they cant win an argument on ideas so what theyre going to do is theyre going to try to attack me
6160988 this may not be directly affiliated with the campaign but you know suddenly magically you got the same guy who wrote unfit for command
6160989 he comes out with a new book saying that im a nut
6160990 in the term of the next president skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
6160991 unless you are in the top one tenth of 1 in this country you are not better off than you were four years ago or eight years ago
6160992 its because of that experience that when i hear that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and were not seeing the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad and i get frustrated
6160993 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
6160994 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
6160995 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
6160996 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
6160997 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
6160998 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
6160999 the roman catholic church which was supposed to carry the light of the gospel plunged the world into the dark ages
6161000 john paul ii will be remembered for staring down communism and embracing people of all faiths and colors
6161001 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6161002 you cant implificate me this time im up to my floppy ears in afghanistan trying to pacificate those presidentless folks over there
6161003 shoot i concoctified katrina to guarantee me one more term in office i did not have sex with that woman ms nature im still experimentating on a secret mass amnesia event that will allow me to sorta reintroducify myself as the next american messiah that way i can get reelected all over gain for the first time ive codenamed the project operation forget me not no wait operation forget me no wait oh just forget it
6161004 crear una atmosfera necess ria i gaudir amb tots els esdeveniments culturals que ens envolten i alhora descobrir propostes silenciades fins ara
6161005 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6161006 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6161007 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6161008 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6161009 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6161010 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6161011 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6161012 trying to make excuses or to yell about my articles
6161013 americans end up getting bad information and supporting bad decisions and strategies
6161014 i think when you get so distant from the facts as as guys like limbaugh and sean hannity do yeah i think that tends to corrupt the dialogue
6161015 defend and explain one example where i said something that was so false
6161016 youre not listening susan youve got to learn something he saddam had weapons of mass destruction he promised to disclose them and he didnt do it you would have let him go free we decided to hold him accountable
6161017 and kay had also not discovered any chemical or biological weapons
6161018 colin powell just had a great piece that he had in the paper today he was there in iraq he said things couldnt have been better
6161019 iraq has come very far but serious problems remain starting with security american commanders and troops told me of the many threats they face from leftover loyalists who want to return iraq to the dark days of saddam from criminals who were set loose on iraqi society when saddam emptied the jails and increasingly from outside terrorists who have come to iraq to open a new front in their campaign against the civilized world
6161020 and in northern iraq today this very day al qaeda is operating camps there and they are attacking the kurds in the north and this has been well documented and well chronicled now if youre going to go after al qaeda in every aspect and obviously they have the support of saddam or were not
6161021 kay also called a speech where cheney made the claim there was a link to al qaeda
6161022 after 9 11 liberal democrats at first showed little interest in the investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure bush and his team made it clear that determining the causes of americas security failures and finding and remedying its weak points would be central to their mission
6161023 president bush took a few minutes during his trip to europe thursday to voice his opposition to establishing a special commission to probe how the government dealt with terror warnings before sept 11
6161024 first of all this president you know and i know and everybody knows inherited a recession it was by every definition a recession
6161025 the recession officially began in 2001 months after bush was sworn in according to the universally acknowledged arbiter of such things the national bureau of economic research and president bush at other times has also said so himself
6161026 the hispanic community got to know him bush in texas they went almost overwhelming for him he more than quadrupled the hispanic vote that he got in that state
6161027 look weve had these reports very disturbing reports and i have actually spoken to people that have confirmed a lot of the reports about the trashing of the white house when the clintons left the white house pornographic materials left in the printers they cut the phone lines lewd and crude messages on phone machines stripping of anything that was not bolted down on air force one 200 000 in furniture taken out
6161028 is it you hate this president or that you hate america
6161029 governor why wouldnt anyone want to say the pledge of allegiance unless they detested their own country or were ignorant of its greatness
6161030 you could explain something about your magazine the nation lisa featherstone writing about the hate america march the anti war march that took place over the weekend
6161031 i hate america this is the extreme left there is a portion of the left not everybody whos left that does hate this country and blame this country for the ills of the world
6161032 you dont like this country do you you think this is an evil country by your description of it right here you think its a bad country
6161033 it doesnt say anywhere in the constitution this idea of the separation of church and state
6161034 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
6161035 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
6161036 you want to refer to some liberal activist judge thats fine but im going to go directly to the source the author of the bill of rights james madison hired the first chaplain in 1789 and i gotta tell ya somethin i think the author of the bill of rights knows more about the original intent no offense to you and your liberal atheist activism knows more about it than you do
6161037 is the appointment of chaplains to the two houses of congress consistent with the constitution and with the pure principle of religious freedom in strictness the answer on both points must be in the negative
6161038 but the alabama constitution which chief justice roy moore is sworn to uphold clearly it says as a matter of fact that the recognition of god is the foundation of that states constitution
6161039 that no religion shall be established by law that no preference shall be given by law to any religious sect society denomination or mode of worship that no one shall be compelled by law to attend any place of worship nor to pay any tithes taxes or other rate for building or repairing any place of worship or for maintaining any minister or ministry that no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under this state and that the civil rights privileges and capacities of any citizen shall not be in any manner affected by his religious principles
6161040 betsy theyre not going to lose it public housing because if you work less than 30 hours a week if you work more than 30 hours a week you dont have to do it if youre between the ages of 18 and 62 and youre not legally disabled and you have free housing in other words
6161041 no wait a second sean let me correct you most people in public housing are not receiving free housing many of them are paying almost market rates
6161042 betsy that is so ridiculous and so false its hardly even worth spending the time
6161043 but he senator kerry wanted to cancel every major weapons system specific votes that he would have canceled the weapons systems we now use
6161044 in 1991 kerry opposed an amendment to impose an arbitrary 2 percent cut in the military budget in 1992 he opposed an amendment to cut pentagon intelligence programs by 1 billion in 1994 he voted against a motion to cut 30 5 billion from the defense budget over the next five years and to redistribute the money to programs for education and the disabled that same year he opposed an amendment to postpone construction of a new aircraft carrier in 1996 he opposed a motion to cut six f 18 jet fighters from the budget in 1999 he voted against a motion to terminate the trident ii missile
6161045 if he kerry had his way and the cia would almost be nonexistent
6161046 if only this picture had been published before the 2000 election gore would be president
6161047 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6161048 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
6161049 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
6161050 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6161051 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6161052 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6161053 the hardest thing for a first time candidate to do unless hes already particularly well known in the community for something hes done is to build name id
6161054 dont have to go through the months and months and months of introducing themselves to voters
6161055 an important thing to realize i think is that youre not starting necessarily from where you finished last cycle
6161056 the mistake a candidate can make who got very close last cycle is to assume they start at that point and all they need to do is make up for the 1 000 votes or the 3 000 votes or whatever it is theyre short
6161057 it might be easier to start off with a blank slate than to start off with a guy whos got very high negatives
6161058 theres nothing that will teach you to deal with the media better than dealing with the media you learn that its a bleeping hot stove and it will burn you if you put your hand on it
6161059 the issue matrix is so different this time around and i believe it certainly plays to my strength
6161060 last time kagen ran against the establishment and now he is the establishment
6161061 its kind of like a team that made it to the super bowl and loses but they have that experience of going very far and the next time theyre going to win it
6161062 it was an absolutely fabulous night for our statewide candidates
6161063 they all outperformed what our expectations could have been dino first and foremost
6161064 that blowhard needs to close his yap or lose his job
6161065 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6161066 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6161067 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6161068 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6161069 arsenals of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them
6161070 if we have to use force it is because we are america we see further into the future
6161071 best recruiting sergeant that the new anti americanism could have hoped for
6161072 obamas vice presidential choice will show a great deal about how he plans to run the rest of his race and how he will lead if elected
6161073 this choice is especially important since obama has this opportunity to fill a perceived weakness and experience gap with voters this worked well for george bush when he selected dick cheney
6161074 obama can make another type of choice to get elected by selecting a young vibrant running mate to emphasise change this worked for bill clinton with his selection of al gore
6161075 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
6161076 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
6161077 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
6161078 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
6161079 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
6161080 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6161081 they told me there are going to be resources here
6161082 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6161083 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6161084 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6161085 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6161086 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6161087 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6161088 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6161089 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6161090 sometimes when the team is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys tell them to go out there with all theyve got and win just one for the gipper
6161091 it has been finished for a while now i dont really know whats going on with it
6161092 the record industry is a very political place at the moment and i am on emi records lots of people have been fired or have taken redundancy recently as the company was taken over by a private equity firm called terra firma
6161093 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6161094 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6161095 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6161096 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6161097 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6161098 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6161099 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6161100 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
6161101 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
6161102 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
6161103 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
6161104 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
6161105 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6161106 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6161107 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6161108 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6161109 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6161110 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6161111 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6161112 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6161113 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6161114 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6161115 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6161116 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6161117 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6161118 since our initial investment in contec two years ago the company has performed well exceeding our expectations
6161119 we look forward to supporting the acquisition by bain capital and continuing our relationship with the contec management team through this additional investment in the companys debt
6161120 it has been a pleasure working with contec ceo gary stein and the rest of the contec team
6161121 contecs continual improvements efficiency and quality have set the standards for the industry
6161122 contec will continue to play a critical role in the communication and entertainment value chain
6161123 as the market continues to grow and become more and more complex contec is well positioned for future success
6161124 we are very pleased to have the opportunity to work with bain capital one of the worlds leading private equity firms for the first time on this transaction
6161125 our willingness to provide subordinated debt exemplifies our long term commitment to supporting contecs growth
6161126 perch quando preparo limpasto della focaccia al formaggio poi faccio fatica a tirarlo sottile en espa ol
6161127 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6161128 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6161129 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6161130 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6161131 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6161132 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6161133 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
6161134 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
6161135 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
6161136 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
6161137 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
6161138 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
6161139 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6161140 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6161141 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6161142 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6161143 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6161144 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6161145 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
6161146 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
6161147 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
6161148 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
6161149 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
6161150 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
6161151 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
6161152 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
6161153 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
6161154 im not going to go to that convention the republican convention and spend my time attacking barack obama
6161155 im going to go there really talking about why i support john mccain and why i hope a lot of other independents and democrats will do that and frankly im going to go to a partisan convention and tell them if i go why its so important that we start to act like americans and not as partisan mudslingers here in washington
6161156 the repubs dont want him and neither will the democrats
6161157 im not going to go to that convention the republican convention and spend my time attacking barack obama
6161158 i would just like to take a moment after being seriously sickened by reading about georgia russia and poland and personally thank all the hillary supporters voting for mccain being an ex republican i am absolutely disgusted with the direction this country is going but i have come to the realization that a country like ours is only as good as those people who are willing to be civically responsible so thank you puma and clinton mccain backers for the onslaught on ww iii economic depression and marshall law i realize of course that i am a bit premature in my gratitude but i have every confidence if any ignorant selfish people could pull off completely destroying this country and democracy it will be you hats off to the misguided uniformed and just dont give a darn population putin iran and osama are counting on you
6161159 the pentagon telecommunications centers mission is critical any disruption of service to the decision makers in the pentagon has the potential to impact mission operations worldwide
6161160 lockheed martin has been supporting the center for more than 10 years and we are proud to continue helping them plan for the future
6161161 grading the states a report on americas mental healthcare system for serious mental illnesses
6161162 this may well be a milestone in the treatment of hypophosphatasia
6161163 studies in a mouse model for hypophosphatasia show enb 0040 has the potential to greatly enhance the quality of life for patients
6161164 in preclinical studies using a mouse model enb 0040 consistently improved survival as well as bone and dental manifestations of hypophosphatasia the initiation of clinical studies brings us closer to the goal of providing drug therapy for hypophosphatasia patients where none currently exists
6161165 j d power and associates reported that airline passenger service is at a 3 year low and it is no wonder when airlines are creating a race to the bottom for front line service workers who perform critical safety security and service roles
6161166 whether were talking about carrying their legislation or doling out more subsidies congress shouldnt be doing any more favors for an airline industry that appears to show such contempt for the american public
6161167 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
6161168 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
6161169 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
6161170 these are top notch primary care physicians and we are delighted they have decided to join our organization
6161171 we look forward to working with them to support their care of patients in the milwaukee area
6161172 the resources and expertise available through aurora is what we want for our patients
6161173 aurora is a fully integrated health care provider unlike any other organization in wisconsin working as part of aurora we will be able to better coordinate patient care across a broad range of excellent services
6161174 we are proud of what we are achieving for our patients and the communities we serve
6161175 were also pleased that our innovative approach to providing health care is attracting so many excellent physicians to our organization
6161176 whoa youre looking at this web site with an iphone so im going to send you over here instead to an ever so special site that i made just for you
6161177 over the past eight years the bush administration has attempted to do everything in its power to minimize and politicize the role of public service in government from hurricane katrina to walter reed to the united states justice department the results have been catastrophic the way this administration has systematically sought to disassemble the federal government and hand over tax payer dollars to its contractor cronies has been shameful we celebrate the movement calling for change that has energized so many americans we plan to stand with senator obama to restore the greatness of america but whoever enters the oval office must restore the credibility of public service
6161178 this will be one of the best benefits that i invest in and it wont be just a financial benefit
6161179 the fact that you could trust them meant a lot
6161180 you know where your money is going to go they are not just doing this for money and that meant a lot if you want to get involved now is the time if you dont want to i encourage you to try getting involved this new administration will make sure these student athletes are taken care of they are going to take the program to new heights
6161181 given that terance frazier is a former student athlete member of the bulldog foundation board of directors and an accomplished entrepreneur we are indeed honored that he has made this investment into the department of athletics his generosity will immediately benefit countless student athletes and his leadership will have a long lasting impact upon bulldog athletics
6161182 i still dont understand how mcgovern could have lost i dont know a single person who voted for nixon
6161183 how is obama going to lose when he will get so much more votes in november than john mcbush
6161184 if anwr is so small and so filled with oil why not slant drill into it do you really think that the only oil in alaska is directly under anwr seriously
6161185 you do know that the oil companies are only drilling on a fraction of the land they currently have leases for why is that maybe because there are no more rigs to send out no more ships to transport and no more capacity at the refineries we have today have you thought of that phil

6161245 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6161246 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership

6161262 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6161263 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6161264 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters

6161342 in contrast to big pharmaceutical concerns it is quite natural for our team to form close relationships with patients and other members of the rare disease community

6161407 people in basrah and nasariyah in the south or mosul in the north always ask us to provide them with products its a good sign for us that people still want high quality
6161408 we faced a hard situation when the insurgents and militias took over the neighborhoods here
6161409 we faced a lot of problems especially with the power
6161410 you know i was the one who showed you your first movies
6161411 all the tears the sweat and sometimes even blood that we shed i now think it was quite worth it when we performed that night all that i could feel in my heart was joy pure joy
6161412 it began as a brainstorming exercise thinking about how students learn what they need to learn for their future and how our current educational system fits in

6161415 we are on a clear road towards nato membership for georgia
6161416 i am looking forward to the speedy withdrawal of russian troops which has not yet happened as we had expected
6161417 to show that we support the georgian people and also the government to deal with the work there is to do
6161418 the security zone is temporary this is not disputed by any of the parties
6161419 it is more important that foreign observers arrive so it is not only troops of the commonwealth of independent states cis
6161420 there is no such notion anymore in georgia as russian peacekeepers there can be no russian peacekeepers these are just russian forces
6161421 a decision was made for the war to start in august the war would have happened regardless of what the georgians did whether they responded to the provocations or not there would have been an invasion of georgia
6161422 the goal was to destroy georgias central government defeat the georgian army and prevent georgia from joining nato
6161423 i think the russians took the wrong lessons from bucharest
6161424 there was a lot of russian pressure and rhetoric against both georgia and ukraine getting membership action plans before bucharest ive heard that russians regard bucharest as a success and what you saw after bucharest was an increase in pressure
6161425 what russia really wants is essentially to be able to do as it pleases in world affairs and to answer to nobody
6161426 it wants a totally free hand particularly in and around the cis it also needs to conjure up the idea of an enemy to justify its regime the fact of the matter is that the most immediate threat here is to georgia because the russian government could pack forces into the north caucasus to threaten georgia
6161427 we heard statements that the russian railroad troops that had entered abkhazia a couple of months ago were there on a humanitarian mission and now we know the truth about why those forces were there it was to rebuild the railroad to allow ammunition and other military supplies to aid a russian invasion
6161428 i am afraid that there is a very strong possibility that military activity will happen this year probably in the next month
6161429 this is a war that russia wanted and clearly had planned for
6161430 the evidence ive seen indicates that the russian army was sitting there waiting for this that this was essentially a provocation launched by the south ossetians who ratcheted up the level of violence in order to bring the georgians who are easily provokable obviously to attack
6161431 and the russians were waiting there ready with an operational plan and with forces in place land sea and air to do what they have subsequently done
6161432 it is difficult to imagine that russia prepared such a provocation while neither of the countrys two leaders was in moscow
6161433 it is also difficult to imagine that russia prepared to go to war and then when saakashvili fell into the trap waited 13 or 14 hours by my count before deploying forces
6161434 russias policies over the past several years caused this war and for this they bear responsibility
6161435 if the ukrainian leadership pushes for nato accession the crimea will demand reunion with russia
6161436 the criminals that are the mouthpieces of the united states cashed in on the conflict in south ossetia
6161437 the ukraine proved itself to be a deceitful player specifically i mean the ukrainian president who backed georgian president saakishvili this will carry a price for the ukrainian people who will face a reshuffle of russias policy toward the ukraine in the form of higher prices for russian gas and oil
6161438 luckily neither yushchenko nor timoshenko nor yanukovich will remain in politics by 2017 a new generation of politicians will come and they will negotiate with russia new terms for the lease prolonging the use of sevastopol by the black sea fleet

6161458 nothing travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of bad news which obeys its own special laws
6161459 i would have invited you all in there if i had wanted you to know what it was
6161460 we were talking about game situations and looking for ways to try to get better
6161461 its just one day and obviously this has been a tough stretch
6161462 i think it was just so new to me last year i didnt know what to expect
6161463 now i know what boston does this team is here to win and produce championships and to be a part of that sometimes nerves might get the better of you
6161464 tough to swallow whenever you go out there and you have a game plan and execute it and it still doesnt work out
6161465 i havent had results but ive been swinging the bat over the past two weeks three weeks
6161466 because i hit a homer doesnt make the difference but i think all that other stuff was just compiling ive returned more to normal since the all star break than i was before that
6161467 i know that stuff happens sometimes but catching routine fly balls should not be that much of a problem
6161468 i really had no idea that he would throw me out
6161469 he made an unbelievable play i saw it on the replay he slid on his knees barehanded it and threw a strike the way were swinging the bats right now i thought being aggressive was the best option
6161470 every night that you lose it makes it more difficult
6161471 its really comforting to know theyre giving me a couple of games to see how it goes
6161472 thats the best part for me because ive already started my routine for the next five days and its nice knowing im going to be here
6161473 we got pitches we could do something with and had some big hits
6161474 were going to have to gut it out we either turn it around or its going to be a long month and a half
6161475 were making less mistakes were starting to believe in what were doing it just validates the work that weve done
6161476 its good but still theres a long ways to go its just nice to be there right now
6161477 you can have the best offense in the league which we do but when a guy is throwing like that youre not going to hit the ball
6161478 i dont think weve played particularly bad in any of these games but tonight was one bad inning
6161479 we just didnt get it done late weve been doing a terrific job of that but not tonight
6161480 im puzzled i stay up late at night thinking about how we can get our offense going
6161481 ill listen to what anybodys got to say fans cab drivers president bush anybody
6161482 i have to keep working in the bullpen to keep the ball down every single time
6161483 thats the bottom line i lost im not going to be satisfied with any loss
6161484 probably opening day and the opening day of deer season are about the only times i get butterflies
6161485 sheets is every bit of what sabathia is this guy started the all star game a matchup like that is what a competitor loves to do
6161486 i havent really been throwing the ball too well lately
6161487 i threw the ball great for two months and have been going through a stretch where im scuffling a little bit but you know thats just part of a long season
6161488 weve been reminded of the streak all the time you just cant think about it
6161489 you have to go out and give your team the best chance to win
6161490 its not from lack of offensive effort its just something some pitchers have to deal with more than others and apparently thats me
6161491 every time we play these guys its never an easy win
6161492 you do a job like that and give up only two runs thats giving your team a good effort
6161493 he gave us a very good chance to win the game
6161494 a clutch performance by todd to shut this club down the way he did
6161495 one thing about our pitching staff for a good while now theyve given us the chance to win games on a continual basis
6161496 its a sign that hes evolving into a quality pitcher he doesnt panic when he gets in trouble hes maturing into the type of pitcher that can get the big outs
6161497 because hes in unchartered waters i want to keep his innings down
6161498 we just have to pick up the slack and do the best we can at this point i dont even know what else the organization can do
6161499 thats the nature of the photograph its a western sense of reality that what is in front of the lens has to be true

6161858 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
6161859 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
6161860 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
6161861 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
6161862 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
6161863 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
6161864 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
6161865 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
6161866 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
6161867 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
6161868 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
6161869 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
6161870 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
6161871 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
6161872 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
6161873 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
6161874 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
6161875 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
6161876 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
6161877 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
6161878 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
6161879 they think oh its a scooter theyre all just the same
6161880 but its not its just like cars every car is going to fit a different person a little bit
6161881 my et4 handled much better for me once i put the lower seat on
6161882 the issue comes between the handlebar and where your front sits
6161883 because when you sit down your knee can get in the way of steering
6161884 it doesnt have that refined italian sports car look its more of a kind of tough off road rugged look
6161885 if you get into some bumpy roads i think you want some weight so you dont go flying off the road
6161886 but if the bike is too heavy for the rider to push then its just plain too heavy
6161887 many shops dont even bother to sell 50cc bikes while a few of our members have 50cc scooters most prefer 150cc or above for navigating the hills
6161888 you need to have the power to get up and go and get out of the way
6161889 for a lot of people it kind of ruins the buying process

6161901 hieraan namen 20 kunstenaars deel maar dit project verdween onder de publiciteitsstroom van de gevangenis waardoor contrapunt het best bewaarde geheim van hoorn werd genoemd maar er gebeurde heel veel en men bleef enthousiast maar tijden veranderen en kennelijk ook de ambities
6161902 ik denk dat de gemeente niet nog eens zon gebouw als oostereiland beschikbaar moet stellen bij gebruik krijgt de gemeente altijd de aansprakelijkheid toegeschoven verder moeten we leren dat we vooraf nog beter moeten communiceren
6161903 you would be amazed by the amount of people that come and look at us
6161904 it doesnt really do a lot for us but you take that with being in a frank lloyd wright building
6161905 we kept it up to some degree but it needed a total paint job and a good cleaning
6161906 a little bit here and there you had to have seen it six months ago to appreciate how bad it was
6161907 i think a testament to wrights work is that this was used as a station with heavy heavy use for 50 years and its still in relatively good shape its really maintained
6161908 itll be really nice to have this party and get back to normal
6161909 we spend a lot of time talking to people and telling them what we can
6161910 i know about the building but im not that informed about frank lloyd wright
6161911 ill try to share what i know if they ask me
6161912 like if the point of the roof is actually true north or if it is an architectural design
6161913 there was an older guy that came in once and asked if frank was working
6161914 frank lloyd wright i said hes actually been in the ground for a couple of years that one was pretty good
6161915 like an old fashioned experience where you get your gas filled your oil checked and your windshield washed
6161916 we want to provide good care but were not trying to create a health care system for people the idea actually is to move people out very quickly and deport them back home
6161917 the intent was to allow every two three or four on our team to play to show exactly where they stand and i was disappointed would be the overall reaction
6161918 of not only knowledge of assignment execution within position mastery and just effort overall
6161919 not only offensively and defensively there were drop offs from our ones special teams then took a drop off even more than that with a few key players so poor in fundamentals and assignments that we couldnt function
6161920 my hope was that i would see guys that we would have to be saying weve got to take him weve got to consider this player to play now and possibly move him up
6161921 it is disappointing especially when those were our backups so if a player goes down and one of those players is in the game we certainly wouldnt want to see it on game day the best thing that happened is we saw it today with a week and a half to go and either it is the wrong player in the wrong spot or it is the right player possibly blocking it that we havent considered yet
6161922 although retailers are continuously evaluating economic conditions as they head into the second half of 2008 they are largely moving ahead with it investment plans

6162056 they sent me a bunch of music and it was a great choice theres a wealth of material on so many fronts
6162057 throughout this album i was inspired by other jazz singers records
6162058 i had certain people in mind like chet baker mel torme sang i like to recognize the tune with a great marty paich arrangement and tony bennett has the only record of this funny world i wanted to avoid too many obvious choices
6162059 we havent done the sinatra stuff out there its great to have all this classy new material

6162069 alls well that ends well enjoys a curious status in the bards canon it is simultaneously one of the most oft quoted titles ever and yet one of the least produced of all of shakespeares plays
6162070 alls well that ends well remains very rarely staged in a shakespeare market that prefers its comedies light and bright
6162071 problem play but that complexity is also what gives this play resonance in our own deeply ambivalent age
6162072 the web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill together
6162073 love her dearly ever ever dearly but its far too early to stamp this ending happy

6162075 laugh now cry later and has just released what he is touting as his political manifesto
6162076 i think that when i released my last record i had more to prove than expecting to step back into the role that i was in you have to have people listening before you can start speaking
6162077 i felt like since 93 political hip hop has been pushed into the background for escapism hip hop now i think the climate is that people are looking for answers or even just where the problem is coming from thats what im trying to spit
6162078 i know the blames definitely to be expected because we are an easy target we are a group of entertainers who go by our own minds we dont go by societys minds and standards
6162079 we talk about the good we talk about the bad we talk about the ugly he says
6162080 thats the part people dont like the ugly so people are always gonna attack us for that we use profanity oh my god thats just taboo in american society i know the blames to be expected but its just silly to attack the mirror when youre the one thats ugly
6162081 a major label isnt gonna do anything for you except put you in a nice video
6162082 raw footage on his own independent label lench mob records and encourages new artists to do the same
6162083 if you got the money you should figure it out for yourself he says
6162084 people buying music direct from the artist its like buying it out of the trunk again the major music chains have done a great job of trying to stomp out this music by coming in buying all the mom and pops and then the major labels closed down so artists are gonna have to have their own form of delivery
6162085 raw footage which thankfully do not bear the stigma of overproduction and ghost writers found in much of modern hip hop whats left is unfiltered cube that to some music industry execs could seem very very threatening
6162086 when all youve got is mtv and bet you cant get our message out there he says
6162087 to be on those networks you gotta go through their censors so now they control the industry but now with the new way of information that is free flowing you can put out your release how you really want it
6162088 if you see one of my new videos they just seem rawer than anything else but theyre not its just that everything else has been censored

6162202 to repair our broken society to heal the wounds of poverty crime social disorder and deprivation that are steadily making this country a grim and joyless place to live for far too many people

6162213 of course a giant side benefit of all this is helping our planet by recycling
6162214 every time a beautiful piece finds its second life in a new home that saves resources energy and space in a landfill our customers are much more aware of this now with the green movement flourishing
6162215 there is no reason to buy new i find the best stuff help the planet save money and get some back by letting hilton house resell items i no longer need in my home things others crave its the best circle of green that exists
6162216 the film was born from my desire to explore the slow silent changes happening in the city i live in
6162217 twelve years ago nobody would have imagined that the city would have changed so much welcoming thousands of immigrants and reshaping itself with the new communities through sergio and youssef and their relationship with their clients the small seed of a new world and how we are adapting to a radical transformation of our social life is born
6162218 we are able to drive business towards need periods effectively by extending value add offers or discounts to this exclusive group without advertising to the general public it saves hotels marketing cost and we avoid publicly discounting rates that may hurt the hotels image
6162219 most hoteliers have embraced internet marketing through third parties such as expedia and opodo but many have yet to realize the power emarketing beholds for each property on its own
6162220 our hotel partners have reported increases of 2 to 3 percentage points in occupancy and 35 to 50 increases in f amp b revenue programme members can also be tapped to fill gaps in occupancy or a last minute catering cancellation turned into a members only paid event the possibilities are really endless
6162221 each hotel has ultimate control over its own programme and its own marketing strategy but yes we believe it can be
6162222 we have statistics to show programme success in terms of positive revenue generation for european and middle east hotels during the gulf war in the early 90s u s hotels immediately post 9 11 and even venezuelan hotels through the years of currency devaluation i would say our programmes have truly been tested through some trying economic and political times in different regions of the world and by very diverse cultures

6162227 were beaming that rkg made the inc 500 though i am still a little surprised
6162228 weve bootstrapped the company placing our emphasis on creating a great place to work and on providing great value to our clients rapid growth wasnt our objective online advertising has boomed and weve grown along with the channel i am tremendously proud of what our team has accomplished
6162229 to me the greatest joy has been in the manner of growth not the amount of growth
6162230 weve grown on revenues not vc funding not loans not acquisitions but rather from providing great service to a growing pool of clients moreover were doing it in a way that generates quality jobs and career options in my home town without grinding our employees into the ground people work hard here but its 40 hours a week not 60 thats important to us
6162231 rona is dedicated to creating value for each market in which we operate we have been in kamloops for a number of years now and were happy to provide customers from the area with a brand new store on the other side of town so they can find everything they need for their renovation or construction projects wherever they are located
6162232 we are proud to be expanding the rona experience in kamloops we have managed to create a unique environment for the community by offering a customer friendly atmosphere with a wide variety of the latest products usually found in large urban centres
6162233 customers who have been visiting us at the mount paul way location will find the same customized service theyve grown accustomed to while benefiting from a larger product selection

6162243 chevron s participation in the hebron project gives our company a strategic platform for growth on the east coast of canada where we are exploring for impact sized resources in the orphan basin and have a major financial interest in the hibernia offshore oil project

6162247 its really difficult for a woman over 40 to conceive
6162248 women feel cultural pressure to get all of their schooling done and much of their career building done before they even start to think about marriage
6162249 my advice is to make getting married and having babies at least as much of a priority as your education goals and career goals

6162257 the earth lay in its infancy in pieces each part being created part by part in the midst of the earth was the lord standing in the midst of the earth that he alone was creating laying through the center of the earth a huge beam this beam formed the foundation of the earth and also at the same time formed a timeline in the earth i saw that the lord laid out this beam and then built the earth around it as the beam lay the lord would stretch himself first one way then the other way over the length of the beam anointing it with his presence and placing it accurately within his perfect will as to what the beam would do and how the beam would be used in time as a factor displaying both his person and his will the earth was founded upon this beam even the will of the lord and everything that was built out from that point was built in his will according to the plan that he had laid out upon it this beam represented to me the fact that his will is being done in the earth even as we speak and that it is according to the plan he laid out even from the foundation of the world as i looked at this beam i noticed that there was upon it a course of flowing blood even the blood of the lord who was as a lamb slain from before the foundation of the world therefore everything that was built upon the beam outward was built with the covenant of blood being the first part and the last part all was washed and contained in the blood of this covenant which blood covered the beam

6162259 it seemed to us that since we had finally brought down soviet communism and seen the birth of democracy in russia the most important thing to do was to help russian democracy take root and integrate russia into europe wasnt that why we fought the cold war to give young russians the same chance at freedom and integration with the west as young czechs georgians and poles wasnt consolidating a democratic russia more important than bringing the czech navy into nato

6162270 i felt like there was a hole in american anthems

6162272 we played house parties for all these trustafarians dancing on the lawn
6162273 wed play like a four or five song set with a few phish covers a few dead covers
6162274 it took me five years to realize that sitting down at a piano and writing songs the way i do now is what im good at
6162275 if you really want something and believe its possible youll probably get it
6162276 in veel gevallen gaat het om oplichters die misbruik maken van mensen met een hart voor dieren
6162277 dergelijke praktijken dienen het welzijn van dieren niet en leiden tot een impulsieve aankoop
6162278 dierenliefhebbers kunnen altijd een huisdier adopteren uit n van de honderd erkende asielen dat ons land rijk is de meeste belgische dierenasielen hanteren een goed plaatsingsbeleid en kunnen dan ook jaarlijks voor een groot aantal dieren een nieuwe eigenaar vinden zo werden er vorig jaar 18 520 honden en 14 657 katten door de belgische asielen geplaatst

6162287 these results suggest that a portion of corn stover could be harvested for biofuel production without reducing soil organic carbon levels in high yielding systems however since this study did not study the direct impact of stover removal that aspect remains to be evaluated
6162288 i believe this notion of understanding user intent being able to analyze search queries and come up with search patterns and use them to shape the search experience is one of the most important areas for us
6162289 early in the game they made a lot of tough shots
6162290 we were doing what we were supposed to be doing and they made tough shots but sooner or later well impose our will i dont know if you can keep up with us for 40 minutes
6162291 i think theyre going to be very very very tough to beat
6162292 theyve been the most difficult team for us to defend
6162293 theyre a force to be reckoned with they caused us a lot of problems
6162294 in the third quarter we said the first three or four minutes we need to pick it up a little bit defensively and make the extra pass offensively

6162300 the worst thing about tonight was the rhodes dibiase defeat at the hands of cena
6162301 edge vs undertaker is the current match of the year and i dont get how anybody can say otherwise
6162302 was it just me or was cenas application of the stfu really sloppy and unbelievable
6162303 im so tired of reading rave reviews for edge who has rapidly become not just the most overrated
6162304 the angle styles match was fine until the overwrought overbooked finish
6162305 jericho being thrown into a match with kane for no reason halts the momentum from the months of great character building
6162306 when has the wwe ever made jericho look good for more than one minute before digging his grave the next
6162307 i wonder if target is going to start selling burlap sacks for their back to school sale ridiculous stuff

6162318 okay girls just marry a hot rich vampire that will attend to your every need and you will miraculously get everything and even have a baby so you dont miss out and a house and this and that and
6162319 i didnt mean dream that you would construe the way i feel about what i did to you to mean that last night wasnt well the best night of my existence
6162320 dont worry sisters if you just have a perfect man who is rich and loves you everything will be okay if not then all is lost
6162321 girls if you lose your man you wont get anyone else mope around and be depressed for all of eternity
6162322 i heard the soft wet sound of the scalpel across her stomach more blood dripping to the floor
6162323 i want to have sex for another year before i turn into a vampire
6162324 just found out she was pregnant and she may have urinated on herself
6162325 there was no weapon found on the neighbor and no independent witnesses that saw the weapon

6162327 for i tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
6162328 elder what do saints have that makes them different from the rest of us and thus they receive the grace of god
6162329 suppose two men are sitting at the table to eat in front of them there is a plate with ten peaches if one of them greedily eats seven peaches leaving three for his friend he is being unfair to him this is injustice
6162330 instead if he says well we are two and the peaches are ten so each one of us is entitled to eat five peaches if he eats the five peaches and leaves five for his friend then he applies human justice that is why many times we go to court to find human justice
6162331 however if he understands that his friend likes peaches very much he can pretend that he is not very fond of them and eat only one and then says to him please eat the rest of the peaches as i dont really like them besides my stomach aches and i should not eat any more this person has divine justice he prefers to be unfair to himself by human standards and be rewarded for his sacrifice by gods grace which he will abundantly receive
6162332 we cant work in the primary line of business application
6162333 if you migrate the server during business hours well be down
6162334 if you migrate the server during business hours our work will be interrupted
6162335 if you were hired as a traffic cop and you didnt issue a ticket for six months would you still have a job
6162336 as close as tom and i are he was going to do his job and make sure i wasnt irresponsible
6162337 it takes people with tenacity and integrity to protect our environment its easy to just turn around and do nothing
6162338 to stay on course with our decision to provide only the facts on this very sensitive personnel matter
6162339 i dont think it would be productive for our team
6162340 there are responsibilities to being an nfl player its a privilege not a right there is a lot that comes with being an nfl player
6162341 at the end of the day the owner has the final say of whether he wants to give the guy an opportunity
6162342 we are handicapped because we have lost too many key people
6162343 its kind of a do or die situation if not now its definitely going to be never
6162344 because theyre idiots theres a very particular kind of psychology to someone who chooses when other people are making melodies to bang away with great ferocity behind them youre a big monkey kid with add which drummers kind of have to be
6162345 its funnier to have me not work out to be as pale and flabby as i naturally am for the audiences enjoyment i think people have really responded to the movie because when you see nudity in hollywood films its usually really hot bodies even jason segal in forgetting sarah marshall hes got a nice bod he works out and hes got a big dick so theyre not used to seeing a pale flabby normal guy naked and its really sent america into a tizzy
6162346 im always in reaction to other actors and bouncing off other actors but fish drives this story so for the first couple of days it was me doing my first couple of takes like im used to doing and the director coming in and going no no youve got to move this along and drive this forward and really try to get what you want so i really had to shift gears
6162347 i think its an important part of acting to just be to find those moments when you can just feel and breathe and live as the character that can really allow the audience into the character they can project their thoughts into the world of the character
6162348 whats amazing to me is that dwight is such an oddball from how he comports himself to the fact that hes got a beet farm but people identify with him so much they know people in offices who are like him i used to say that people love to hate dwight but its not really true people just love to love dwight
6162349 this is kind of the age of the geek in american culture theres a big crossover that happened when all of a sudden geeks were running the media youve got geek rock stars like beck and weezer microsoft and all of a sudden theyre seen in a different way it really is revenge of the nerds on a national scale and dwight is the poster boy for that
6162350 i think i was the first person to blog in character on the tv show i thought it would be something that would be fun to do and reveal a different side of dwight that was early on in the show and we were doing anything we could to help promote the show the internet was a very valuable tool it was really the success of the show on itunes and the fans spreading the word about it out on the web that took it from a tiny cult show to a popular mainstream hit
6162351 theres literally videos of me on youtube eating my lunch just the other day someone was filming me at baggage claim just waiting for our suitcases to come out what am i supposed to do if i go over and say could you not do that theyll probably film that and thatll end up on the web and ill be a dick so i just try to ignore it
6162352 the big change there was having carl and bo in the band
6162353 that and recording outside our comfort zone which was the farm that we always recorded on it was the first time we worked with a producer and actually let somebody into our world
6162354 its just one of those things about having new guys in the band and for the other three of us to have it be something different in a sense gives it a new life
6162355 the process wasnt probably too different just having some fresh ears and some different background perspectives with those two guys
6162356 i think our bodies had been telling us for a long time you need to chill out you need to take some time
6162357 last spring we got the demos for this record and the first thing i noticed is that they were more upbeat than the last record
6162358 you could definitely hear that and its all speculation but im sure part of it was him having a relationship he was happy with at the time and just being in a different head space
6162359 you could hear it all over the record it sounds like different characters which i think is kind of a testament to him being comfortable with his voice
6162360 it really felt like on this one he could use the reverb as more of a tool instead of something that was kind of covering up the nakedness of his voice
6162361 the first three songs and the last two or three songs are the most out there of anything weve ever done
6162362 if you took just those five to six songs its a ween record a different genre every time but a genre that i dont even know exists
6162363 whoever the next president is health care should be at the top of his agenda bringing everyone to the table and make it happen
6162364 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
6162365 our goal is to get the greatest recovery possible on loans in default or in danger of default while helping troubled borrowers remain in their homes
6162366 i definitely thought we could bring something of value to the project
6162367 but then again part of me also felt that this was just one of those random inquiries you get in the business
6162368 it was amazing how nervous everybody became when he arrived
6162369 over there hes like brad pitt and tom cruise rolled into one
6162370 there is a big difference between being a tourist and trying to accomplish something on a timetable
6162371 fortunately the people i met in the indian film industry were incredibly supportive
6162372 bollywood calls in rambo for strike on u s cinema

6162386 gemma is a fiercely loyal mother not only to her son also to her sort of family of club members theyre kind of this counterculture group and shes the matriarch of that group
6162387 whatever her history is it has left her being somebody that is a fighter what we can expect is that if shes at all threatened by any kind of potential for a breakup of her family or harm to her son she will go to any length to protect that and you will see that in various forms
6162388 i think she has no conflicted feelings about it shes all about the club shes all about her family she loves her life and the lifestyle that this has provided for her she sees nothing wrong with what she does
6162389 from gemmas perspective she sees nothing wrong with what she does and its all a means to an end with her in the pilot you see some pretty harsh things when her son and grandson are threatened and from her perspective its what needs to be done
6162390 i dont know if theres any plans for it it wasnt really planned out it just sort of happened
6162391 not that i know of and i would really like there to be we shot the four dvd movies and theyve released two of them already theres another one coming out in november were done with recording so i dont know somebody has to buy some more the blog fans and the web fans have been the most instrumental in getting that to happen
6162392 its such a smart show so that would be a great move for somebody
6162393 katey sagal talks about sons of anarchy singing and the future of futurama
6162394 i have been aspiring to the world record for so long
6162395 i am glad to know he is from jamaica and that he is supernatural
6162396 it was a much more amazing start than he got in the 100 meters and then his turn was just absolutely fabulous
6162397 so you see whichever virtue you apply you are led to the same result that is to the elimination and purification of your own will man will spiritually progress and be benefited only when he manages to eliminate his will to zero when the americans want to send a missile to space they do the same thing they count from ten to zero when they reach zero then the missile is fired the same applies to our soul when our wills are eliminated to zero and our soul is cleansed then it is elevated towards god
6162398 the grace of god entered our soul through the holy baptism it is a gift granted to all of us sometimes we think that god gave to a saint more gifts than others this is wrong christ loves all of his children the same it is we however who do not value and appreciate gods gift to the same degree when someone is grateful and believes that the grace of christ which he received through holy baptism is inside his soul he humbles his own will and purifies himself in order to allow divine grace to function when divine grace functions inside a soul it makes us think that god favored this person with more gifts however the truth is that this person loves christ more and through his humility permits god to act on his behalf
6162399 without a doubt luck is involved i dont think anyone would tell you otherwise the choice one needs to make though is this either you believe that luck is dominant in which case why bother with effort or you believe that luck is random in which case it can be eliminated from your thinking and you can focus on all the stuff you can control i dont think luck alone gets you into harvard law school or a clerkship at the supreme court i dont think luck gets someone to buy your car the best in its class and a great value instead of the lame alternative ive been astonishingly lucky with many elements of my career mostly because solid singles turned into doubles or the occasional homer i figure most of the failures are my fault and many of the successes were really good breaks but i cant imagine how lonely and depressing it would be to view myself as nothing but a pinball batted around by forces over which i have no influence
6162400 i dont need a million people to see my things just the right people who have hopefully good taste to buy my things
6162401 i want to position your breast so i can get a great image if i can get two great images you will be out of here in no time

6162403 these look great nice clean images you are so lucky your breasts arent dense
6162404 ill give these to dr hakim and hopefully i get you out of here in no time its gorgeous out i want you to enjoy the day but dr hakim will make the final call and i may have to take more
6162405 the images show no changes since you last mammogram which is good
6162406 so dr hakim feels comfortable with the results and just wants you to come back in 6 months this will put you back on your annual bi lateral exam cycle
6162407 when you called me into the hall i thought something was wrong

6162436 there is a little bit of slowing occurring in the canadian economy and that squares with what weve seen with a lot of the other economic data out recently
6162437 this tragic accident is but the latest example of the destruction that can result from a lack of effective pressure relief systems and practices

6162446 prime minister vladimir putin has temporarily chosen to seek his objectives through military pressure and western acquiescence rather than by naked occupation his objectives are clear they go beyond detaching south ossetia and abkhazia from georgia and absorbing them into russia they go beyond destroying the georgian army leaving the country at russias mercy the real objective is the finlandization of georgia through the removal of president mikheil saakashvili and his replacement by a russian puppet what is to be done lets be real theres nothing to be done militarily what we can do is alter putins cost benefit calculations we are not without resources 1 s uspend the nato russia council established in 2002 to help bring russia closer to the west make clear that dissolution will follow suspension the council gives russia a seat at the nato table message invading neighboring democracies forfeits the seat 2 bar russian entry to the world trade organization 3 dissolve the g 8 putins dictatorship long made russias presence in this group of industrial democracies a farce but no one wanted to upset the bear by expelling it no need to the seven democracies simply withdraw and if italys silvio berlusconi who has been sympathetic to putins georgia adventure wants to stay he can have an annual g 2 dinner with putin 4 announce a u s european boycott of the 2014 winter olympics at sochi to do otherwise would be obscene

6162524 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
6162525 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
6162526 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
6162527 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6162528 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6162529 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6162530 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6162531 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6162532 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6162533 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6162534 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6162535 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6162536 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6162537 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6162538 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6162539 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6162540 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6162541 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6162542 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6162543 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6162544 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6162545 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

6162547 creating a sound corporate image while maintaining focus on the product is essential for don wands
6162548 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6162549 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6162550 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6162551 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6162552 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6162553 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6162554 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6162555 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6162556 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6162557 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6162558 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6162559 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6162560 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6162561 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6162562 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6162563 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6162564 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6162565 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6162566 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6162567 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6162568 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6162569 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6162570 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6162571 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6162572 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6162573 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

6162575 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6162576 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6162577 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6162578 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6162579 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6162580 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6162581 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6162582 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6162583 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6162584 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6162585 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6162586 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6162587 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6162588 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6162589 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6162590 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

6162609 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche

6162685 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6162686 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6162687 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6162688 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6162689 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6162690 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6162691 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6162692 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6162693 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6162694 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6162695 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6162696 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6162697 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6162698 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6162699 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6162700 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6162701 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6162702 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

6162704 there were no significant studies examining the long term health of people in communities with naturally fluoridated water however exposure via drinking water at levels not much higher than what was proposed for fluoridation had been associated in numerous published studies beginning around 1940 with serious adverse skeletal and neuromuscular effects in india and other countries opposition to fluoridation initially came from scientists concerned about the lack of good evidence on possible health risks
6162705 those who did openly oppose fluoridation were often subject of personal attack and professional reprisals for decades mainstream scientific journals would reject for publication any paper that did not articulate a strictly pro fluoridation position on risk and benefit questions
6162706 i myself had three manuscripts based on my doctoral dissertation rejected by u s public health journals in the 1970s
6162707 my reviews of the evidence on risks and benefits of fluoridation were sent to anonymous pro fluoridation referees who found them
6162708 leading phs dental researchers lobbied every leading scientific organization to gain endorsements of fluoridation they cast fluoridation as a product of scientific progress under siege from anti scientific forces and rallied the scientific community in political support of the measure they carried out a few studies looking for possible adverse effects of fluoridation the studies were poorly designed and inconclusive by todays standards but they found no convincing evidence of harm the phs declared the issues closed the debate over the studies were roundly criticized as inadequate and biased by leading opponents of the day but fluoridation advocates rapidly took the stance that there was no longer any scientific doubt that fluoridation was safe and effective their political strategy was simply to steamroll the opposition to insist that opponents had no basis for any valid objections they focused on political campaigning not on research in fact research all but halted as it was politically inexpedient for the phs to be studying questions they had already declared adequately answered

6162729 continue to provide needed humanitarian aid to the georgian people
6162730 it is not significant and it needs to increase both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increase and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6162731 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6162732 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6162733 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6162734 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6162735 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6162736 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6162737 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6162738 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6162739 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6162740 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6162741 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6162742 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people

6162849 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6162850 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6162851 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6162852 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6162853 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6162854 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6162855 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6162856 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6162857 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6162858 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6162859 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6162860 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6162861 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6162862 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6162863 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6162864 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6162865 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6162866 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6162867 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6162868 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6162869 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6162870 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6162871 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6162872 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6162873 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6162874 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6162875 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6162876 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6162877 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6162878 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6162879 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6162880 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6162881 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6162882 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6162883 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6162884 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6162885 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6162886 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6162887 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6162888 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6162889 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6162890 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6162891 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6162892 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6162893 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6162894 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6162895 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6162896 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6162897 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6162898 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6162899 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6162900 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6162901 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6162902 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6162903 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6162904 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6162905 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6162906 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6162907 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6162908 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6162909 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6162910 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6162911 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6162912 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6162913 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6162914 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6162915 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6162916 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6162917 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6162918 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6162919 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6162920 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6162921 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6162922 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6162923 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6162924 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6162925 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6162926 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6162927 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6162928 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6162929 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6162930 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6162931 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6162932 this is a planning took where all things are going
6162933 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6162934 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6162935 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6162936 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6162937 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6162938 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6162939 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6162940 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6162941 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6162942 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6162943 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6162944 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6162945 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6162946 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6162947 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6162948 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6162949 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6162950 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6162951 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6162952 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6162953 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6162954 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6162955 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6162956 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6162957 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6162958 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6162959 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6162960 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6162961 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6162962 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6162963 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6162964 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6162965 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6162966 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6162967 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6162968 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6162969 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6162970 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6162971 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6162972 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6162973 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6162974 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6162975 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6162976 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6162977 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6162978 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6162979 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6162980 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6162981 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6162982 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6162983 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6162984 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6162985 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6162986 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6162987 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6162988 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6162989 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6162990 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6162991 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6162992 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6162993 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6162994 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6162995 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6162996 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6162997 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6162998 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6162999 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6163000 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6163001 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6163002 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6163003 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6163004 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6163005 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6163006 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6163007 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6163008 you plug it right into to a 110 volt receptacle like a lamp

6163024 this is one of my favorite charts a comparison of the distance a car can drive based on either of the following forms of energy each produced on 100m x 100m of land 2 5 acres how come that biofuel does not really cut it electric cars are about four times more energy efficient than fuel based cars no matter whether they are based on biofuel or other fuel this is because any fuel engine mostly creates heat and thus wastes the majority of the available energy units combine this with plants not being very efficient solar energy harvesters relative to semiconductor based solar electricity and the result is this huge difference
6163025 i for one have vowed that the prius i bought six years ago will have been the last fuel powered car i d buy in my life presently it is baking in the sun all day while i m at work my future all electric car would charge up while idling under a solar carport

6163064 here in his own words based on almost total recall is commander mccains narrative of 5 years in the hands of the north vietnamese
6163065 skewers once and for all the cherished right wing falsehood that this happened to solzhenitsyn at all
6163066 of course its still possible that mccain or salter picked this up from the sort of right wing circles that it first originated in after all this tale was bandied about by chuck colson and many other wingnuts for years mccain or salter could have picked it up from such circles
6163067 the story about alexander solzhenitsen and the old man who made the sign of the cross was first told by solzhenitsyn to a group of christian leaders and later recounted by billy graham in his new years telecast 1977 it has been retold subsequently most publicly by senator jesse helms r nc
6163068 mccains recounting of this story has changed over the years and
6163069 one more thing mccains various stories only talk of one guard the only real human being that i ever met over there and yet the guard who loosened his ropes in may 1969 could not have been present the following christmas as mccain had been transferred to another location unless the transfer occurred between christmas and new year of 1969 and unless the guard was transferred to exactly the same camp at the same time
6163070 this only solves a piece of the mystery but its a key piece it doesnt necessarily rule out the possibility that mccain or his biographer mark salter picked up the tale that this happened to solzhenitsyn elsewhere and embellished it for their own purposes

6163093 all the boys are talking about it and weve all been on the phone to each other wondering what is going to happen
6163094 i think well be alright this year but we are all a bit worried about the following two years
6163095 its not good for any sport to be losing sponsors and we are just hoping that there will be some good news soon and hopefully we will get a big sponsor to take over the world championship and maybe a few other tournaments as well
6163096 id also like to see more events including some maybe in may or june as it gives you more to practice for and the new tournament in bahrain in november is a step in the right direction
6163097 news about losing sponsors is not good and i was not pleased to read about that but hopefully everyone can get their act together and manage to get somebody else in
6163098 all the players are quite friendly so i hope there is never a split in the sport as it would be sad to lose the other half that i was not playing with
6163099 i dont think it would be good for the sport and i just hope some money comes in sponsorship wise and we dont go down that line
6163100 it is hard to believe that there could be a repeat of last years final at such an early stage and neither of us will want to go home at the start of the week
6163101 it wasnt a surprise to be playing fergal in the final last year as he had been playing well again after a couple of lean years but it just took him a while to come through the rankings again
6163102 i watched some of his matches and the fact that he beat john higgins and ronnie osullivan showed that he was in very good form
6163103 i knew i would have to play as well as i had done in the previous rounds to win and that was how it turned out
6163104 to be honest i havent looked any further ahead than michael or fergal in the second round and i dont really sit down and analyse the draw for the big tournaments
6163105 whoever i play i know i have to play well on the day to win and i dont mind just showing up on the day and playing whoever is put in front of me
6163106 there are only seven ranking tournaments on the calendar so winning two of them and reaching the final of another represents a good season
6163107 i knew my form was alright but i maybe burned myself out a bit ahead of the world championships when you should be looking to be fresh as the matches are a bit longer and everyone is trying that little bit harder
6163108 thats taking nothing away from joe perry who played great snooker at sheffield and just pipped me by a single frame
6163109 the fact that fergal came through to reach the final in belfast and ali carter was a world finalist shows the strength in depth in the sport now
6163110 there are more players coming through every year and doing well in the top tournaments
6163111 nobody fears the top players any more and there are loads of good players out there so the rankings dont mean a lot
6163112 ronnie is that bit ahead of everyone else and we are all playing catch up but really anyone can beat anyone else on the day
6163113 when ronnie is on his game he is sometimes unstoppable and even when his head is maybe not 100 per cent right he can still play great snooker and beat you
6163114 he is definitely the world number one but you just have to concentrate and do your best if you come up against him
6163115 took a total break from the game before easing back into it
6163116 im looking forward to the first tournament in belfast but i imagine there will be a bit of rustiness among all the players not just me hopefully
6163117 i think well all get a bit nervous as we havent felt the pressure for a while having been out of action for two months
6163118 if i dont practice right then i wouldnt even contemplate winning a tournament
6163119 i have to put in four and a half or five hours a day and have been doing that for the last three weeks so hopefully that will be enough to allow me to play well as i did last season
6163120 i guess all the players like spending time with their families rather than being down at the snooker hall but you have to have some discipline
6163121 a great venue where all the boys try to put on a good show
6163122 the fans all love their snooker in northern ireland and it is good to play in an arena with a good atmosphere especially when some of the irish lads are playing as the crowd really gets behind them
6163123 ive played ronnie at wembley and enjoyed that so if i come up against some of the northern ireland lads i will just look forward to it
6163124 only a handful of players that really tie the game up and try to put other players off
6163125 those players know who they are and nobody enjoys playing against them but 95 per cent of the players just go out and play their own game
6163126 i played with a bow tie for my first few years as a professional but developed a neck condition and that really put me off
6163127 i went to the doctor and he managed to get a letter to allow me to play without it

6163491 when i have a problem the easiest people for me to go to are the captains because they are the guys who were overwhelmingly supported by the entire team and that they perceive to be the voice of the team

6163671 i went to downing st because me and my classmates are fed up with the state of our school building its a thatched longhouse and its over 350 years old and although it might look pretty our school is a real pain its so small that we have to have music lessons in the kitchen eat our school dinners in one of the classrooms and make do with just a tiny playground to run around in the council says it doesnt have enough money to rebuild the school so were taking matters into our own hands the school has already written to tony blair telling him about the cramped and uncomfortable conditions we have to learn in in the reply it said we should be able to move to a new building before the prime minister leaves his job that was nine years ago and were still waiting action because of our schools history no alterations are allowed to be made at the moment we have to walk down a busy narrow road to get from the main school to the school house we dont think thats very practical or safe so now we want some action our petition has 400 signatures from pupils parents teachers and people who live in the village we hope this will show the prime minister we mean business and need his help fingers crossed
6163672 i live in east devon i like living here because i can go sailing snorkelling and wildlife watching when i first heard about the napoli i was worried about the pollution and the damage it could do to the environment because i love the beaches around here i read stories about rubbish and dead wildlife washed up on the beach water testing i wondered how long it would take for the environment to get better so newsround helped me to find out more i had the most amazing day because first i went to sidmouth beach and interviewed a man from the environment agency we took some water samples to see how clean the sea was the samples were then going to be sent to a laboratory to be tested but i was told that the water did look clean which i was pleased about oily birds after lunch i went with newsround to lynton in north devon to help the rspca let 28 guillemots free at the valley of rocks these seabirds got covered in oil from the napoli and had to be rescued and have the oil washed off them now after weeks of recovery they were going to be released back in the wild wriggling when i arrived there i helped carry the boxes to where they were going let the birds go we took them to a very high cliff which was freezing and was extremely windy i was really excited and i knew the birds wanted to be free new home sean of the rspca said that 995 seabirds were rescued and 380 had to be put to sleep sean was hoping to release at least 350 seabirds back to the wild he said it was not safe to return them in east devon because its too close to the napoli and they could get oiled again the rspca think the birds will be able to make a new home in woody bay one wish at the end of my day i found out that a lot is being done to help the environment to clean the water up and help the birds get back into the wild i only wish the birds could have returned to their home in east devon and i hope the napoli will be gone soon
6163673 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6163674 we are aware of the media reports and therefore we have to look into it
6163675 i came to tell you that the work that you are doing here is essential
6163676 the best way to be loyal to your comrades is to continue your work is to raise your head to be professional
6163677 its tragic and im very sad what happened to those young boys
6163678 must explain to french people why their soldiers are dying 6 000 kilometres from their territory
6163679 to improve the bilateral relations with the u s including redefining the french role in nato sarkozy or to prove how reliable its german ally is
6163680 as a matter of fact there was a fire up in the attic how did you know that
6163681 yes you are looking at the very same view i once looked at
6163682 were trying not to provoke them otherwise theyll stay here for five to six months
6163683 both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increase and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6163684 were not going to let this aggression stand the world is behind you
6163685 we cant let a bully do this because if they do it here theyll do it other places and if we dont stop it here well have to stop it in a much more difficult way
6163686 not going to prevent the american people from helping you
6163687 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6163688 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6163689 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6163690 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6163691 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6163692 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6163693 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6163694 but it is more important to have friends who share your values and your aspirations and your dreams and poland and the united states are those kind of friends
6163695 if it had to be done again i would do it
6163696 the work you are doing here is vital i say that to your comrades in europe because there are soldiers from the whole of europe here
6163697 the best way of remaining faithful to your comrades is to continue the work to lift your heads to be professional
6163698 a part of the worlds freedom is at stake here this is where the fight against terrorism is being waged
6163699 were going to make sure that the means are put in place to ensure that this doesnt happen again
6163700 we should not make precipitous choices because of this drama we must redefine the mission and set precise goals
6163701 if the aims are just are the tactics being used to achieve them correct
6163702 unless we do that pay more attention we will continue to suffer
6163703 sepakbola brasil juara dunia lima kali menginformasikan kematian tim dunga kemarin di beijing china
6163704 kami sudah dekat di akhir kesepakatan dan saya berharap hal kecil sudah dapat dipenuhi secepat mungkin saya sangat senang jika sheva kembali ke milan bagi kami dia akan merasa kembali pulang ke rumah
6163705 the phones are not working i dont know what to do
6163706 nicolas is a rider with a big future with important physical abilities
6163707 he already has some solid experience and is arriving at maturity as a rider all of that should enable to realize his potential in the big races
6163708 it means that the third ddg 1000 ship is very likely to go forward and yet theres also the potential of building more ddg 51s
6163709 this plan will provide stability of the industrial base and continue the development of advanced surface ship technologies such as radar systems stealth magnetic and acoustic quieting and automated damage control
6163710 the slowdown in originations has come from both a decrease in the supply of capital available and a decrease in the demand for new mortgages
6163711 it is likely volumes will remain muted until buyers sellers borrowers lenders and their expectations of rates and terms match closely enough for transaction activity to pick back up
6163712 valerie bertinelli became a popular fixture on television playing one of two children being raised by a single working mother on one day at a time turner programming czar michael wright says
6163713 now shes exploring that world from the opposite angle playing a single working mother raising two children between valeries comic skills and dave caplans highly relatable humor were very excited to watch this pilot take shape
6163714 at this point in the game microsoft should really come clean with a statement that rescinds its linux patent suing threat altogether
6163715 microsoft corp and novell inc are announcing an incremental investment in their relationship to meet accelerating customer demand for their business model solution which is designed to build a bridge between open source and proprietary software to deliver interoperability and intellectual property ip peace of mind for organizations operating mixed source it environments
6163716 buy from us instead of red hat or microsoft will sue you
6163717 reduced cdo cushions are becoming more commonplace with the dual pressures of reduced liquidity and increased delinquencies
6163718 constrained liquidity may also lead to more managers modifying and extending loans rather than repurchasing them which if not merited may only serve to delay the possible realization of losses on these loans
6163719 police say pot smokers who light up during the democratic national convention can expected to get busted under state laws even though a voter approved city ordinance makes small amounts of marijuana the lowest law enforcement priority
6163720 were concerned during the democratic national convention that they are going to use the law to cite people or detain them
6163721 after i finished running the 100 metre i was saying this is possible
6163722 if im going to break it anywhere its going to be here because the track is quick
6163723 i just came out here and just gave it my all so im happy
6163724 come on when youre running if you see youre going to win youre going to celebrate
6163725 youre going to be olympic champion youre just happy thats pretty much it
6163726 were not worried about time here when you get on the circuit then you worry about breaking world records
6163727 hes bolts doing it and making it look so simple michael johnson did it and it didnt looked that easy
6163728 ai que vergonha aqui estou eu fazendo isto de novo continuo fazendo isto continuo fazendo esta bobagem
6163729 ah meu sistema de orienta o est funcionando consigo perceber que a minha energia est fluindo na dire o oposta daquilo que eu quero
6163730 voc diz que quer isto mas est vibrando aquilo quer tomar uma nova decis o hoje de manh mesmo voc falou que queria isto na sua afirma o n s ouvimos voc dizer que queria isto mas agora voc est pensando vibrando e sentindo deste outro jeito quer tomar uma nova decis o
6163731 sim acho que isto que eu farei posso sentir que a minha energia est fluindo no sentido oposto daquilo que eu quero o que que estou querendo
6163732 we dont use guns cars interfaces puzzles or enemies we replace them with emotional involvement and contextual actions and decision making
6163733 we believe that videogames are no longer reserved for kids and teenagers but that the interactive media is now mature enough to tell more complex stories for an adult audience
6163734 we believe in a game where the player will actually play the story instead of watching it where he can be the actor but also the writer and director at the same time
6163735 although it is rendered in full 3d and fully interactive we think about it not like a videogame anymore but as a different kind of experience based upon emotions
6163736 special assistant to the provost for faculty recruitment and retention
6163737 ill hear from a dean or a department chair trying to hire a target candidate saying the only way that person will take the job is if their husband or wife can get a job
6163738 sometimes i get a flat out no and sometimes i can find a way in for the other person
6163739 but i cant tell anyone who to hire my success rate is hard to measure and it isnt as high as id like
6163740 they cant rely on their status alone if they dont pay attention to this issue faculty today are voting with their feet
6163741 recruiters need to understand how personal and professional lives are linked in new ways given the diversity of the new generation of academics
6163742 you cant take practices that were developed to fit an earlier demographic and expect them to work for newcomers
6163743 when stanford asked what my issues were in coming back the top concern was getting a job for christine
6163744 shed have to give up a tenure track position in minnesota if we came back
6163745 i had a sick feeling writing my termination letter at minnesota
6163746 it wouldve been my dream job but in thinking of us as a family this made the most sense stanford has so many benefits that im happy being here
6163747 i ask people to be receptive when it comes to partner hiring
6163748 its a virtue to think of how hiring the couple is good for the overall university not just individual departments
6163749 at most you can say theres an earlier or more generous look at someones file
6163750 but theres almost nothing that a department would gain by picking a less qualified person and the difficulty we have in getting a couple hired ensures there is no pernicious effect
6163751 probably as left as you could get without being a communist
6163752 thats the kind of guy id like to be president

6163757 our goal is to get the greatest recovery possible on loans in default or in danger of default while helping troubled borrowers remain in their homes
6163758 we are undertaking this routine maintenance during our slower seasons so as to reduce the impact on park visitors
6163759 we will continue to focus our efforts on enhancing the visitor experience by rehabilitating and upgrading degraded sites areas and infrastructure in the campground this normal upkeep and maintenance is instrumental in providing the public with an enjoyable camping experience at pinnacles the overall character of the campground will not change
6163760 were really excited about these new opportunities to help our rural areas
6163761 the projects will create jobs and make the areas better places to live
6163762 we know that mercury can have toxic effects on the nervous system but it has not yet been determined that dental amalgams have adverse health effects because of their mercury content
6163763 but we are examining the evidence and performing a risk based evaluation to see if more special controls on safety and effectiveness are justified
6163764 weve looked at silver amalgams harder than any other filling material and theres just no evidence that it harms any of the sensitive groups
6163765 wenn wir wirtschaftliche interessen beiseite lassen dann bleibt dass ich mich gesellschaftlich aktiv einbrachte und pers nlich oppositionsparteien finanziell unterst tzte
6163766 dieser vortrag war das resultat von diskussionen mit vielen leuten auch der kreml verwaltung einige von ihnen mussten den kreml danach verlassen das sind die fakten

6163769 as the virtualization market continues to grow it is critical that our partners can explain the business rationale behind their technology decisions avnets services help partners do just that by mapping virtualization solutions to company objectives and creating a formal business case around the investment
6163770 were encouraging school districts that when they build new school to keep in mind two things one is energy conservation because energy is finite and theres a limited amount and also it saves money i would rather spend money in the classroom on classroom supplies and materials than paying for the power than paying for the heating and things like that
6163771 this donation will help purchase materials to repair and reconstruct the homes of people who dont qualify for fema
6163772 this year we wanted to give something in addition to help with the hurricane recovery
6163773 weve helped buckner over the years because they target the needy and the funds go where they are most needed
6163774 i want to thank our employees and contractors for understanding the importance of a community effort following a storm like dolly
6163775 we place great value being a responsible corporate citizen and were a proud operator and neighbor in the valley
6163776 you have some people who have gotten sick there is a lot of debris and septic tank overflow there are also a lot of people getting denials from fema
6163777 while stocks in the equipment and services group tend to move with oil prices in the near term their profits depend more on exploration spending than on commodity prices
6163778 concerns about slowing demand for crude oil and re ned products both in the u s and overseas have many investors worried but investors in the equipment and services group should not panic
6163779 most producers continue to spend aggressively and u s crude oil inventories remain well below the average for this time of year with fewer than 20 days of supply in storage
6163780 demand for offshore drilling services remains strong giving transocean excellent growth potential consensus estimates project per share profits will rise 69 in 2008 and 15 in 2009 transocean the worlds largest offshore drilling contractor operates in every major drilling region
6163781 a combination of tight global rig supplies and the ongoing discovery of new offshore reserves have driven rig lease rates higher and kept transoceans fleet busy the companys largest most expensive rigs are 95 sold out for 2009 and the backlog is growing
6163782 oceaneering international has fallen 28 since the end of june reflecting a drop in petroleum prices and somewhat disappointing guidance for the second half of 2008 the pullback represents a buying opportunity as the stock seems cheap considering oceaneerings pro t outlook
6163783 oceaneering makes its money by selling equipment and providing services to drillers a business that should remain lucrative as long as drilling demand remains strong exploration activity is likely to remain robust even if per barrel oil prices fall to the 80 to 100 range
6163784 given the large number of offshore wells now being drilled 300 plus in 2008 with even more to come demand for oceaneerings products should pick up
6163785 in addition todays deeper wells will require longer umbilicals the tubes used to pump oil robust demand for remotely operated vehicles is driving rental rates up oceaneerings 214 vessels represent the worlds largest feelt of remote vehicles
6163786 company guidance looks conservative and we expect oceaneering to exceed wall street expectations over the next year in the wake of the recent sell off the shares trade at a modest 14 times estimated year ahead earnings
6163787 since oceaneerings profits and cash flows are not directly affected by changes in oil prices we expect the shares to recover rising substantially over the next year on the strength of robust operating results
6163788 its very difficult to be a career person and have a relationship
6163789 i didnt succeed at doing it at all its incredibly hard
6163790 i think you have to figure out some way of keeping all of those capabilities and requirements in your life in balance
6163791 i empowered myself by not staying in the thing with russell
6163792 i felt it was going to be repeating some similar patterns that id just gotten out of and it was a drag because i was crazy about him
6163793 the market has changed quite a bit since then inflation and interest rates are climbing and shares of indian builders home price appreciation and demand for land are slowing of course this might be a good time to jump in and pick up land at distressed sale prices but he will be competing against established players
6163794 jesus christ no she doesnt deserve a f king song that one
6163795 the issue is not the act itself it is the profile of fans that follow the act wiltshire police do not have an issue with pete doherty or babyshambles
6163796 we might even do it at petes house in a big barn were definitely going to honour those tickets somehow but as far as the festival goes our hands are tied babyshambles have played about 25 festivals this year theyve been playing festivals all summer whats the difference with this one
6163797 the guolizhuang menu is a broad introduction to the medicinal benefits of eating animal penises and testicles
6163798 my ultimate idea of success that i havent achieved yet would be for the artistic projects to sustain me financially
6163799 but if i can spend my creative energies on projects that make me happy being part of the mechanism that moves culture forward thats success
6163800 you have an enormous amount of material and you have to distill it to a syrup by the end of the day so much of it is a hewing process chipping away at things that arent the point or aren t the story or arent the intention really its that last couple of drops you re distilling that makes all the difference it isn t that hard to get a ton of corn into a gallon of sour mash but to get that gallon of sour mash down to that one shot of pure whiskey takes patience
6163801 winston for gods sake snap out of it look at this as a blessing in disguise

6163820 i think its disgraceful and i will fight it every inch of the way
6163821 i am still really reeling at the size of the impact on my constituency
6163822 for many local people they will not be able to travel long distances to use other post offices especially in areas where there are poor public transport links
6163823 theres potential to renegotiate some of the outreach programmes which will affect eight current post offices although the five closures will be difficult to reverse
6163824 yes sure im watching at night when i have the time

6163838 combined with the improvements were rolling out to deliver a more consistent shopping experience this fall buyers will see more bargains than ever and keep coming back to ebay to buy from you
6163839 as for auction style listings weve decided not to make any changes we believe this format is already a good deal especially when you list with a low start price auctions will always have a place on ebay they are a proven way for sellers to get the best value for their unique items and they continue to receive significant exposure in search as they are sorted primarily based on time ending soonest
6163840 today only a small fraction of sellers fall below this threshold yet they are responsible for a high percentage of customer complaints which hurts you and our marketplace overall were urging all sellers whose scores fall below the 4 3 threshold to use the next two months to adjust their business models and or work on improving their dsr scores
6163841 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
6163842 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
6163843 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
6163844 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
6163845 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
6163846 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
6163847 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
6163848 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
6163849 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
6163850 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
6163851 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
6163852 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
6163853 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
6163854 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
6163855 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
6163856 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
6163857 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
6163858 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
6163859 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
6163860 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
6163861 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
6163862 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
6163863 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
6163864 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
6163865 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
6163866 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
6163867 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice

6164060 i remember lloy saying not to think beyond the present thats being human and you just have to release those thoughts and just move on to the next point
6164061 i was just glad that i weathered the storm emotionally
6164062 it was awesome for ball to have the confidence to set me there it was a huge point maybe the biggest point of our careers so when he came to me i knew i was going to put the ball down
6164063 a real important thing for us is to maybe play with a little more heart than they do play a little bit more tactically than they do and just fight
6164064 getting a team like russia its tough to get a 3 0 sweep but we feel the longer we stay on the court the better chance we have of winning
6164065 its almost like theres more pressure in that game than there is in a semifinal or final
6164066 as of now theres no plan to be on the show
6164067 i think this country will be blessed if it happens and barack will have a strong strong ticket
6164068 then something cannot be right that theres no way he could lose
6164069 the plaintiff is just arbitrarily asking the court to set aside because it didnt go their way
6164070 speculative inference that jurors read news articles about the case during the trial
6164071 the trial court did not state a reason for granting a new trial
6164072 because a new trial in a jury tried case erodes the right to trial by jury minimal due process requires that a trial court state the reason a new trial is granted
6164073 the right of the people to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated

6164097 we identify each experimental configuration by the triplet data set size number of back end servers population size we have measured data for thirty six different configurations we observe that the service time at front end increases linearly with the number of back end servers which is intuitive as more back end means more work for the front end which needs to send and receive data from all the back ends

6164109 given the experimental evaluations to date we have serious doubts about how well mapreduce applications can scale
6164110 the map is indexed by a row key column key and a timestamp
6164111 roads are good everyone knows that why would you throw them away
6164112 to draw an analogy to sql map is like the group by clause of an aggregate query
6164113 relational databases have a query optimizer to decide whether to use an index or perform a brute force sequential search mapreduce has no indexes and therefore has only brute force as a processing option
6164114 skew is a huge impediment to achieving successful scale up in parallel query systems
6164115 it is exciting to see a much larger community engaged in the design and implementation of scalable query processing techniques

6164125 by executing these inevitable changes now we secured more players as part of our focus towards building a deeper stronger inventory of young talent
6164126 unfortunately the team has not played up to our expectations and we have sustained injuries to key players within our starting lineup and rotation
6164127 your continued trust and patience as we build the roster that will get us back on top
6164128 while the run production generated by these two veterans will not be quickly replaced we chose to endure the short term ramifications for the sake of building a strong competitive team for 2009 and many seasons to come
6164129 the vast majority of our 50 draft picks were signed culminating last week with first rounder yonder alonso and a pair of talented pitchers our expanded scouting operations also signed juan duran from the dominican republic and yorman rodriguez from venezuela who are arguably the best amateur free agent position players from their respective countries
6164130 as we near september we will continue to provide valuable playing time to our young players and new acquisitions who we feel can become significant contributors at the major league level we ask your continued trust and patience as we build the roster that will get us back on top

6164148 well weve learned a lot and i think weve improved a lot and this is a way to reconnect with them
6164149 i think its wonderful that theyre going to reach out and offer assistance to families that may need it but i really never expected anything from the army so getting this letter was a surprise

6164158 last summer the usgs scientists had found this hot spring that contained a microbial mat which is a thin structure containing various bacteria these bacteria appeared to be photosynthetic
6164159 the significance comes when you look at how widespread arsenic is in nature
6164160 its present in a lot of ground water and a lot of other things so it could be driving photosynthesis that weve never been aware of until this discovery
6164161 arsenic isnt as common as water which green plants use as an electron donor but our findings reveal a much greater diversity in photosynthesis which is the most important process on earth were all dependent on it for life
6164162 when you do field studies like this theyre not absolutely controlled and unequivocal experiments because you dont know everything thats in there
6164163 we demonstrated the organism could grow in culture with just carbon dioxide and arsenite which proved the process seen back at the lake
6164164 where it got its ability to use arsenite for photosynthesis we dont know
6164165 we thought it was a significant discovery but you never know when you submit it to science
6164166 we thought it was important because it added to that very short list of electron donors and really opens up new possibilities for photosynthesis and expands its diversity and i think thats what caught sciences eye
6164167 photosynthesis was invented by bacteria and only picked up by green plants and algae later on where it was expanded and made more complex
6164168 this is an ancient form of photosynthesis there are still little habitats on earth where these organisms can survive and we kind of stumbled into one
6164169 well many of the songs they arent sad theyre hopeless
6164170 i have quite a few businessmen and businesswomen who train here and boxing is an addictive type of sport its like whats next what can i do the logical conclusion in boxing is that you have competition and with competition people will continue to stay in my gym and continue to pay me my monthly dues when they get frustrated and say well this is great but what else am i gonna do then theyll go look for another sport so the shows help retain customers in my gym and then the amount we make helps me with my rent
6164171 the trophies cost me 18 i charged 20 and you paid for your own trophy
6164172 the commission was aware of them and looked the other way
6164173 they were contained in the gyms only gym members were doing it it was helping to support the local gyms so there was no major problem
6164174 the best feeling that ill come away from all this with is such a sense of pride in the way our athletes have conducted their business
6164175 it looks like everybody in the race has stolen a womans handbag and theyre running away over bushes and into their neighbors little plastic pools
6164176 im afraid that the next olympics theyre going to sell my job to somebody and make a million dollars off it
6164177 ive done a lot of olympics but certainly nothing ever like this of all of the games ive never been to anything like this and ive come to china twice before the games started for a couple weeks each time just to do features and stories and all that so i had a sense of what it would be like but then the games started and its just been a magnificent experience for me
6164178 my sister called me up a couple a days ago she was watching team handball she had never before seen it and she wanted to know what sport that was where they were cheating in soccer i was watching it with her trying to explain whats going on you know theres just some crazy sports the steeplechase its the nuttiest sport youve ever seen it looks like everybody in the race has stolen a womans handbag and theyre running away over bushes and into their neighbors little plastic pools youre thinking to yourself how did they train how did they get here how do you train for something that bizarre the nice thing about being at the broadcast center 15 hours a day is that you actually get to follow these stories and keep up with them
6164179 the nbc thing is obviously very exciting because of the super bowl for me i live and breathe sports i wish i had a broader view of the world but i dont im going to go from the olympics to begin the nfl season through to the super bowl at the end of the season so this is going to be a great great fall for me i cant wait for it to get started
6164180 im having so much fun doing this and ill tell you why i am not an expert on anything here i ran track and played a little basketball but theyre not lining me up to be the color analyst for anything essentially what they wanted me to do was to come be a fan im like willy wonka in the chocolate factory i got the golden ticket im afraid that the next olympics theyre going to sell my job to somebody and make a million dollars off it ive been able to go anywhere do anything meet almost any athlete that i want to meet ive had a chance to watch coach ks practices in basketball which for me is a thrill i feel like im watching it with the american public at home and going boy i would really like to sit next to debbie phelps michael phelps mom and listen to what she says while a race is going on i hope it looks like im having a good time over here because i am
6164181 out of all the things that ive been associated with here at these games the best feeling that ill come away from all this with is such a sense of pride in the way our athletes have conducted their business there has been nothing but first class kids from top to bottom representing our country it gives me a great sense of pride as i get a chance to go out and meet them
6164182 whats really thrilling whats fun to watch is someone like kobe bryant you figure that guy has seen everything and felt everything and done everything but hes running around going to soccer games watching his buddies from different countries and watching womens beach volleyball and giving interviews in italian and then you come to understand how big a deal it is for the athletes even the pros who are millionaires many times over and have all kinds of fame and wealth that they get excited watching these other athletes from these other countries as well its pretty cool
6164183 the softball team for me is a very likeable team these american women are so dominant unfortunately for them it has hurt their sport that theyre so much better than everybody else ive gotten a chance to meet some of those players over the years and theres something really special about them i feel really badly for them because theyve sort of got lumped in with the baseball guys and i think they are suffering because of that and now theyre fighting to keep their sport alive
6164184 i know i wouldnt want to play defensive back when he is coming off the ball id put my biggest guy out there to knock him around
6164185 its amazing that the two olympics that ive gotten to work were michael johnson and now usain bolt the most dominant sprinter in the history of the world
6164186 i guess my children within seconds of me eating bizarre foods they both got dozens of text messages that said your mom just ate a scorpion on television that one seemed to get a lot of attention
6164187 my favorite one of marys pieces was when she had the acupuncture and she had the dude that rolled up the big cigar and it had a bit of an aroma to it and mary thought it was the needle sticking in her arm that made her feel better
6164188 its really kind of hard to put into words unless you were here to really get a feel for it i think that obviously the opening ceremony were so moving so emotional the next night i go off to the usa versus china basketball game and you could feel from the inner part of their soul the chinese crowd who were so proud of the opening ceremony from the night before singing their national anthem at the top of their lungs even the americans had tears in their eyes its one of those remarkable things and i think until ive actually had a chance to go to see a lot of different kinds of events that you dont understand you always sort of get those chills when you hear the star spangled banner played and what it means to you when you see an american up there with tears in their eyes the more events that you go to like at the swimming venue at the track and field venue whatever it is the same emotions come through for me when im watching somebody from latvia win an event and they have tears in their eyes and their emotion all the little stories that come out of these games parents are crying because their kids made it to the semifinals or whatever the case may be and i got a chance to sit with debbie phelps during the games and watch the raw emotion of that family as they suffered through eight gold medals if you can suffer through eight gold medals just to see and live and experience this thing has been one of the really big thrills of my life
6164189 international growth is one of our key strategic priorities and that includes boosting our ability to create programming for specific local audiences around the world this acquisition will jump start our efforts in the very important uk market carnival has a great track record and we are excited about helping this first class operation become even more successful
6164190 this exciting agreement represents a further step towards our goal of complementing our quality brands with the capacity to produce quality compelling local tv content with global appeal
6164191 i am excited to bring the company into the global brand that is nbc universal under this groundbreaking deal which offers great strategic opportunities for carnival and all the talent who work with us as a unique production model in the uk i believe we will have so much to bring to our broadcaster relationships and the creative community equally as a production base for nbc universal outside of north america we will be an important asset for our new parent i am very much looking forward to working with pete and angela and to helping grow an international creative business centred here in the uk
6164192 carnival is a highly respected tv production operation and we are delighted to welcome them into the nbc universal fold we feel this deal will prove an excellent strategic fit and present abundant international growth opportunities into the future
6164193 the guy came out and made the best olympics of my lifetime
6164194 to me bolt is like what michael phelps is to swimming
6164195 at the start of second half we wanted to come out and we had a particular set we wanted to run i had a lot of good looks and knocked them down
6164196 just five years ago last week on august 14th 2003 this country got an object lesson in how big a gamble were taking with our future if we dont change course
6164197 we learned that this time the enemy was us and our failure to take care of our infrastructure
6164198 the worlds greatest nation was shown to have a power grid that was seriously over strained and out of date
6164199 i believe that weve got to be willing to do what some other nations such as france have already done and increase our capacity of safe and clean nuclear generated power
6164200 draw power from the tides of the hudson and east rivers something were already doing on a pilot basis
6164201 which weve estimated could meet nearly 20 percent of the citys need for electricity

6164204 want to live a little longer get a second wife a study reported in new scientist suggests that
6164205 theyre giving me the opportunity so im going to take it
6164206 it was definitely part of the decision growing up with those guys and playing baseball with them
6164207 everyone you play is good and youve got to bring your a game every time you play
6164208 theyre going to give me the opportunity to pitch whether its over the weekend middle of the week or out of the bullpen ill do whatever i can do to help a amp m win

6164212 we want to apologize to nascar all of our partners all of our families at jgr and all of our fans for the unfortunate incident that took place this past weekend in michigan with our two nationwide teams
6164213 a poor decision was made by some key members of our organization and 100 percent of the blame rests with us
6164214 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6164215 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment in attempting to alter the results of nascars dyno test following saturdays nationwide series race in michigan
6164216 although in no way was anything done that might have altered the race outcome these jgr employees attempted to circumvent the nascar rule book and that is unacceptable

6164226 if one thing offers a terrifying glimpse of where the experiment in human despair that is gaza under israeli siege is leading it is the news that a palestinian woman in her 60s a grandmother chose last week to strap on a suicide belt and explode herself next to a group of israeli soldiers invading her refugee camp
6164227 just at the moment fatma was choosing death and resistance over powerlessness and victimhood and at a time when gaza is struggling through one of the most oppressive and ugly periods of israeli occupation in nearly four decades human rights watch hrw published its latest statement on the conflict
6164228 noting almost as an afterthought that more than 1 500 palestinians have been made homeless by these demolitions in the past few months and that 105 houses have been destroyed from the air the press release denounces palestinian attempts at non violent and collective action to halt the israel attacks hrw refers in particular to three incidents
6164229 there is a good reason to believe this reading of international law is patently wrong if not kafkaesque
6164230 human rights watch also applies a series of terrible double standards in this press release

6164232 i saw my doctor today hes the frcp mrcp ba ma mbbs head of neuro cardiac ent gastro medicine at the biggest hospital in our city he says i need to up the dosage of my cholesterol meds
6164233 ah well its our age i saw my doctor the other day hes the frcp mrcp ba ma mbbs mallb head of neuro cardiac ent gastro pediatric medicine at the biggest hospital in the next town over from yours he used to work in america and teach at harvard and when he wanted to leave they begged him not to go and even offered to give his wife a job but he said his roots are here so he told me that my cholesterol and my blood pressure are both up and i need to increase my dosage
6164234 oh really harvard is it and he lives in the next town not ours one of these young fellows i suppose very eccentric these fellows all kinds of ideas my doctor is a more experienced man england returned you know he was personal physician to the mayor of london maybe even the queen but hes very modest they wanted to knight him but he refused because hes one of those old fashioned patriots you know hes also a millionaire and married to the daughter of the man who owns the hospital half the doctors who work there used to work in america now they all get fabulous salaries to work there of course none of them gets paid what he does theyd all pee on their shoes if he even looked at them
6164235 my doctor doesnt like to live in the big city he likes to live in our town because you know how your city is these days too many people too much crime pollution he came back specially to work here he used to treat george bush but after a while he decided hed rather serve the poor at home he has principles and of course he doesnt need any money his father and his grandfather and his great grandfather were all famous doctors his father used to charge 100 rupees in the 1950s and still every morning his garden was full of waiting people whod come from far and wide to consult him
6164236 ah yes my doctor is like that he charges 500 rupees for a ten minute consultation he doesnt even do anything in that time but look at you and ask you what is wrong with you oh what beautiful manners he has very much a gentleman then hell listen to your heart and tell you what tests you must take and then hell cure you 100 and all of those tests are very expensive theyre not for just anybody oh no you have to be somebody before hell examine you and when he does examine you he wont touch you with his hands hell always wear gloves which he throws away once theyve been used
6164237 i thought blogging would be the same as when i used to have messenger i only had 3 or 4 people who could get on it and i thought youd be able to do the same with blogging i guess anyone can get on because ive heard from more than one person they thought i should know it seems terrible that you went through that on saturday morning and your family didnt know

6164262 we can never be surprised at what vile evil comes from the mouth of a confessed victim of child abuse at the hands of her own parents

6164284 thats not my decision to judge where im at right now i just know that im giving it my all and im working hard to compete and earn a roster spot its a good competition at the receiver spot and everybody is pushing each other making us all better
6164285 when you put more police on the streets when you have specific initiatives designed to go after specific types of offences those are two of many circumstances that result in increased numbers
6164286 at one time you would never hear of a robbery a daylight robbery at a bank was unheard of
6164287 now nobody gets too excited about it knocking off a macs milk store thats more common today than it was years ago
6164288 people do move here to get away from the city because they feel when theyre in the city youve got more violence more crimes and more of a chance of getting hurt
6164289 times have changed and were trying to keep up with them
6164290 it challenges the myth that cities are violent and rural areas are not
6164291 in huron county they were totally outraged because the people were such fine upstanding citizens they didnt deserve a death like that
6164292 people feel like theyve really been intruded upon because its not the way of life up here
6164293 its really a country feeling we have people come here because they want out of the rat race and a slower pace
6164294 its almost like an arms war at one point in time a good old fashioned fist fight may have been the way differences were sorted out
6164295 the increase in violence goes hand in hand with the need to arm oneself to have the advantage if you want to have the upper hand you go with the biggest gun guns are in the hands of young people and thats because they are actively seeking them
6164296 all kinds of crime is going on but it only becomes officially crime when police charge someone
6164297 it does depend upon the focus of police with weapons charges it might relate to a concentrated focus of police activity
6164298 instead what were seeing is a steady trend line up
6164299 what weve done is moved the crime up along various highways out of the gta and weve moved it into some of these communities where theyve never heard of anybody being arrested with a gun now its routine its had a devastating impact
6164300 we need a guns and gangs initiative thats pan provincial that really understands that handgun and gang activity is as dangerous in small town and rural ontario as it is in toronto

6164346 soaked up and ate up anything he could read on new zealands athletics past
6164347 ive read no bugles no drums by peter snell and the john walker book and kiwis can fly that chronicled john walkers dick quaxs and rod dixons european tours and ive just been given the new jack lovelock book by the editor
6164348 i love to learn as much as i can about he sport im both a student an athlete myself and a fan willis was touched to get messages from rogers between his races in beijing and was buoyed to read walker felt he had the speed and strength to win and had put 20 on him at the tab
6164349 in our range of abilities right from the 800 through to the 5000m

6164357 i was trying to win gold but the main focus was not coming away with nothing
6164358 there was a lot of pumping going down and no time to breathe throughout the race i was just destroyed at the end
6164359 thankfully the guys behind me werent able to catch me i thought they were going to at one stage but i held on
6164360 i was stressing the whole race i was never confident in sailing conditions like today anything could happen
6164361 i was a little bit emotional but not as much as i expected ive been on verge of tears for the last 24 hours but the relief of winning killed a bit of that
6164362 all through last night and this morning i was pretty nervous it was a pretty stressful day and a stressful race
6164363 nick shouted a little bit and made it look closer than it was but it wasnt an issue he had a bit of nerves and made a bigger deal of it than it should have been and i figured that stage he was broken and struggling a little bit
6164364 in the end i decided to let the israeli guy go and concentrate on covering the french and british guys
6164365 obviously a very bright boy as hes computing a lot as he goes along
6164366 i had followed windsurfing through barbara kendall and aaron mcintosh but my plan had been to go laser sailing i guess it was a push into the sport but not in a pushy way i just loved it straight away its a really fantastic sport
6164367 this has gone as well as it could have gone but i dont know if ill be carrying on i do love what i do but id really like to go to university to study law at some stage and my nature is to be all or nothing so if i did that id want to give it 100 per cent
6164368 i wont say ive lived like a monk for the last little while but ive been really focused and i need to think about everything
6164369 he managed to get on to the water they smuggled him on to a press boat which was pretty cool
6164370 you have to be a bit psycho to be the best at this sport and he is i mean psycho in a nice way hes intensely focused
6164371 after being subjected to decades of booty shaking videos and 1970s sitcom reruns this is what the black community needs better black television
6164372 they should have just called it bmtv since all it does for programming is take a great mtv show and then do a watered down colored version
6164373 its sort of the television version of a puffy combs remix
6164374 but also black folks are always talking about how we should be uplifting the race with our programming if a little booty doesnt uplift you i dont know what will
6164375 i had the inside scoop before the mainstream media did bet has done a great disservice to our people by not reporting on trifling stories such as this thank god for
6164376 i thought our audience would be satisfied with hour after hour of music videos and knockoffs like baldwin hills
6164377 its pretty likely that im going to be going back next year nothings signed and sealed yet but its looking pretty promising
6164378 its something i really want to do so im pretty excited itll definitely be a big team but ill just be happy to sign the contract
6164379 with a few years a bit of maturity comes i stumbled on all that pro stuff at a very young age i was very green when i first went to europe
6164380 i did it all by myself so it wasnt easy there were a lot of pressures and a bit of stress involved the big big difference now is that im pretty happy
6164381 i think these guys have got a couple of options
6164382 the way new zealand cycling is forming at the moment there could actually be a team within new zealand cycling that go to europe but still with a track focus
6164383 something like that would be fantastic theres a little bit of talk about that now to do that then you would keep hold of the guys
6164384 all of them are so talented that its not going to be long that word is out that these guys have got engines
6164385 among the causes of homosexuality is a contagious demonic factor
6164386 extreme secular humanism atheist scientism is comparable to rational satanism
6164387 as long as i can play basketball thats the most important thing to me
6164388 if its not here then i have to work for it to be somewhere else
6164389 a conductor or the principal performer in an orchestral section
6164390 hes made these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6164391 im going to end this war and im going to bring them home and theyll come home with honor and victory
6164392 would like to see the united states provide assistance to the georgian military self defense equipment that will help them defend and deter against russian aggression in the future
6164393 we asked them what security needs they had and they were quite specific and quite defined
6164394 were not going to let this aggression stand the world is behind you
6164395 we cant let a bully do this because if they do it here theyll do it other places and if we dont stop it here well have to stop it in a much more difficult way
6164396 not going to prevent the american people from helping you

6164400 even though weve seen a decline in our developer checks weve seen a steady enrollment increase

6164402 going back two years ago our checks were significantly larger
6164403 our good intimate leroi moore passed upon and gave his ghost up today and we demise miss him forever
6164404 we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
6164405 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
6164406 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6164407 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6164408 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to george bush
6164409 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6164410 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6164411 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6164412 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6164413 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today
6164414 all campaigns have to have a clear strategy theme and message and this is a pretty strong one i think theyll keep hammering at it

6164430 pauls like iverson 2 0 but newer and more functional
6164431 comparing cp3 to iverson is awful they are not similar at all besides the fact that you both enjoy watching them both theres no comparison there and i dont want to hear it anymore
6164432 i agree with pat very different styles of basketball i never meant to compare the 2 i was just pointing out the fact that i used to love to watch ai and now its cp3 their main similarity is that they are both really quick and really good off the dribble and theyre small i think cp3 is more like steve nash with quickness and explosiveness than he is a version of ai
6164433 hes my little man i like his overall game everything about it his team has the best record so id give the mvp to him he can handle the ball he can shoot it he can finish he has the ball in his hands pretty much 99 percent of the time every possession hes starting the offense so its tough to deal with
6164434 i really try to do is take different pages out of different players books
6164435 the countrys supply chain might be assisted by the purchase of port of tauranga business by ports of auckland
6164436 be assured we have had nothing more substantive that exists in their statement
6164437 new zealand needs world class port infrastructure and a logical approach to future investment in the port and intermodal sectors
6164438 a rough and ready calculation would suggest that port of taurangas container business would be worth substantially more than ports of aucklands container business

6164448 for many local people they will not be able to travel long distances to use other post offices especially in areas where there are poor public transport links

6164515 if gods people desire to be on mission with him to accomplish his purposes they must understand his nature and his ways
6164516 anytime god gives a command he has already provided for its accomplishment
6164517 we can easily make critical judgments and choices based on traditions old or new instead of looking to gods word as the plumb line of eternal truth
6164518 mercy always humbles us grace does not forgiveness reflects the love of god however our focus in these days is too often on the grace of god when it needs to be on the mercy of god grace follows mercy and mercy follows repentance
6164519 when god speaks he is already in the process of doing what he says
6164520 faith is the confident expectation that god will do what he has said he will do
6164521 the secret of the lord is with those who fear him and it is they to whom he will show his covenant trust in god is greater higher and more certain than the greatest trust humans can experience with one another it is based on the nature of god
6164522 anywhere god puts his presence is sacred set apart holy and completely dedicated to his use
6164523 holiness carries with it the idea of separation or being set apart from the ordinary holiness is more than separation from sin holiness is the moral excellence of god
6164524 a holy life is not an ascetic or gloomy life but a life lived by divine truth
6164525 truth is always narrow and specific but it is gods way to life the choices people make often bring the smell of success but fail in the light of truth
6164526 what the world would discount as too small to matter can grow to be something quite significant in gods hands nothing is too small in fact when his glory is revealed he often uses what would seem foolish to confound the worlds wisdom
6164527 if we know god and his ways we can be channels of spiritual stability and life to those around us because of gods presence in us ezek 36 27
6164528 if we are allowing the holy spirit to minister through us we must say gently and firmly that there is no middle ground there is no partial obedience partial obedience is disobedience disobedience is sin and leads to further sin instead of a godly life
6164529 never in your life will god ever express his will toward you in any way other than as an expression of perfect love
6164530 love is always an activity of the ways of god god expresses himself very practically reminding and teaching his people to love him and obey him in the relationship of love he brings them assignments
6164531 those in whom jesus christ dwells live right next to the lives of others who are broken hopeless and helpless that is because jesus christ who is perfect love flows out to others through the lives of those who know him and know his love the salt of a christians life is the person of jesus christ
6164532 gods love provided us with his word but others may not hear what you say unless gods love is flowing through you
6164533 wherever jesus is fully and freely allowed to work through the lives of believers he drives out the darkness and replaces death with life
6164534 discipline means teaching and disciples are those being taught as a disciple the discipline of god steers you to gods best and prepares you for ultimate judgment

6164699 this equity could grow dramatically if the results of dr schatzbergs government sponsored research find that mifepristone could be used to treat psychotic major depression
6164700 despite our belief that stanford nimh and dr schatzberg have handled this grant in accordance with the regulations and applicable policies and with due regard for the integrity of the research we can see how having dr schatzberg continue as principal investigator on the grant can create an appearance of conflict of interest
6164701 therefore stanford university with the concurrence of dr schatzberg is temporarily appointing another principal investigator on this grant and we have so advised nimh

6164706 i reread the 4 guidelines and still have heartburn with number 3 heres why when the cultural group that you are not a part of invites your participation because of your professionalism ability to think critically and be reasonable and consider all options then grab the chance to be a part of the discussion and vote it ties in with your number 1 rule beautifully if members of the cultural group are hotly contesting each others opinions you may want to offer advice or try to find some sort of common ground in which they can agree and then vote for the compromise the castro is a neighborhood finding its identity currently as a result of all of the changes that have been happening in the last 10 years no make that 20 years and is not exclusively owned by the glbt community as dt is also not owned by the gay community either that is the strength of our board in that we represent all members of the community it is like saying that white congress folks shouldnt vote on black issues such as welfare and education it just doesnt jibe with the role of a functioning decision making body representing all views duboce triangle is a part of the castro and you are a part of duboce triangle so you are part of the castro too
6164707 we found that survival for teenagers and young people with cancer improved overall from 63 per cent between 1979 and 1984 to 74 per cent between 1996 and 2001 which is great news but more needs to be done to drive this figure even higher
6164708 its important that cancer services are tailored to suit teenagers and young adults as their needs differ from older adults and children clinically and psychologically research like this is needed to measure how much of an impact this tailored treatment could have
6164709 our research has also identified cancers where survival rates remain poor highlighting the need for continuing research in those areas to drive up survival
6164710 research like this is vital if we are to measure the impact of changes to the way teenagers with cancer are treated recruiting more young people on to clinical trials which has been a priority for childhood cancer will help this
6164711 its important that this group of patients receive the most appropriate treatment and cancer research uk will continue investing in research to work towards this goal

6164759 the leading economists of the day feared that if workers understood marxist theory the working class would realize how badly they were being exploited
6164760 fearing this might lead to revolutionary fervor economists sought to recast economic theory to neutralize the marxist critique they limited their neoclassical theory to looking at innocuous issues such as how prices change they also sought to prove that everyone gets paid exactly in accordance with their net contribution to society implying that workers arent exploited and that is no basis for workers to claim a fairer share of the pie

6164792 boils down to about six headlines repeated over and over and over
6164793 there were other events happening in the world that most americans heard nothing about
6164794 you know when i was young this world had rules and standards and liberals did not get tv shows and liberals who had tv shows did not write on dailykos and liberals who had tv shows and wrote on daily kos did not get tv shows for their even more liberal guest hosts
6164795 has all but settled on his choice for a running mate and set an elaborate rollout plan for his decision beginning with an early morning alert to supporters perhaps as soon as wednesday morning
6164796 all but reached his decision while on vacation in hawaii
6164797 referring to a response given by sen john mccain at the saddleback civil forum on the presidency fox news gretchen carlson asserted that he doesnt like to talk about when he was a pow in fact mccain has repeatedly highlighted his experience as a pow even as he and the media have promoted the notion that he is reluctant to do so
6164798 wherever george packer travels he finds people yearning for the united states to bomb them
6164799 the only solution is for the u s to drop a bomb on naypyidaw thats the only way ninety per cent of burmese would tell you the same thing the world is very angry at america because of iraq if you use one per cent of the money and one per cent of the bombs here the world will see you in a better way
6164800 thus for example there is her exceedingly weird obsession with being the person to break the story of a presidential nominees choice for his running mate
6164801 this seemed like a very pro obama crowd to me but mccain just walked on stage and people were very enthusiastic in the welcome

6164815 i n leaving born babies to die without treatment christ hospital was doing nothing illegal under the laws of illinois
6164816 w hat they were alleging were violations of existing law we took the allegations very seriously
6164817 shafer told me that the 1999 investigation reviewed logs personnel files and medical records
6164818 because what they were alleging were violations of existing law
6164819 the allegation that infants were allowed to expire in a utility room could not be substantiated and all staff interviewed denied that any infant was ever left alone
6164820 this is not true such measures were not already the law in illinois not according to the department of public health not according to attorney general ryan
6164821 s uch measures were not already the law in illinois
6164822 hospital officials dismissed staneks concerns she then approached the republican attorney general of illinois jim ryan who issued a finding several months later that christ hospital was doing nothing illegal under the laws of illinois doctors had no ethical or legal obligation to treat these premature babies they had passed the bright line of birth that had effectively limited the right to life since the roe v wade decision but under the law they were non persons
6164823 d octors had no ethical or legal obligation to treat these premature babies

6164833 f as in fat how obesity policies are failing in america 2008
6164834 the obesity epidemic is lowering our productivity and dramatically increasing our health care costs
6164835 i think it helps create some awareness among the public and officials and it brings it to the awareness of public officials
6164836 i dont know many people as individuals who will look at it and think they should eat better but i think its important for businesses to have an awareness because they can play an important role in peoples lives
6164837 it would be helpful to have some state leadership on this
6164838 because obesity does put you at risk of other health issues there needs to be some kind of solution between state leadership and local communities that could lead to more advocacy
6164839 we try to help people with the issues of how to eat right and its not rocket science but it is hard for people with stressful and busy lifestyles
6164840 people eat fast food and not really think about the calories and nutrition they are eating
6164841 so i hope its more like what i would expect from his style
6164842 its been fun ive spent the last year of my life singing other peoples songs at this stage its not looking too promising having his performances from the show on his album i definitely want to progress past that and be an artist
6164843 an international security mission should be deployed to help protect civilians and create a safe environment for the displaced to return home and international organizations should also send fact finding missions to establish the facts report on human rights and urge the authorities to account for any crimes
6164844 it means that the third ddg 1000 ship is very likely to go forward and yet theres also the potential of building more ddg 51s
6164845 this plan will provide stability of the industrial base and continue the development of advanced surface ship technologies such as radar systems stealth magnetic and acoustic quieting and automated damage control
6164846 were trying not to provoke them otherwise theyll stay here for five to six months
6164847 both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increase and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6164848 were not going to let this aggression stand the world is behind you
6164849 we cant let a bully do this because if they do it here theyll do it other places and if we dont stop it here well have to stop it in a much more difficult way
6164850 not going to prevent the american people from helping you
6164851 the people of abkhazia intend to ask the russian leadership to recognise abkhazia
6164852 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6164853 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6164854 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6164855 will help both the alliance and poland and the united states respond to the coming threats
6164856 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6164857 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6164858 in troubled times the most important thing is to have friends
6164859 but it is more important to have friends who share your values and your aspirations and your dreams and poland and the united states are those kind of friends
6164860 if it had to be done again i would do it
6164861 the work you are doing here is vital i say that to your comrades in europe because there are soldiers from the whole of europe here
6164862 the best way of remaining faithful to your comrades is to continue the work to lift your heads to be professional
6164863 a part of the worlds freedom is at stake here this is where the fight against terrorism is being waged
6164864 were going to make sure that the means are put in place to ensure that this doesnt happen again
6164865 we should not make precipitous choices because of this drama we must redefine the mission and set precise goals
6164866 if the aims are just are the tactics being used to achieve them correct
6164867 unless we do that pay more attention we will continue to suffer
6164868 it should be in every rucksack for those times when soldiers need spiritual energy
6164869 in the process of securing comments for recommending the book i believe there was a basic misunderstanding on my part that the comments were publishable
6164870 were intended for me personally rather than for the general public
6164871 and unless someone like military com notes it we would not be aware of it
6164872 we dont get the stateside papers in baghdad and i doubt very much that gen petraeus goes to amazon com much if at all
6164873 mrff is now officially putting both army chaplain lt col bill mccoy and general petraeus on notice not to destroy any of the written or electronic records of their communications about this issue
6164874 general petraeus has by his own hand become a quintessential poster child of this fundamentalist christian religious predation via his unadulterated and shocking public endorsement of a book touting both christian supremacy and exceptionalism
6164875 he should still be relieved of duty and court martialed
6164876 so the icece would support what general patreaus has done
6164877 agenda to be more important than the units agenda and thus lead to unit failure
6164878 no one else has written a book which allows for varying world views and perspectives while suggesting the gospel might have an idea worth considering under orders does just that
6164879 shes a great lady and weve done so much together
6164880 i hope shes going to be ok i hope the good lord sees her through this
6164881 ill look at you and say its the happiest ive ever been mixtape
6164882 canada has an established custom of accommodating sincerely held religious and conscientious convictions as much as possible
6164883 the expectation that physicians must set aside their beliefs with regard to treatments or referrals that violate their conscience is unreasonable
6164884 offer the best possible protection for freedom of religion and freedom of conscience for all concerned
6164885 would appear to severely limit the freedom of ontario physicians to practice according to their conscientious religious beliefs
6164886 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6164887 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice
6164888 as they live their lives they really do not become very involved with government
6164889 one family doesnt go there is a group of them that goes like two or three or four
6164890 they can continue to let people know were here come visit us how the land is the orchards do great or whatever
6164891 an amish woman said we joke among ourselves if we keep growing at this rate soon half the world will be amish and the other half will be taxi drivers
6164892 our goal is to get the greatest recovery possible on loans in default or in danger of default while helping troubled borrowers remain in their homes
6164893 bill c 484 endangers abortion rights and womens rights by establishing fetal personhood
6164894 the most deeply worrying aspect of what ms arthur and her co advocates against bill c 484 are doing in flooding the public square with such articles is that the public and members of parliament who have an especially important role to play in this debate might not realize the serious errors of law in ms arthurs arguments
6164895 bill c 484 does not make the fetus a person as arcc claims
6164896 it does recognize the existence of the fetus as a number of presently existing laws already do including the criminal code and tort law
6164897 importantly bill c 484 if it were to become law would in fact not affect the law on abortion nor would it criminalize pregnant women for any harm they may cause to their own fetuses unborn children c 484 is only about abortion for those abortion rights advocates who are so extreme in their views that they cannot get past their strident ideology to feel any compassion for a woman who is such a tragic victim
6164898 ms arthur and arcc claim to be the great defenders of womens rights and yet by opposing bill c 484 they are robbing women of the added protection in criminal law of bringing their children safely into the world they are denying justice to the woman who has been victimized by a brutal crime one which has violently taken her yet to be born but very much wanted child from her womb how can ms arthur and arcc claim to speak for women when they work so hard to rob such a violated woman of basic human compassion and justice
6164899 the majority of canadians including the majority of canadian women across the country as demonstrated by three national polls support this legislation they see the bill for what it really is a sincere effort to support women who make the choice to bring their wanted child into the world in safety

6165051 that heart failure becomes more and more problematic as people live longer
6165052 their admission rate goes down significantly with infusion theres some people who arent even admitted once a year even
6165053 the indirect cost saving also comes because people who were nonfunctional become functional so it saves society money
6165054 this person was bedridden completely and he died three years ago not because of his heart but because of cancer
6165055 we got a lot of calls thinking we were closing the whole office

6165090 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
6165091 greatest shortcoming has been a tendency to not devote itself

6165104 during the dinner mary kate was very playful with joel it was all fun and games but with the olsens nothing is as simple as that nicole exploded at joel and demanded that they leave the party afterward nicole warned him to stay away from mary kate

6165109 companies are recognizing a movement afoot but im not sure this sale says much about that
6165110 i did once say that to me art and the saints are the greatest apologetic for our faith
6165111 the arguments contributed by reason are unquestionably important and indispensable but then there is always dissent somewhere
6165112 on the other hand if we look at the saints this great luminous trail on which god passed through history we see that there truly is a force of good that resists the millennia likewise if we contemplate the beauties created by faith they are simply i would say the living proof of faith
6165113 it speaks to us itself and on the basis of the cathedrals beauty we succeed in visibly proclaiming god christ and all his mysteries here they have acquired a form and look at us
6165114 are all a luminous sign of god and therefore truly a manifestation an epiphany of god
6165115 i think the great music born in the church makes the truth of our faith audible and perceivable
6165116 in listening to all these works we suddenly understand it is true wherever such things are born the truth is there without an intuition that discovers the true creative center of the world such beauty cannot be born
6165117 when in our epoch we discuss the reasonableness of faith we discuss precisely the fact that reason does not end where experimental discoveries end it does not finish in positivism
6165118 the theory of evolution sees the truth but sees only half the truth it does not see that behind it is the spirit of the creation we are fighting to expand reason and hence for a reason which precisely is also open to the beautiful and does not have to set it aside as something quite different and unreasonable
6165119 i t is the artistic expression of a greatly expanded reason in which heart and reason encounter each other this is the point i believe that in a certain way this is proof of the truth of christianity heart and reason encounter one another beauty and truth converge and the more that we ourselves succeed in living in the beauty of truth the more that faith will be able to return to being creative in our time too and to express itself in a convincing form of art

6165125 between relentless price hikes in food and energy flat paychecks and falling home prices family budgets are deeply stressed

6165145 she underwent lumpectomy and then when she got the information back from the genetic testing she was able to have a little time to discern what this all meant and then she went forward to have the prophylactic mastectomies which are clearly the best treatment to reduce her risk of ever developing breast cancer again by at least 90
6165146 it may not be right for every patient but i think especially if you have this genetic mutation its such a highly active mutation in terms of increasing the risk of breast cancer that its certainly something that i would recommend to one of my family members or to my patients and i do
6165147 because her risk of an additional breast cancer is extremely high in the range of one in two why take a chance

6165152 we believe a female was involved in this but weve not made an arrest
6165153 there really is too much crap on the side of our refrigerator if something were to happen to the toaster it could be a problem
6165154 i really do believe that promoting brown fat growth is a plausible approach to weight control
6165155 to me it is attractive because of its simplicity if more of our fat were brown fat the mouse studies suggest that we would be leaner and better able to resist obesity
6165156 we showed that brown fat and white fat have completely different origins
6165157 brown fat is derived from muscle that was a huge surprise
6165158 the hope is that this research will lead to better ways to treat obesity especially for people who are overweight because of their genes
6165159 right now there are not many good options for these people
6165160 answers to these questions would take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
6165161 we know that we can stimulate the production of brown fat in mice
6165162 it is not unreasonable to think that we can also do this in humans
6165163 the weather has become an increasingly critical factor in the financial performance of companies across a variety of industries
6165164 by incorporating our information and research applications into the bloomberg terminal were providing the ability for investors traders and financial executives to easily integrate weather into their equity commodity and derivative strategies
6165165 we are pleased to provide this comprehensive set of weather based analytics to our customers

6165168 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice

6165172 we have a lot of neat programs for younger kids
6165173 it was a very impressive showing especially for their first time run at the section a finals
6165174 as far as the finals are concerned those that qualify are the fastest swimmers out of about 150 kids in the club we took 40 to the finals most teams only took 20 or so that in itself is a great achievement
6165175 everybody just had such a good time they made all sorts of new friends
6165176 the older kids were really good with the younger ones its amazing
6165177 they come from a very competitive swimming family and they know exactly what theyre doing they also have a good team of coaches in training
6165178 theyre calculating that they can take a shot at the 2020 olympics
6165179 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6165180 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6165181 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6165182 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6165183 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6165184 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6165185 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6165186 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6165187 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6165188 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6165189 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community

6165200 well weve learned a lot and i think weve improved a lot and this is a way to reconnect with them
6165201 i think its wonderful that theyre going to reach out and offer assistance to families that may need it but i really never expected anything from the army so getting this letter was a surprise
6165202 please be candid in your conversations with our staff as your comments and concerns are important to us
6165203 we understand the sacrifices you and your family have made in service to this nation and we want to assure you the army is here to provide you the support you need for as long as you desire

6165205 so i dragged chris to drowning by numbers even paid for it as the poor dear has spent away all her money afterward chris teased me about moaning oh no oh no during the movie ok i got into it good flicker great for halloween lovely weird little black comedy
6165206 good movie very poignant and the gay ness of the characters is not a theme but rather themes are duplicity and love and unrequited love and obsession and passion and so on
6165207 unusual weird rather more slowmoving than id have wished fairly faithful to the book
6165208 very well made a lot of lovely scenery and interesting faces in closeup although i could follow the motion of the plot could make out its bone structure yet the details were not always clear couldnt catch all the symbolism left me feeling oddly depressed

6165218 very strange yet exciting lyrical play filled with odd and wonderful imagery the set design nearly matching the words and when the words made no sense certainly surpassing them i loved the horses men with big horse heads dressed in leotards carrying trumpets juliet with a false bare chest pushing apart her negligee a naked man hanging from a cross who is attended by a male nurse a man dressed in bells another in grape leaves rain falling between audience and stage a huge painted eye a giant leaf a soft sculpture moon it was not really long an hour and a half yet so full it seemed much longer and confusing so that the minutes stretched out as we tried to peer into them
6165219 okay but i didnt find myself caring much about what happened to the characters except at the very end when spoiler alert the mother of the king of thebes discovers she has been carrying around her sons head felt for her poor dear the women of the chorus did a number of gross things to themselves during the course of the play splashing themselves with water painting themselves with lipstick amp eyebrow pencil wallowing in red wine and oatmeal simulated pagan rituals i suppose

6165231 therefore city blocks are just closed down to auto traffic for a few weeks and seattles line was up and running in december of last year just four years from the time it was conceived
6165232 streetcars allow for a downtown that prevents this conundrum once you build enough parking garages and parking lots and parking spots for a retail neighborhood to support purely automotive ingress theres no reason to go there anymore
6165233 while many u s cities had streetcars operating in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the majority of american cities dismantled their lines in the middle 20th century making way for the up and coming automobile
6165234 general motors firestone tire standard oil of california and phillips petroleum subsidiary corporation called national city lines which systematically dismantled americas streetcar and trolley system to impose the automobile on america and inadvertently climate change
6165235 despite public opinion polls that showed 88 percent of the public favoring expansion of the rail lines after world war ii ncl systematically closed its streetcars down until by 1955 only a few remained
6165236 weve got 90 percent of the market out there that we can turn into automobile users if we can eliminate the rail alternatives we will create a new market for our cars
6165237 the noisy foul smelling buses turned earlier patrons of the high speed rail system away from public transit and in effect sold millions of private automobiles

6165240 we figured a song by a band with real metal cred would do best for us this song never got the attention it deserved its an amazingly well written song and even though its not the most complex song nevermore has done it is in my opinion one of their best we ran the idea by nevermore and they gave us their blessing so we were very happy to have the original artists behind it i couldnt be happier with the way it came out

6165291 very likely the longest 2 meter qso via tropospheric propagation for either country
6165292 radio waves that are refracted by natural gradients in the index of refraction of air with altitude due to changes in temperature humidity and pressure
6165293 ducting takes place when refraction is so great that radio waves are bent back to the surface of the earth when tropospheric ducting conditions exist over a wide geographic area signals may remain very strong over distances of 1500 km 930 miles or more ducting results from the gradient created by a sharp increase in temperature with altitude quite the opposite of normal atmospheric conditions a simultaneous drop in humidity contributes to increased refractivity useful temperature inversions form between 250 and 2000 meters 800 6500 feet above ground the elevated inversion and the earths surface act something like the boundaries of a natural open ended waveguide radio waves of the right frequency range caught inside the duct will be propagated for long distances with relatively low losses several common weather conditions can create temperature inversions
6165294 went to bed at about 08 30 utc leaving the rig on and antennas pointing toward reunion i woke up at 00 15 utc and heard the beacon from my shack i went over and saw that signals were low even with the masthead pre amp on i was running to confirm hard copy of the signal but it was not decoding i switched off the pre amp and returned to bed about an hour later i heard the beacon again but much stronger so i went to the shack and saw the signal at almost 1 on the s meter perfect hard copy from cwget i contacted phil on his cell phone switched the linear and pre amp on and we logged a ssb qso and fm qso on 144 200 and 144 400 at 01 39 utc on august 14 with signal reports of 5 6 both ways
6165295 at 0135 utc on august 14 glenn is calling me on my cell phone that means the beacon is heard strong enough to allow a qso its 0535 local time here i speak low and run into the shack switch off the beacon and call on 144 200 to see glenns signal at 55 56 with the preamp we decide to try fm and i have clear copy on him time goes fast we stop the qso some 20 or 30 minutes later but the band was still nicely open the signal was crystal clear almost no fading if any on my side whooaaaa the first bridge is now there between south africa and reunion island
6165296 while operating there as zr2bi in the late 1970s i heard an unidentified south american station on 2 meters since then having moved to the us i was not able to pursue it any further this last january i started e mailing a lot of people in southern africa and st helena but found little activity pursuing the potential tropo resorting to my old ways of using fm broadcast stations as beacons i asked john turner on st helena island to listen for african stations within days he reported stations from angola then namibia and eventually as far south as cape town one february day he logged 25 south african fm broadcasters in 30 minutes and that was with his car radio
6165297 all those reports led to phil mondon putting up the beacon
6165298 the best known such duct is the hawaiian duct which links the west coast of the us especially california with the big island of hawaii but we have also known that other such ducts exist in different places around the world although the ham populations in these areas are often so low that we hardly ever experience two way communications the indian ocean is one such place this outstanding contact between phil mondon fr5dn on reunion island and glen kraut zs2gk in south africa confirms the existence of a path between the mainland and islands in the indian ocean it follows the detection of fm broadcast stations on similar paths in the south atlantic ocean between the island of st helena and angola namibia and capetown on the mainland and reports of reception of brazilian fm stations on ascension island in the south atlantic
6165299 now that the path is proven many south african hams are gearing up to increase the distance over the coming southern summer
6165300 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive
6165301 however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
6165302 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
6165303 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatments this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives
6165304 lessons in the alexander technique offer an individualised approach to develop skills that help people recognise understand and avoid poor habits affecting postural tone and neuromuscular coordination
6165305 it can potentially reduce back pain by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving coordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
6165306 there is little evidence available about the effectiveness of the alexander technique so this research is welcome
6165307 the alexander technique is something we do recommend and the feedback we have got is good

6165310 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6165311 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
6165312 this is just the tip of the iceberg im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
6165313 the effect on grapefruit juice on some medicines is well established and where this applies it is clearly detailed in patient information leaflets
6165314 pharmacists will usually draw this matter to patients attention when dispensing their medicines this new research showing that apple and orange juice may enhance or reduce the effects of some medicines is interesting but it is only one study
6165315 usually further research is needed to establish that these interactions are significant

6165397 must you always begin every sentence with to put it in a nutshell
6165398 these are not the best of times for literary work
6165399 the topic is one that is both terrifying and stale for me
6165400 wordsmithing edgardo vega yunqu a puerto rican born novelist began going to librera a lectorum one of the oldest spanish language bookstores in new york in the early 1960s as a student at new york university
6165401 librera a lectorum was more important as a presence rather than a resource said mr vega who lives in brooklyn lectorum is more like a cultural icon like a statue that reminds us of who we are unfortunately that cultural landmark needed to sell books to stay afloat with new rent increases lectorum could not run the bookstore in a profitable way
6165402 it is both accurate and chilling that a bookstore gone broke because of greedy land lords and absentee customers is indeed a cultural icon that reminds us of who we are
6165403 the bookstore that is no longer a bookstore the customer who stopped being a customer those absences are holes in the fabric of what we might believe we are cigarette burns in cheap rayon voids in a cultural landscape that cannot be mended
6165404 so i will leave you to fill in the storys lacunae and point out that you and your hard dollars might off set the flaccidity of edgardo vega sentiment we begin with a lesson in literary
6165405 contemporary publishing with perhaps the exception of university and literary presses is ruled by the marketing department
6165406 we can choose to know edgardo vegas sentiments as the butt smoke they are that which he blows up his own vacuity and we can actively support flagstaffs few remaining independent bookstores i am most familiar with aradia at 116 w cottage located deliciously near macys and the beaver st brewery and starrlight on leroux street both stores are aladdins chests filled with treasure and if by some miracle the book you want isnt there they will order you will be a presence you will know who you are
6165407 this story is so improbable it could be a bad fairy tale
6165408 the bookstore owner appealed the rent increases after all the landlord and lady had never repaired any of the attrition that developed in the little aging bookstore
6165409 the story teller grinned her smile that of a poisonous snake
6165410 though this is a fairy tale the call was never made the bookstore will be put to rest on april 1 and the words of the landlord in the alarming newspaper article will go down in local history as the most fatuous defense for greed every spoken you know theres a point at which compassion becomes codependency

6165455 son falsas de principio a fin el pp no hace m s que inventar cifras y llegar a conclusiones que nada tienen que ver con la realidad que vivimos los valencianos
6165456 la realidad es que camps es el presidente de la comunitat aut noma donde m s crece el paro un 39 en el ltimo a o siete puntos m s que la media nacional camps ha logrado que castell n pase del pleno empleo a que sea la provincia l der absoluta en generar desempleo con un 78 de incremento
6165457 es imposible afirmar que se han creado 235 000 empleos acumulados por los grandes eventos porque la realidad es otra bien distinta ya que camps es responsable directo de 70 000 parados m s en un a o por su falta de inversiones y pol ticas en la industria el comercio turismo o agricultura
6165458 es otro de los inventos de camps la realidad es que las inversiones de la generalitat brillan por su ausencia este a o han recortado en un 48 las inversiones en obra p blica mientras en los dos a os anteriores se dej de ejecutar obras por un 20 del importe previsto
6165459 camps ha situado a la comunitat en la bancarrota con m s de 20 000 millones de pagos comprometidos y una deuda transferida a las futuros presidentes de la generalitat que supera los 13 000 millones de euros
6165460 camps sabe que el nico que invierte y que saca las casta as del fuego a los valencianos es zapatero ya que si fuera por el no tendr amos ni agua ni copa am rica ni ave ni aeropuertos ni nada que signifique progreso para los valencianos
6165461 camps ofrece el peor balance de una legislatura en 30 a os de democracia siendo el presidente que m s paro endeudamiento y morosidad genera
6165462 camps se ha demostrado as mismo su incapacidad para afrontar los problemas y aportar soluciones mientras trata de mentir constantemente a trav s de los medios oficiales y afines lo que demuestra su incapacidad para gobernar
6165463 aun estamos esperando que nos diga donde ha construido las 100 000 viviendas protegidas que anuncio la pasada legislatura o los 1 200 millones en instalaciones deportivas que iba a invertir para la copa am rica cuando no ha sido capaz ni de acabar en tiempo y forma el gora donde se iba a entregar el trofeo ahora hace un a o

6165492 he was right underneath us and i thought holy cow how are we going to kill it
6165493 from the launch of annahataks first grenade tipped harpoon the hunters killed the whale with shotguns and traditional weapons in 30 minutes
6165494 it was a very rapid hunt so it is very unlikely that the animal actually suffered
6165495 i cant think of anything that defines helplessness and fear more than a seal pup on the ice that cant swim or escape as it is approached by some cigarette smoking ape with a club
6165496 its how we live and its how we feed our families
6165497 i could crawl up and cry like a baby but im trying to be strong
6165498 i kicked and i kicked but still i would not get any points
6165499 i know my hits and i know my shots and these should have been points
6165500 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6165501 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice
6165502 as they live their lives they really do not become very involved with government
6165503 one family doesnt go there is a group of them that goes like two or three or four
6165504 they can continue to let people know were here come visit us how the land is the orchards do great or whatever
6165505 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6165506 in court records and whose friends say she doesnt want to talk about the experience gay pride t shirts and rainbow colored clothing when they found out how davis had treated her and he questioned many of them about their sexuality and association with gay students some were suspended
6165507 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6165508 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words
6165509 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6165510 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6165511 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6165512 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6165513 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6165514 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6165515 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota
6165516 i looked the man in the eye i found him to be very straight forward and trustworthy and we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul
6165517 he may not have been in the cone of silence
6165518 no funds no phone no cigarettes no shoes no transportation also it appeared that she was suffering from a severe lack of common sense moral fiber and sheer gumption

6165530 jane i think you need to come and see this
6165531 it was the only instance in my roman catholic life that ive considered suicide
6165532 we saw the flashing lights and all the people the cop cars and the paddy wagon
6165533 i wanted to stay clear of it to get away as fast as i can
6165534 theyd fired tear gas because the crowd was throwing things like rocks and bags of feces
6165535 suddenly this great cloud of gas rolled over the car
6165536 i saw cars pulled over to the side there was one cadillac with an elderly couple getting rid of their evening meal
6165537 that was the spooky part seeing people you know getting pushed around
6165538 i never met a policeman who went out of the way to harm someone
6165539 from my perspective if the crowd had listened to orders and obeyed the law there would have been no confrontation the crowd was not an orderly crowd
6165540 it was a matter of male ego in my opinion
6165541 if daley had not elected to clear out the parks at 11 p m you wouldnt have had a street fight at the convention
6165542 i told him senator i just came here to be appointed not ordained
6165543 they voted me the only guy they trusted over 30
6165544 the war being fought now doesnt have a draft associated with it
6165545 its the draft that made all the difference these people had friends in vietnam
6165546 it was a close to a nervous breakdown those kids were distraught
6165547 the people at the rally felt very strongly about what the war was doing to the people of vietnam but also to the people of this country
6165548 the police formed a v wedge through the middle of the crowd no one had any idea they were coming through they were just listening to the speakers
6165549 i think i was shocked the city and state would go to such extremes to stop what was for the most part a peaceful organization
6165550 at the end of the day i felt very demoralized
6165551 and felt change was much further off than i expected i think there were more tears in my eyes because of what i saw than what the mace caused

6165554 over the past seven years it has been my great honor and privilege to serve as chancellor of the university of wisconsin madison an institution that so many inspired and talented scholars and leaders have helped build since 1848
6165555 although my academic background as a student researcher professor and administrator for the last 30 years is firmly rooted in science i cant imagine a world without the visual and performing arts a great university provides superb arts programs for talented and aspiring students

6165557 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6165558 if we turn to our military policy there also we differ from our antagonists
6165559 most of my predecessors in this place have commended him who made this speech part of the law telling us that it is well that it should be delivered at the burial of those who fall in battle
6165560 i shall begin with our ancestors it is both just and proper that they should have the honour of the first mention on an occasion like the present
6165561 our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves
6165562 further we provide plenty of means for the mind to refresh itself from business
6165563 if we turn to our military policy there also we differ from our antagonists
6165564 nor are these the only points in which our city is worthy of admiration
6165565 in short i say that as a city we are the school of hellas while i doubt if the world can produce a man who where he has only himself to depend upon is equal to so many emergencies and graced by so happy a versatility as the athenian
6165566 indeed if i have dwelt at some length upon the character of our country it has been to show that our stake in the struggle is not the same as theirs who have no such blessings to lose and also that the panegyric of the men over whom i am now speaking might be by definite proofs established

6165601 we have already achieved the millennium development goals for halving water and sanitation and we are well ahead of our target to achieve universal access by 2014
6165602 i know that you know about the beauty of our country and our biodiversity but you also know that madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world
6165603 which equates to a total coverage of 88 percent and 74 percent of the population respectively
6165604 south africa is extremely well placed to host the next event after turkey in 2009 as this would bring the focus and all the activities of awareness to africa and in particular to the southern hemisphere
6165605 if you are to transform a nation you must attend to some basic things first and that is why water and sanitation are so important
6165606 madagascar is fully aware of how important water sanitation and hygiene are to health community development and even to the economic development of the nation
6165607 more than the number dying from malaria measles and aids combined
6165608 do you think children in america or sweden die because of diarrhoea or bad drinking water no it doesnt happen in the 21st century why should it happen in africa
6165609 we are not talking about something as complex as building a rocket to take people to the moon we are talking about teaching children to wash their hands with soap to use proper sanitation techniques and about improving access to clear water for villages
6165610 and we are not talking about designing the latest computer we are talking about helping people to drill wells and use water pumps and collect rainwater on their roofs
6165611 all it requires are common sense strategies a little creativity and the wisdom to use proven and effective strategies used in many countries around the world
6165612 im going to the republican convention not to attack the democratic candidate but to explain to the american people why i support john mccain
6165613 senator mccain asked me to do it and i strongly support him

6165624 when we became aware that there was a naming process
6165625 it became apparent that this would be a wonderful opportunity to honor westmoreland daviss many contributions to state and local education
6165626 people expect to be checked when they enter the country and for the government to determine if theyre admissible or not
6165627 what they dont expect is for the government to keep a record for 15 years of their comings into the country
6165628 history has shown whether you are talking about criminal or terrorist activity that plotting planning or even relationships among conspirators can go on for years
6165629 basic travel records can quite literally help frontline officers to connect the dots
6165630 these sites provide a record for the future about the workings of the government in this day and time
6165631 most government information today is published on the web and not published in paper
6165632 in the past 10 years there has been a radical change in the way that information is published by the government to its constituents
6165633 the majority of information is actually made available through these web sites but they are changing very rapidly as new information is introduced and especially as administration changes occur
6165634 when bush took over the second that he was sworn in the white house web site went from being this massive collection of important links to a picture of bush and his biography and a picture of vice president cheney and his biography
6165635 we dont want to see that happen again its just very important for historys sake that this material is archived the way that the printed material has always been archived
6165636 we are deeply disappointed by the verdict and we believe there are substantial grounds for an appeal which we intend to pursue vigorously
6165637 the government has basically never publicly reviewed whether the conflict of interests rules work they dont
6165638 its one of these cases that does go right to the heart of the procurement process
6165639 we maintain that our work for the nrc was free of even the potential for a conflict of interest
6165640 our work for other customers was entirely independent of the possible nrc standards at issue in the case as it was performed in support of the department of energy a federal department that is autonomous self regulating and separate from the nrc
6165641 radiological assessments of clearance of equipment and materials from nuclear facilities
6165642 detailed and broad based technical assistance on the subject matter of the release and reuse recycle of material and equipment from nuclear facilities
6165643 saic was looking at ways of taking advantage of these opportunities
6165644 saic was interested in pursuing the billions of dollars worth of business that would result from doe and other commercial nuclear facilities performing decontamination and decommissioning of their facilities
6165645 saic did not disclose this as an organizational conflict of interest relationship
6165646 if saic has an oci relationship to disclose it is not enough to simply bury it in the text of a technical proposal if there is an oci relationship it is not nrcs obligation to find it
6165647 its really affected the tone and tenor of the site
6165648 i went into the air and landed on my back
6165649 she said gee im really sorry but i have to issue you a citation

6165686 we are not going to melt down the medals its not my decision at the end of the day its the riders decision but theres not any point in doing that i dont think
6165687 in the past i know the australians and the english have done the same thing theyve approached and theyve been presented with a fifth medal as well
6165688 we have got such a strong team now thats just the nature of having all these great riders in such a competitive environment
6165689 there is still a chance that we could win the tri nations and we want to go out there and play positive rugby

6165695 all the countries have been invited after each match to put a report forward on every referee where they have got concerns
6165696 countries like england wales argentina and many others have all spent time after games submitting very mature reports that is very valuable to us
6165697 however i have yet to hear from the south africans all season there is a medium to go through and that is me but i have no sympathy for a coach that wants to go through the media rather than me

6165711 dr garland has many years of experience as a faculty member both as a dedicated teacher and a respected scholar
6165712 these faculty credentials combined with his experience as an academic administrator make him an excellent choice for this appointment
6165713 i have every confidence david garland will do an excellent job as interim president
6165714 at one level he embodies the very best of baylors tradition of the scholar teacher at another level david understands fully baylors unique challenge to be the top protestant research university in the country i know those who care about baylor will rally to his support
6165715 it is encouraging that we have such a fine person in david garland to serve in this role said jeff kilgore executive vice president and ceo of the baylor alumni association

6165736 the supreme court came up with a verdict asking the government to take action to protect the rights of the kumari
6165737 the court ruled there were no historic or religious documents that state the child should be denied the rights of education movement etc she should not be denied these things just because she is the kumari
6165738 this is not good news in any case she is a goddess so how can court rulings apply
6165739 her teacher comes to the kumari palace every day and she has three hours a day when she can meet people
6165740 we will ask the goddess if she wants to go outside more and if she wants she can go but i dont think she feels comfortable leaving the palace

6165757 while stocks in the equipment and services group tend to move with oil prices in the near term their profits depend more on exploration spending than on commodity prices
6165758 concerns about slowing demand for crude oil and re ned products both in the u s and overseas have many investors worried but investors in the equipment and services group should not panic
6165759 most producers continue to spend aggressively and u s crude oil inventories remain well below the average for this time of year with fewer than 20 days of supply in storage
6165760 demand for offshore drilling services remains strong giving transocean excellent growth potential consensus estimates project per share profits will rise 69 in 2008 and 15 in 2009 transocean the worlds largest offshore drilling contractor operates in every major drilling region
6165761 a combination of tight global rig supplies and the ongoing discovery of new offshore reserves have driven rig lease rates higher and kept transoceans fleet busy the companys largest most expensive rigs are 95 sold out for 2009 and the backlog is growing
6165762 oceaneering international has fallen 28 since the end of june reflecting a drop in petroleum prices and somewhat disappointing guidance for the second half of 2008 the pullback represents a buying opportunity as the stock seems cheap considering oceaneerings pro t outlook
6165763 oceaneering makes its money by selling equipment and providing services to drillers a business that should remain lucrative as long as drilling demand remains strong exploration activity is likely to remain robust even if per barrel oil prices fall to the 80 to 100 range
6165764 given the large number of offshore wells now being drilled 300 plus in 2008 with even more to come demand for oceaneerings products should pick up
6165765 in addition todays deeper wells will require longer umbilicals the tubes used to pump oil robust demand for remotely operated vehicles is driving rental rates up oceaneerings 214 vessels represent the worlds largest feelt of remote vehicles
6165766 company guidance looks conservative and we expect oceaneering to exceed wall street expectations over the next year in the wake of the recent sell off the shares trade at a modest 14 times estimated year ahead earnings
6165767 since oceaneerings profits and cash flows are not directly affected by changes in oil prices we expect the shares to recover rising substantially over the next year on the strength of robust operating results

6165777 our relationship that we just announced is exclusively with the corporate credit card side of the business
6165778 cliqbook even though we havent had a formal relationship with them
6165779 principally from american express travels perspective its all about channeling that travel dollar and pushing it to the card from their perspective its advantageous to work with any number of travel providers and get that pull through onto the corporate travel card theres plenty of opportunity to work together in the future in the end its the customer who always makes the choice from amexs perspective if the customer wants to choose concur cliqbook they certainly can to the extent that the customer wants an integrated travel and expense offering theres nothing that precludes us in the amex relationship from offering travel and expense solutions into that relationship
6165780 what i would go back to is the customer will decide
6165781 the ability for us to do anything different with amex on the travel side is down the road and will be predicated on what we do with the relationship we have on the credit card side

6165792 mccain continues to lead obama by about 10 percentage points but with an unusually high 28 percent of the voters still undecided mccain maintains his lead in arizona mainly because evangelicals and conservative democrats are disproportionately supporting him the mccain campaign also appears to have successfully created a fairly strong anti obama sentiment in the state it will be interesting to see if the obama campaign chooses to campaign heavily in arizona voter turnout also will be an important factor in the final outcome of this contest polls are not very good at determining who will and will not vote a higher turnout will probably help obama more than mccain another factor will be whether the latino vote in arizona turns out in significant numbers

6165812 my decision was nothing about the coaching staff or playing time i just had certain things in my life i needed to take care of and they involved me leaving
6165813 i try to put my lineups together where he can stay in the ballgame and not have to face an abundance of left hand relievers
6165814 when hes hitting seventh or wherever hes hitting its because im trying to keep him in the ballgame and get him right handed pitching
6165815 i was fortunate enough that back home i had a little field for my league and i always played baseball
6165816 so i just want to give an opportunity to the kids to see us and get motivated theyre getting a new field so they can take advantage of all the opportunities given to them to be successful

6165819 hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6165820 he said it wouldnt work he announced his policy toward iraq the day before he left for the first time in over 900 days to visit iraq and then he refuses to acknowledge the surge has succeeded remarkable remarkable
6165821 no rational observer can go to iraq and see what we are doing for the last years and say the surge hasnt succeeded
6165822 are you going to pick a vice president that conservatives can rally around in the future or are you going to give us someone that is going to make us want to stay home
6165823 i would not consider frosted flakes the food of an olympian
6165824 i would rather see him promoting fiber one i would rather see him promoting oatmeal i would even rather see him promoting cheerios
6165825 as an official sponsor of the 2008 u s olympic team and a proud sponsor of phelps it is only fitting that kellogg company feature this world class athlete on its iconic boxes of kelloggs corn flakes and kelloggs frosted flakes cereals
6165826 michael embodies the values behind our frosted flakes earn your stripes tm 87 59 1 33 1 49 program he knows that winning is not just about the glory that comes with gold medals but about good sportsmanship working hard and being your best
6165827 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6165828 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6165829 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6165830 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6165831 no one can dictate to poland what it should do thats in the past
6165832 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated

6165843 the agency and insurers agreed to put 4 5 million into a settlement fund against which eligible writers would be able to make claims without admitting any wrongdoing the agency also agreed to establish an independent task force to examine its representation practices

6165846 the government knows this is nonsense we work around the world and stay out of politics
6165847 we are desperate to get working but until the world food programme signs an agreement with the government we cant
6165848 even some top zanu pf politicians are encouraging us to break the ban as there is pressure from traditional leaders for food aid
6165849 if the ban is lifted it will take us another month to set up food in warehouses in south africa may be sent to other countries or else it will become stale
6165850 honestly i dont know and we know the situation is bad
6165851 what is really happening i cant even buy a meal for my grandchildren every time i look at them my heart bleeds and i cry
6165852 we dont even light a fire at night because there is nothing to cook
6165853 these politicians are liars the last time they came here they promised us food and up to now nothing has come
6165854 we hope britain and america will send us food tomorrow
6165855 an indication beyond reasonable doubt of unwillingness to continue to be part of the talks
6165856 firmly committed to this dialogue for one reason and one reason alone the suffering of zimbabweans has to come to an end and any opportunity of liberating them from the current madness has to be pursued to its logical conclusion
6165857 the u s was not involved in that raid it was an element of one of the iraqi special operations forces do we support it in principle absolutely not
6165858 it was what appears to be a rogue operation its definitely concerning that we have an element that would go do something like that
6165859 our convention will showcase a cross section of leaders who will highlight john mccains long commitment to putting our country first before self interest or politics
6165860 the speakers will address john mccains unmatched record of service and sacrifice for america and his vision for moving our nation forward to keep us safe and get our economy back on track
6165861 how do you reconcile that citi is the largest funder of coal plants around the world

6165871 the firms we cover lehman in particular continue to have significant exposures to the troubled asset classes with the exception of leveraged loans these exposures have proven difficult to remove or to hedge effectively as the market for these positions remains relatively illiquid as a result as long as these firms have these troubled assets on their balance sheets their earnings results will be affected by the fluctuations in the fixed income market
6165872 the problem we have with lehman is that we really dont know whats been happening with their balance sheet they said that they were done with deleveraging but we just dont know everyone has exposure to problematic fixed income securities but lehman is the most exposed we are expecting write downs for this quarter probably around 3 billion they have a very good asset management business but the real problem for them is getting rid of some of their bad assets which is a challenge especially in this environment
6165873 so darlin if youre wonderin why ive got you here tonight i wanna be your husband i want you to be my wife i aint got much to give you but what ive got means everything its my last name oh its my last name

6165890 a university of virginia medical researcher from the middle east has been placed on leave without pay after the federal government denied his green card application and revoked his work authorization
6165891 nationality or religion those are the only reasons why i can think its been denied its logic either you give me a reason or thats the only reason
6165892 i think he is a very good scientist and hes a value to the department
6165893 we dont under any circumstances consider race ethnicity religion gender or any of that

6165895 smudges on disk dirty optics mis configured dvdr drive etc etc
6165896 much more needs to be done to create the access necessary for the oil industry to do what it does best and develop this countrys resources to secure our energy security
6165897 this is where we have found success and we are the clear leader
6165898 we came here to win and we are leaving winners
6165899 companies are recognizing a movement afoot but im not sure this sale says much about that
6165900 no one is the same you cant compare yourself to other people because everyone is different
6165901 race is the most explosive issue in american life precisely because it forces us to confront the tragic facts of poverty and paranoia despair and distrust

6165907 the university of virginia has banned all signs at its athletics events a move that some are construing as an infringement of cavalier sports fans freedom of expression
6165908 beginning this year signs are not permitted inside athletics facilities
6165909 derogatory comments profanity impede another guests view of the field or cover any stadium signage
6165910 all banners signs and flags are prohibited in scott stadium
6165911 as for relating this to last year i think it may
6165912 i sincerely regret the confusion over last years incident if it did in fact play a role in this decision
6165913 while its disappointing to see all signs banned i suspect the move was made to avoid any misinterpretation regarding the sign policy
6165914 im not sure it infringes on our freedom of speech as the athletic department has the power to regulate what is allowed to enter the athletic venues
6165915 the policy change is intended to support and promote sportsmanship in a positive game day environment for all fans in attendance
6165916 somebodys expecting us to have a pretty bad year i guess
6165917 the key factor in determining the constitutionality of a restriction on speech in a public place is whether it is directed at what is being said
6165918 in other words does the restriction apply to all speech and not just the speech you dont like
6165919 she remains in critical condition at present in our intensive care unit our thoughts and prayers are with her family at this very difficult time

6165921 the best values from trusted sellers become better and better
6165922 i have no control i have to comply with anything they choose to do and i have no voice in the matter
6165923 id be giving up a months income to get that done thats the only thing thats keeping me on ebay the inconvenience of leaving
6165924 i talk to other people who have done what i did and theyre happy with their decision theyve been able to get their business to the ebay business levels or beyond
6165925 many times you feel like theyre really pushing it to see if youll give them some kind of a refund
6165926 theyll float the suggestion that this isnt exactly what i expected
6165927 when ebay makes these dramatic changes it can make you very nervous
6165928 but again ebay is doing what ebay believes it has to do to protect its marketplace
6165929 evidence basedclinical practice guidelines strongly recommend that elderly traumapatients be treated as aggressively as non elderly patients however some studies have suggested that age bias may still exist in traumacare even in the prehospital phase of that care
6165930 the problem of age bias raised in this study maynegate efforts to improve clinical care for elderly trauma patientswithin trauma centers if the system as a whole does not functionproperly and deliver patients appropriately to needed resources
6165931 however it may be difficult to change attitudes of age bias and mayrequire a broad societal campaign
6165932 additionally it may be helpful to highlight theliterature that now suggests that elderly trauma patients do in fact return to productive lives after their injury which can eliminate theperception of futility of care that may be used consciously orsubconsciously to justify age bias
6165933 weve been running ever since we came here many years ago
6165934 now the whole world wanna know how we running so they say there must be something in the air down there in jamaica that make jamaicans run like the wind
6165935 quarrie winning gold in the 200 in the 1976 olympics and silver in the 100 was a catapult for a lot of kids who thought if i work hard i can be like don quarrie
6165936 now youre going to have more kids being spurred on to be the next usain bolt
6165937 a true friend never gets in your way unless you happen to be going down
6165938 as the world flips over from a predominantly rural to a predominantly urban population base cities are going to take more and more water for agriculture
6165939 however most of the water going into urban areas comes out the other end in the sewers
6165940 we know that there is an informal sector within many cities that is using wastewater to grow vegetables but there has been no data on how much of this water was being used or what the risks were
6165941 its a crisis of leadership a crisis of strategy and a crisis of what the future looks like for the supermajors
6165942 they are like a deer caught in headlights they know they have to move but they cant decide where to go
6165943 international companies have a portfolio of assets in areas of significant decline and no frontier discoveries to make up for that
6165944 there is still a lot of oil to develop out there which is why we dont call this geological peak oil especially in places like venezuela russia iran and iraq
6165945 is a departure from the traditional approach we have taken
6165946 will likely face a variety of practical problems as well as two significant legal issues 1 whether we have jurisdiction over this aspect of the practice of pharmacy and 2 whether we can regulate intrastate sales of unapproved new drugs
6165947 may prompt an outcry from the general community of pharmacists and physicians

6165950 there was no hesitation on the part of foreign experts to say whats needed is to improve the rule of law including independence of the judiciary there was a little bit of push back from the syrians but there was a debate among the syrians
6165951 none of us thought we were being used or abused
6165952 not only to raise awareness on legal issues but also to assist members of the legal profession in syria in the development of contacts and links with lawyers in other parts of the world
6165953 senator obama values the expertise of ambassador kurtzer but he is not a paid adviser nor is he authorized to conduct talks with any government ambassador kurtzers trip was part of an aba delegation on legal reform and had no connection with the campaign
6165954 the british syrian society is closely connected to the family
6165955 official unofficial syrian intellectuals to come to washington and lobby on behalf of the regime
6165956 but its not a secret that the syrians are openly banking on barack obama its not surprising that they would build bridges in advance and do this through the window of the peace process
6165957 if one of senator obamas advisers has been to damascus we just wonder how many have been to tehran
6165958 thats ridiculous of course no advisers have been to tehran
6165959 so where do all our tax dollars for education go
6165960 how do they print off any materials they might need
6165961 how do they get to the library if their parents are working
6165962 what if the library is open but all the computers are occupied
6165963 were trying to not wait and do that whole thing
6165964 were trying to get on it weve identified the hernia as the problem and were trying to get it taken care of
6165965 when i got here this morning one of the guys said you cant start today
6165966 i told my coaches that were not going to rush it
6165967 if i get to the first game i have only four plays i can run thats ok maybe ill have five plays its ok were going to be very vanilla were starting from zero and are going to be slow and methodical who we are at the beginning of the season wont be who we are at the end
6165968 when we have a stud player a great running back he wears no 2 or 5
6165969 right now nobody is going to wear those numbers not yet at least if theres somebody deserving theyll wear it that player might be here already but i havent identified him yet

6165980 es inapropiado hablar del acta porque desde el congreso establecemos una instancia superior a cualquier resoluci n
6165981 la ley es simple se compran las acciones un tribunal tasa y en una segunda vuelta nosotros aprobamos o no ese monto
6165982 pedir una quiebra es algo que queda bonito para salir en televisi n pero es impracticable para la continuidad del servicio
6165983 rescatar el papel del estado y que no asuma la deuda de la empresa
6165984 la certeza que el pueblo argentino se hace cargo de la deuda que contrajo una empresa privada
6165985 no es suficiente con omitir el acta sino que hay que rechazarla y pedirle al poder ejecutivo que vuelva a negociar con marsans
6165986 tasaci n sea al momento de la asistencia del poder ejecutivo
6165987 las modificaciones que se le realizaron al proyecto del ejecutivo tienen que ver con el rol de esta oposici n
6165988 se declaran la utilidad p blica y en consecuencia se expropian

6165990 i think there has been a great deal of healing

6165994 if i was the neighbor right next to that id want as much barrier as i could have
6165995 the battleground is always in the middle its not the party regulars on the left or the right but smack dab in the center
6165996 yes rudy will help with the independents but hell also rally the troops by his ability to get the convention rocking and rolling
6165997 there was nobody more conservative in the republican race than rudy giuliani on taxes
6165998 by executing these inevitable changes now we secured more players as part of our focus towards building a deeper stronger inventory of young talent

6166004 i can take you all the way back to when the reds traded frank robinson to baltimore for milt pappas
6166005 while the run production generated by these two veterans will not be quickly replaced we chose to endure the short term ramifications for the sake of building a strong competitive team for 2009 and many seasons to come
6166006 the vast majority of our 50 draft picks were signed culminating last week with first rounder yonder alonso and a pair of talented pitchers our expanded scouting operations also signed juan duran from the dominican republic and yorman rodriguez from venezuela who are arguably the best amateur free agent position players from their respective countries

6166016 oh come now ace all lady peinforte knew was what the nemesis statue told her what could that millennia old hunk of over articulated scrap metal have to say about me
6166017 when i was very young not more than a hundred or so you know i made something of a hobby of researching ancient gallifrey technology the accepted theory at the time held that the living metal was mere propaganda not least because there was a whacking great chunk of validium in the academys museum and it had never so much as twitched
6166018 exactly once id figured that out i convinced the high councils archivist to lend me the only other known sample and i stuck the two bits together
6166019 old borusa nominated me for a special commendation on the project

6166084 year after year we see the appearance of several malware strains that use valentines day as bait to attract users
6166085 this indicates that cyber crooks are still reaping the benefits of this technique and many people still fall into the trap
6166086 both cases are clear examples of social engineering techniques used to spread malware they use attractive subjects valentines day greeting cards romantic desktop themes etc to entice users to run attachments or click links that ultimately download malware onto their computers

6166101 little bratty kid who pestered the teenagers in the hood you see he was 10 years older than me
6166102 red lobster for dinner journey and who knows what else is in store for the evening
6166103 he didnt even notice when i stopped coloring my hair
6166104 aaron didnt do anything wrong he did what i did he used the guard to go to ou
6166105 christian strong duty values heart country proud blah blah blah
6166106 and there are too many air national guardsmen that have served for him to do that he is not one of them
6166107 right after sept 11 things settled down and deployments were starting to come down
6166108 we had received a requirement to send a team to kuwait and all of a sudden aaron submits a conscientious objector packet i believe it was a subterfuge to keep from going to the desert cause he was on the list
6166109 i also did everything i was asked to do and went everywhere i was asked to go i sought the co status mainly because of my christian principles
6166110 and i had serious questions about whether or not i could take someones life
6166111 youre not deployed while the request is being acted on
6166112 so until its either approved or disapproved the co application he was saying he cant pick up a weapon to defend this country he sat in an administrative role at will rogers while other people filled in for him and went to the desert
6166113 honestly it never really entered my mind when i signed up for the service that i might have to take another persons life thats why it was such a tough decision i did it to protect the guys i was with
6166114 i did a brief investigation found out what he was doing and submitted the information to the judge advocate general jag
6166115 when youre in a certain status you have to pay for your meals
6166116 but he was going over and eating and not paying for his meals which constitutes fraud
6166117 it was over one meal and he placed me in cuffs and said he was charging me with fraud people were shocked they were completely surprised
6166118 he was involuntarily mobilized and deployed stateside under operation noble eagle which was only stateside i was deployed with him at this time while deployed he did everything he could think of to get home after he found that there was a chance we could be forward deployed overseas
6166119 he was required to pay for meals he ate at the base dining facility
6166120 he was investigated and it was found that even after being told this he still ate there without paying for those meals
6166121 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
6166122 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
6166123 well you guys did it so we get to do it
6166124 yeah just look around you 99 percent of the people here are total hipsters
6166125 these hipster zombies are the idols of the style pages the darlings of viral marketers and the marks of predatory real estate agents
6166126 and they must be buried for cool to be reborn

6166128 no its just well if you dont know why then you just shouldnt even use it
6166129 ok so what are you girls doing tonight after this party

6166179 the case information we have been given also shows that there are different methods of trafficking and different routes into scotland
6166180 amnesty is concerned that victims of trafficking in scotland are not being properly identified and without acceptance of their status they cannot access appropriate services or help police with their enquiries
6166181 this is why amnesty recommends a multi agency approach to identification and the care and treatment of trafficked persons scotland is in a particularly good position to apply this approach and the scottish government has an opportunity before the ratification of the european convention against trafficking to take a lead on implementing the convention to the highest standard
6166182 war crimes or crimes against humanity committed on the territory of georgia regardless of nationality of the perpetrator would fall within the jurisdiction of the international criminal court under article 12 of the rome statute of the international criminal court
6166183 georgia ratified the rome statute on 5 september 2003 russia signed the rome statute on 13 september 2000 while it has not yet ratified it it is bound not to defeat its object and purpose by committing war crimes or crimes against humanity
6166184 journalists as all other civilians in the conflict zone must be protected from hostilities
6166185 human rights monitors including from intergovernmental human rights bodies should be allowed full access to the conflict zone
6166186 moreover prior to the ceasefire there had been reports that humanitarian aid had been prevented from getting through to civilians trapped in the conflict zone
6166187 for example russian media reported that russian aid could not get through to tskhinvali on 11 august due to ongoing hostilities on 12 august the international committee of the red cross icrc stated that its access to south ossetia to deliver aid was being hampered by the intense fighting

6166189 sudans anti terrorism special courts are nothing but a travesty of justice
6166190 some of the people sentenced only met their lawyers for the first time during the trial while several said they suffered torture when they were held incommunicado and that they were forced to confess to crimes
6166191 those trials were clearly unfair and now sudan is preparing to try yet more people with this system how is that justice
6166192 the sudanese government has the duty to investigate crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice but they must do it in accordance with international law and the sudanese constitution which guarantees fair trials
6166193 we urge the sudanese authorities not to execute these men and to review their cases immediately

6166204 they told me at the blood bank this might happen
6166205 this is just a 15 minute power nap as described in that time management course you sent me
6166206 whew guess i left the top off the white out you probably got here just in time
6166207 i wasnt sleeping i was meditating on the mission statement and envisioning a new paradigm
6166208 i was doing yoga exercises to relieve work related stress

6166211 i thought blogging would be the same as when i used to have messenger i only had 3 or 4 people who could get on it and i thought youd be able to do the same with blogging i guess anyone can get on because ive heard from more than one person they thought i should know it seems terrible that you went through that on saturday morning and your family didnt know
6166212 like me or dont like me and if you dont like me then pardon me but buzz off
6166213 i chase three children to stay in shape i dont have a regular routine when i notice things arent quite where i want them to be i step it up you park farther from the door you take the stairs instead of the elevator
6166214 if people are finding inspiration ok but the book is for my kids
6166215 under the ruse of giving an academic lecture i was trying to put myself in a bottle that would one day wash up on the beach for my children
6166216 id like to thank the millions of people who have offered their love prayers and support randy was so happy and proud that the lecture and book inspired parents to revisit their priorities particularly their relationships with their children the outpouring of cards and emails really sustained him
6166217 your love of family dedication in the classroom and passion for teaching will stand as a lasting legacy and i am grateful for your willingness to serve
6166218 good teaching is always a performance but what randy did was in a class all by itself
6166219 his students responded to him as athletes do to a great coach who cares not only about winning but about the team players as individuals
6166220 we interview every owner of every structure that goes on fire

6166222 we thought you were the best act on tonight we loved it
6166223 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6166224 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is one of four models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6166225 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6166226 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option

6166232 so last night my friend paige dragged me to see billy bob thornton and his band
6166233 wow she could go to that but not her husbands movie premiere thats love
6166234 i bet if it was her movie he would be there
6166235 i wouldnt be suprised if he did cheat on her since she leaves him alone alot of the time
6166236 theyve probably split already and trying to keep it low for the kids sake there were rumors that he cheated with his tennis instructor
6166237 in the recent interviews whenever they asked about her he went all weird avoiding eye contact and being lost for words when usually his conversation is flowing
6166238 i really think david loves his wife i just dont think she loves him anymore i think he wants to work things out
6166239 word in toronto circles among the crew and extras is that dd cheats on tea regularly tennis instructor isnt the first word at la costa is that tea found out about his affair with his tennis partner it was common knowledge at lc as they were there together all the time tea rarely if ever frequented the club he used it just for t and he wasnt exactly discreet he was there nearly daily and now hasnt been in a while
6166240 i just dont understand teas actions i would want to support my man the craziness of premieres cant be easy probably just nice to have someone there with you
6166241 teas moms family is from texas my guess about her attending this concert is that she and the kids were visiting relatives in the area at the time and she figured itd be nice to show her co star a bit of support while she was in town
6166242 tea lioni and billy bob thorton are secretly dating she is traveling with him while he is on tour with his band she wears a wig some times they are making a movie together so im sure that will be used as some type of cover up
6166243 i swear some people are total morons so because t a goes to a concert instead of dds premiere theyre have problems geez if every time my brother and his wife dont go somewhere together would mean they have problem they had problems all the time its not up to you guys to decide why or why not they do what they do dd was probably out for days t a just one night she probably took care of the kids for the rest of the time you all should be ashamed of yourself go buy a barbie or something you seem to be that age
6166244 calling someone a moron just because they have a difference of opinion is not cool you are speculating just like everyone else no one but david amp and tea know if they are separated or not and if they are separated who cares people do get separated this is hollywood whether is david thats cheating or tea whether they are both faithful it doesnt matter no one including you linda should not be speculating on anything everyone is just stating their opinions this is afterall a free country they can do anything they please gosh you sound more like a moron than anon
6166245 ive been with my husband longer than they have been together and im their age and i still think its odd that tea didnt go to any of the premieres she doesnt have to go to everything she obviously doesnt but this one was a big deal
6166246 our main concern is to protect our citizens and the businesses in our community so they can go home safe at night and enjoy the merits of their activities
6166247 this is the first time that a study provides evidence that in the human brain dopamine is involved in the adaptations that result from sleep deprivation
6166248 these findings suggest dopamine may increase after sleep deprivation as a compensatory response to the effects of increased sleep drive in the brain
6166249 the extent to which this occurs may differentiate how vulnerable people are to the neurobehavioral effects of sleep loss
6166250 however the concurrent decline in cognitive performance which is associated with the dopamine increases suggests that the adaptation is not sufficient to overcome the cognitive deterioration induced by sleep deprivation and may even contribute to it

6166253 after a lengthy comprehensive selection process we are pleased to partner with hok sport on this critical initiative
6166254 hok has extensive experience in the design of similar basketball facilities and has performed outstanding work for the university on past projects together we will undertake a planning process which will result in greater opportunities for the student athletes coaches and support staff within our basketball programs this will assist in enhancing the outstanding success which is associated with our uconn basketball programs under the direction of our hall of fame coaches geno auriemma and jim calhoun this project is the divisions top priority within our capital improvement master plan for this facility to become a reality we look forward to the ongoing and active participation of the entire uconn family including coaches staff donors and other friends of the university
6166255 our mens and womens soccer teams under the leadership of ray reid and len tsantiris are both elite national programs

6166265 this year will be more highlight driven as we focus on the journeys of some of the contestants from seasons three and four who became household names
6166266 carrie walks us through her idol experience from her audition to her win and discusses with us the highs and lows she went through as part of the process
6166267 she gets very specific with her greatest challenges and uncertain nights as well as what she thought about the competition
6166268 distribution of the series has been great and we expect to be above 95 for the new season
6166269 stations are excited about the changes to the show and soiseth is putting together a more complete book as we rewind the journeys of people that audiences care about
6166270 rewind has always been a phenomenal show and we are now able to make the show the best it can be
6166271 american idol is such a juggernaut that we can now give fans a show that better reflects what fans love about the show
6166272 you want the truth right all right i got up at 12 yah 12 my masseuse brought me nuggets of course im serious though he brought me nuggets i didnt really want to go to the cafeteria so he brought me nuggets and i came straight to the track and my masseuse again brought me more nuggets i just had two though because my coach was saying i shouldnt eat so much nuggets before the race
6166273 to tell you the truth right now i just want to chill out i just want to sleep i wish i was just in sandals right now taking a weekend
6166274 ive been dreaming of this since i was like yea high anything is possible if i put my mind to it im just looking forward to my birthday tomorrow actually im 22 now

6166277 we have to grow the pie the biggest way of quickly growing the pie is in the media area the feeling is that we would get greater revenue for media if we had more regular season games
6166278 its always negotiable but certainly theyd have to pay us more for 18 regular season games
6166279 it s possible in 2012 we may start seeing all nfl games streamed online
6166280 it did not take long for the discussion to center on the olympics with espn executives questioning nbcs decision to tape delay programming from michael phelps races on the west coast to the opening ceremony
6166281 when we put a live bug on sportscenter it means live right now at espn it just would not be part of our dna to tape delay the most important sporting event of the day
6166282 im glad to see that nbc has adopted that approach with the olympics because it validates the approach weve taken for years
6166283 espn is interested in bidding for the next round of olympic games 2014 and 2016 which will take place before october 09
6166284 penguins owner mario lemieuxs threats about moving the franchise if somebody else didnt pony up the cash how arrogant and how classless to say so on the very day that ground was broken for a facility that will line the pockets of the penguins with gold
6166285 the suckers that most public officials are came up with a mix of public gambling and private dollars lemieux calls the moving threats a negotiating tactic but lets call it what it was a lie

6166288 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6166289 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
6166290 i need a best friend who is hot who can keep up with me and most of all who is real and wont be a backstabber
6166291 everyone knows i love la but london watch out im coming to town and bringing my fast paced life with me
6166292 im in the uk all the time but of course i cant bring all my friends so ive decided to look for a new bff across the pond
6166293 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6166294 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6166295 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6166296 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6166297 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6166298 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6166299 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6166300 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6166301 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6166302 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6166303 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6166304 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6166305 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6166306 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6166307 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6166308 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6166309 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6166310 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6166311 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6166312 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6166313 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6166314 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6166315 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6166316 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6166317 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6166318 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6166319 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6166320 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6166321 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6166322 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6166325 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6166326 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6166327 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6166328 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6166329 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6166330 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6166331 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6166332 who are open to doing something on the production side
6166333 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6166334 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6166335 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6166336 nach uns vorliegenden angaben wollen sondereinheiten des georgischen verteidigungsministeriums leichen ihrer soldaten missbrauchen das ausma des zynismus ist schwer vorstellbar die georgische seite pr pariert jetzt die leichen um sie dann als beweis f r misshandlungen an den georgischen soldaten hinzustellen
6166337 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6166338 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6166339 all the boys are talking about it and weve all been on the phone to each other wondering what is going to happen
6166340 i think well be alright this year but we are all a bit worried about the following two years
6166341 its not good for any sport to be losing sponsors and we are just hoping that there will be some good news soon and hopefully we will get a big sponsor to take over the world championship and maybe a few other tournaments as well
6166342 id also like to see more events including some maybe in may or june as it gives you more to practice for and the new tournament in bahrain in november is a step in the right direction
6166343 news about losing sponsors is not good and i was not pleased to read about that but hopefully everyone can get their act together and manage to get somebody else in
6166344 all the players are quite friendly so i hope there is never a split in the sport as it would be sad to lose the other half that i was not playing with
6166345 i dont think it would be good for the sport and i just hope some money comes in sponsorship wise and we dont go down that line
6166346 it is hard to believe that there could be a repeat of last years final at such an early stage and neither of us will want to go home at the start of the week
6166347 it wasnt a surprise to be playing fergal in the final last year as he had been playing well again after a couple of lean years but it just took him a while to come through the rankings again
6166348 i watched some of his matches and the fact that he beat john higgins and ronnie osullivan showed that he was in very good form
6166349 i knew i would have to play as well as i had done in the previous rounds to win and that was how it turned out
6166350 to be honest i havent looked any further ahead than michael or fergal in the second round and i dont really sit down and analyse the draw for the big tournaments
6166351 whoever i play i know i have to play well on the day to win and i dont mind just showing up on the day and playing whoever is put in front of me
6166352 there are only seven ranking tournaments on the calendar so winning two of them and reaching the final of another represents a good season
6166353 i knew my form was alright but i maybe burned myself out a bit ahead of the world championships when you should be looking to be fresh as the matches are a bit longer and everyone is trying that little bit harder
6166354 thats taking nothing away from joe perry who played great snooker at sheffield and just pipped me by a single frame
6166355 the fact that fergal came through to reach the final in belfast and ali carter was a world finalist shows the strength in depth in the sport now
6166356 there are more players coming through every year and doing well in the top tournaments
6166357 nobody fears the top players any more and there are loads of good players out there so the rankings dont mean a lot
6166358 ronnie is that bit ahead of everyone else and we are all playing catch up but really anyone can beat anyone else on the day
6166359 when ronnie is on his game he is sometimes unstoppable and even when his head is maybe not 100 per cent right he can still play great snooker and beat you
6166360 he is definitely the world number one but you just have to concentrate and do your best if you come up against him
6166361 took a total break from the game before easing back into it
6166362 im looking forward to the first tournament in belfast but i imagine there will be a bit of rustiness among all the players not just me hopefully
6166363 i think well all get a bit nervous as we havent felt the pressure for a while having been out of action for two months
6166364 if i dont practice right then i wouldnt even contemplate winning a tournament
6166365 i have to put in four and a half or five hours a day and have been doing that for the last three weeks so hopefully that will be enough to allow me to play well as i did last season
6166366 i guess all the players like spending time with their families rather than being down at the snooker hall but you have to have some discipline
6166367 a great venue where all the boys try to put on a good show
6166368 the fans all love their snooker in northern ireland and it is good to play in an arena with a good atmosphere especially when some of the irish lads are playing as the crowd really gets behind them
6166369 ive played ronnie at wembley and enjoyed that so if i come up against some of the northern ireland lads i will just look forward to it
6166370 only a handful of players that really tie the game up and try to put other players off
6166371 those players know who they are and nobody enjoys playing against them but 95 per cent of the players just go out and play their own game
6166372 i played with a bow tie for my first few years as a professional but developed a neck condition and that really put me off
6166373 i went to the doctor and he managed to get a letter to allow me to play without it

6166376 cara maestra un giorno minsegnavi che a questo mondo noi noi siamo tutti uguali ma quando entrava in classe il direttore tu ci facevi alzare tutti in piedi e quando entrava in classe il bidello ci permettevi di restar seduti mio buon curato dicevi che la chiesa la casa dei poveri della povera gente per hai rivestito la tua chiesa di tende doro e marmi colorati come pu adesso un povero che entra sentirsi come fosse a casa sua egregio sindaco mhanno detto che un giorno tu gridavi alla gente vincere o morire ora vorrei sapere come mai vinto non hai eppure non sei morto e al posto tuo morta tanta gente che non voleva n vincere n morire
6166377 just five years ago last week on august 14th 2003 this country got an object lesson in how big a gamble were taking with our future if we dont change course
6166378 we learned that this time the enemy was us and our failure to take care of our infrastructure
6166379 the worlds greatest nation was shown to have a power grid that was seriously over strained and out of date
6166380 i believe that weve got to be willing to do what some other nations such as france have already done and increase our capacity of safe and clean nuclear generated power
6166381 draw power from the tides of the hudson and east rivers something were already doing on a pilot basis
6166382 which weve estimated could meet nearly 20 per cent of the citys need for electricity
6166383 want to put windfarms atop our bridges and skyscrapers or use the enormous potential of powerful offshore winds miles out in the atlantic ocean where turbines could generate roughly twice the energy that land based windfarms can
6166384 it was actually my manager that introduced us to begin with and he thought we would be very compatible together and thats how it all started
6166385 people have offered other things my way it just wasnt the thing for me but when this came about i felt a great passion for it and thats where it really stems from
6166386 its very bright and fun and then you have your classic blacks and reds
6166387 its about the comfort the pleasure of wearing this bra the comfort the fit
6166388 there are things that i love and things that i dont love about certain pieces that i even had at home
6166389 the second time i met janet she brought this huge duffel bag of bras and we went through them i love i hate i hate ah i hate
6166390 janets very picky about the fit and its got to feel like it fits
6166391 weve just started weve got a long way to go
6166392 we were actually talking about it the other day and nothings been etched in stone but i think we are coming to australia
6166393 for the liberal party to try and blow a hole in that surplus is the height of economic irresponsibility
6166394 of course well talk with all of the senators but ultimately it will be on dr nelsons head if this measure is not supported and he needs to start explaining what the health impact will be if he stops this measure going ahead
6166395 people used to tell him billy youve got to come off the gas a little theres no need to shout
6166396 hed say no problem but he couldnt stop he has one speed 100 miles an hour take it or leave it
6166397 this is an agreement that will establish a missile defence site here in poland that will help us to deal with long range missiles from countries like iran or north korea
6166398 russia in this case will have to react and not only through diplomatic protests
6166399 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6166400 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6166401 it is an agreement which will help us to respond to the threats of the 21st century
6166402 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6166403 but as far as putting holes in the ground in poland we are saying no
6166404 there are no jokes in islam there is no humour in islam there is no fun in islam
6166405 no additional action by the commission is warranted at this time
6166406 a set of simple open data format standards that many are actively developing and implementing for more better structured and web micro content publishing in general
6166407 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
6166408 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6166409 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6166410 ich denke russland sollte wirklich ber gegenschritte nachdenken um gegen seine umzingelung vorzugehen
6166411 we believe the hospital can easily stand a category 4
6166412 we feel it can withstand a category 5 but very few items are tested at a category 5
6166413 we for instance saw new orleans children hospital have to evacuate their hospital because they lost public utilities they had no power
6166414 the helipad is actually built to be able to handle a blackhawk
6166415 so it has the ability to handle 36 000 pounds
6166416 if the border patrol doesnt get you the chicken and burgers will go vegan
6166417 the way i read it peta is making a joke out of the fence not out of ar veganism or mexicans to me it sounds more stephen colbert ish than lou dobbs ish but i guess thats just me i tend to interpret peta a bit differently than many apparently
6166418 shes a great lady and weve done so much together
6166419 i hope shes going to be ok i hope the good lord sees her through this
6166420 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6166421 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6166422 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6166423 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6166424 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6166425 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6166426 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6166427 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6166428 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6166429 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
6166430 my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hears our before him and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight
6166431 the love for a game fowl is just deep in my heart just as much as it is for my wife
6166432 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6166433 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6166434 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6166435 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6166436 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6166437 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6166438 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6166439 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6166440 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6166441 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6166442 participants who ate the vegetarian alternative did not rate the taste and aroma less favorably than those who ate the beef product
6166443 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6166444 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6166445 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6166446 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6166447 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6166448 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6166449 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6166450 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6166451 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6166452 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6166453 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

6166460 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6166461 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

6166546 kobra responds i think it would be helpful as we try to understand one another if we toned down any sarcasm at this point i purposely set out in my post to be diplomatic and fair while i am a lutheran and believe that i am correct to be such considering scripture i didnt intend to sound superior condescending or smug in my post for all my rough edges i do have a desire at times to be fair my post was written during one of these moments
6166547 i think one of the problems here is that kobra as he has been wont to do since i have known him thinks that somehow baptists have never poked their heads out of their sad little non conformist circles and seen the world
6166548 a little smug but lutheranism is itself a little smug

6166588 the bridge deck is in excellent condition due to the diligent preventive maintenance program in place at the international bridge administration iba
6166589 our iba maintenance staff is to be commended for the great job they do to get the full service life out of the bridge deck
6166590 when we consider all of the combined costs for scheduled projects to keep the aging bridge and support facilities structurally sound and safe we are looking at expending over 60 million in the next 15 years
6166591 given that nearly 4 5 million of the 6 million annual toll revenue goes into the day to day operation and maintenance of the bridge we have little opportunity to put funds in reserve to meet these future needs

6166666 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
6166667 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice
6166668 as they live their lives they really do not become very involved with government

6166683 i hate it its ignorant and it makes country music sound ignorant it targets an entire culture and not just the bad people who did bad things youve got to have some tact anybody can write well put a boot in your ass but a lot of people agree with it
6166684 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
6166685 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things
6166686 so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat
6166687 that he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
6166688 i ray geisel did not say i was going to kill any president or senter obama
6166689 its a mistake its a non case its a horrifying political mess
6166690 hed never hurt a person it would be completely against his character
6166691 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6166692 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6166693 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6166694 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6166695 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6166696 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6166697 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6166698 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6166699 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6166700 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6166701 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
6166702 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota
6166703 we can see the youngest one the 11 year old at the gun store taking guns
6166704 its amazing that an 11 year old kid would think of being involved in something like that
6166705 you come to do a burglary on a bus you do the burglary you take your guns and get back on the bus and go home
6166706 yes um theres a maam here and she thinks i broke into the house which i didnt which i was just coming up here

6166714 were approaching a pull the plug kind of decision this is like a last stand for webcasting
6166715 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
6166716 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6166717 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is one of four models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6166718 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6166719 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option
6166720 the lcd screen will have a wider color gamut and higher contrast ratio to deliver deeper more vibrant colors as well as anti reflection technology so you can see the screen more clearly when playing outdoors
6166721 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshipping here in beijing
6166722 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
6166723 but religion like christianity should be subversive it should undermine nationalistic values it should empower the vulnerable it should be a conscience to the state a state should fear it
6166724 if we ask what congregations do the answer is that they mainly traffic in ritual knowledge and beauty through the cultural activities of worship education and the arts they do not mainly pursue charity or justice through social services or politics
6166725 are not religious or ritual activities they are by nature lay or public phenomena
6166726 pietism later sought to fill this gap by creating circles of believers yet without the dimension of outward mission this type of gathering around common pious experiences is immediately threatened with stagnation and becomes little more than communal introspection
6166727 absent that shared sense of mission a deep cultural reality strategic plans no matter how well gathered and formed fail to gain the commitment of energy time and resources for transforming mission

6166809 biden may be a ridiculous overbearing blowhard and hell doubtless make foolish blunders and imprudent comments if hes on the ticket but hed still be an excellent campaigner surrogate and debater hed be thrilled at the prospect of being vice president his own aspirations aside and grateful and proud to have been chosen hed work hard to make obama look good and not deliberately outshine him plus the chemistry will be appealing and they genuinely like and respect each other which will be winningly apparent
6166810 also america is no longer a place where citizens care about plagiarism or hair plugs a biden pick would immediately elevate obamas gravitas give him a semblance of humility delight the media and reassure the nation that a grownup is involved democrats would be simultaneously relieved and apprehensive but theyd be pleased with the choice overall plus biden is catholic is a washington insider in a good way a hardworking man of the people unchanged by three decades inside the beltway and has a tragic history with a happy ending
6166811 i have never suggested and never will that senator mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics and personal ambition

6166813 i will let no one question my love of this country
6166814 obama is pivoting toward a more combative style rebuking the republicans for habitually turning differences over policy into questions about patriotism a habit he said john mccain has readily embraced
6166815 some on the right criticize us and some on the left do too so that must mean were getting it basically right

6166823 i realized how much i had imposed a noise standard that was comfortable to me
6166824 by the time boys are in high school many are quite disengaged from school theyre good bright kids from high achieving families and theyll go to school with their homework and dont even bother handing it in i cant tell you how many mothers ive heard that from their parents are desperate hiring tutors it causes years of family conflict and i think the boys are really set back for a long time
6166825 were working to eliminate the gender gap period and we are supporting boys as well as girls there are better ways to treat all children
6166826 i definitely saw an improvement this year theyre investing themselves adding much more detail and not just scribbling something off to be done with it

6166832 it is our expert judgment that comcasts practices do not constitute reasonable network management comcasts practices contravene industry standards and have significantly impeded internet users ability to use applications and access content of their choice moreover the practices employed by comcast are ill tailored to the companys professed goal of combating network congestion in sum the record evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that comcasts conduct poses a substantial threat to both the open character and efficient operation of the internet and is not reasonable
6166833 comcasts first reaction to allegations of discriminatory treatment was not honesty but at best misdirection and obfuscation

6166843 they see him as a traitor a guy who lies about immigration
6166844 were always concerned about al qaida and like minded groups
6166845 as you look at these type of events they are a very attractive target
6166846 that undoubtedly puts far far more pressure on people and resources than holding it inside

6166889 rising inflation and the rbis attempts to combat it through monetary tightening are leading to fears of the investment boom in india cooling off
6166890 the relentless rise in the flow of fresh capital investments reflects india incs confidence in the continuation of buoyancy in the consumption demand
6166891 it is not a very significant burden to make them cancel their fresh investment plans or stall those under implementation
6166892 our close monitoring of projects through the cmie capex service shows an acceleration in the announcement of fresh investment
6166893 the interest rate hardening was not a roadblock to the implementation of outstanding projects
6166894 these sez are aimed at growing it and ites companies who are choosing to set up centres in adjoining area of tier i cities in view of global economic pressure to reduce costs and maximise returns

6166901 we are specifically reaching out to other children that may have been involved in inappropriate sexual encounters with holly barnes we will handle each allegation in a thorough manner to ensure that the appropriate action is taken
6166902 and now the world must stand for freedom in georgia
6166903 a disproportionate response to a long simmering conflict in the georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia
6166904 and the united states will work with our allies to ensure georgias independence and territorial integrity
6166905 continue to provide needed humanitarian aid to the georgian people
6166906 it is not significant and it needs to increase both the size and pace of the withdrawal needs to increase and needs to increase sooner rather than later
6166907 and it feels even huger on the tight narrow raceway park course
6166908 some of the products have been associated with that investigation
6166909 we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause but food safety and quality at mcdonalds will not be compromised
6166910 we are closely monitoring the situation and are taking guidance from the canadian food inspection agency
6166911 it is with the greatest sadness that snc lavalin learned of a terrorist attack earlier today on a bus carrying its algerian employees to work on the koudiat acerdoune water treatment plant and distribution project in algeria
6166912 to work closely with algerian authorities to ensure the safety and security of all our personnel
6166913 strong contract research revenue coupled with exercise of warrants and stock options ensured that the companys cash reserves remained essentially unchanged during the period
6166914 eating food contaminated with listeria may lead to the development of a disease called listeriosis
6166915 we believe it is important to take these broader preventative actions to respond to this situation promptly comprehensively and in the best interests of our consumers
6166916 we have a strong culture of food safety that these incidents do not uphold and we are taking every step required to maintain our very high standards
6166917 after a period of a selloff here youve got a lot people coming in and covering shorts and bargain hunters coming in looking to establish positions
6166918 upon further review of this matter it now appears that no additional action by the commission is warranted at this time accordingly the investigation has been closed
6166919 the eia data shows a very large increase in crude stocks many had not expected that there could have been so much shipment delay caused by tropical storm edouard
6166920 but less so to consumers given its likely high price
6166921 weaker real sales detracted from our estimates for gdp growth in june depressed confidence sagging job markets and cooling wealth gains are taking their toll on the canadian consumer
6166922 the question is how much will consumption slide going forward ultimately we do not think the slowing in the canadian economy is out of line with what the bank has expected and therefore the bank is likely to keep a neutral bias

6166924 there are quite a few signs of demand warnings from asia it is a new development and it has not been factored in

6166926 my preliminary conclusion is youve got a guy with too much time on his hands and is nosy and was showing people that he had access to all this kind of information and doing favors for friends and looking things up over a period of time
6166927 if it goes beyond that itll be a very serious matter and well handle it appropriately
6166928 it makes no difference what the motivation its a very serious matter and well handle it appropriately
6166929 you just gotta let him go play you gotta let him make a few bad throws here and there and next time check over here check over there i really believe tommy is a young man that can learn from his mistakes and he can make quick good decisions
6166930 hes not there yet and hes not going to tear em up yet although i hope he does but i really believe he has a chance to be a good one for us as we go through the season
6166931 hes been struggling he didnt have a very good summer he missed a whole bunch of workouts going back to florida whatever issues he had but dion has not quite performed at a level he did at the end of last season
6166932 whitlock made about 10 all summer he had issues he had to go back to chester he had all kind of issues
6166933 to freeze all military cooperation with nato and allied countries
6166934 would like to see the united states provide assistance to the georgian military self defense equipment that will help them defend and deter against russian aggression in the future
6166935 we asked them what security needs they had and they were quite specific and quite defined
6166936 were not going to let this aggression stand the world is behind you
6166937 we cant let a bully do this because if they do it here theyll do it other places and if we dont stop it here well have to stop it in a much more difficult way
6166938 not going to prevent the american people from helping you
6166939 i never served them or promoted the groups never helped them and they never helped me
6166940 until any of us have done anything in a game worthwhile to be talking about i think its in our best interest to stick to ourselves and keep working to do whats best for our team
6166941 if you ask jason kidd or chris paul or any of those guys playing in the olympics theyre probably having a lot of fun because they have so many guys they can pass the ball to
6166942 thats what we want to do make sure were distributing the ball to our playmakers and letting those guys make plays for us
6166943 were trying to make sure that no matter who is back there they feel real comfortable and know they have playmakers around them and they dont have to make all the plays themselves
6166944 the quarterback can be the greatest quarterback in the world but if the o line cant protect nothings going to happen anyway

6166946 we know that what those guys did we need to do this year were looking forward to showing people we can
6166947 it gives me the freedom to be a little more reckless out there knowing that i may be able to make this move and have somebody cover my back

6166951 now we want to see what young people around the uk can produce hopefully we are going to find some real stars through this competition because we are sure there is a lot of untapped talent out there
6166952 the theme of the competition is fairly broad so the field is wide open to be as creative as possible we have got some of our students to create an initial video which can be viewed now the challenge to other young people around the uk is to show us you can do something which really stands out
6166953 the great advantage of something like youtube is that a project like making a small video can now reach a vast audience very quickly
6166954 if you look through some of the most popular videos on youtube you will find that great ideas win over high tech equipment every time

6166964 over the past year weve strengthened our u s businesses by selectively hiring top talent from other firms

6166966 a big part of what attracted me to rbc capital markets had to do with the overall firm how its been managed and the strength and stability that i saw within the overall institution
6166967 when it gets a little boring i might pull it out
6166968 we think this is the way the future is going to work

6167039 we broke the huddle and the first guy i looked at was jamie silva bcs safety who was lined up right across from eddie
6167040 i knew silva would try to jump the ball hes a big ball hawk which is what makes him a great safety hes always trying to read my eyes
6167041 being the 2006 starter and having a decent year i got mvp of the spring and did well in august camp things looked good but they unraveled at lsu
6167042 the worst thing about it and what hurt the most was that it was a left hook out of nowhere i never saw it coming
6167043 i saw how much i missed by being on the sidelines and i didnt feel part of the celebrations after games when everyone was celebrating
6167044 i missed it i missed football you lose sight of it because youre under so much pressure we look at it as a business too much youve got to have fun
6167045 i took the attitude that if i ever got back out there i was going to enjoy it
6167046 my mom stopped coming to games after the ohio game
6167047 i was not in a good mood for a couple of weeks
6167048 i was out there throwing the ball around like wed throw it in the back yard
6167049 the pass to eddie in the acc championship game was the best moment of my athletic career because of all that happened during the season
6167050 as bad as last year was i wouldnt trade it playing my best football winning the acc title going to the orange bowl who knows if it happens if i dont get benched
6167051 life is going to be full of disappointments college football has been good for me as a person in that ive learned how to take criticism and learned how to take disappointments
6167052 i wouldnt be disappointed but id prefer to be the one guy
6167053 it probably makes the preparation for us more difficult to have two
6167054 they said were gonna blitz the crap out of tyrod and make him throw quick and when i was in the game theyd drop back in coverage they were going to make it tough to throw and for tyrod make it tough for him to have time to improvise kansas brought the house every play he was a true freshman
6167055 this is my last year there is pressure in that but 99 percent of kids would trade positions with me in a heartbeat im going out and enjoying it have fun while you can
6167056 while hillcrest labs has a great deal of respect for nintendo and the wii hillcrest labs believes that nintendo is in clear violation of its patents and has taken this action to protect its
6167057 when i am in beijing i will make clear to president hu and premier wen that respect for human rights matters to us every year not only the year of the olympics
6167058 i am looking forward to constructive discussion of these issues with the chinese leadership during my visit to beijing
6167059 can you share a few words with horsesass readers about tonight
6167060 yes i work out and take care of myself but i also like a cold beer once in a while
6167061 their friends are quite pleased that theyre getting back together and are trying to give them space
6167062 a girl came up to me on the street and she almost smacked me
6167063 so now marissa is hanging out with racists why didnt she just mention me i can swim and ski and sound white over the phone i also have a job credit cards and a mortgage so there is always an exception to the rule
6167064 i think there are a little more short nerves a little more yelling here and there and a little more intensity
6167065 but the players are responding well to that we really have amped it up and tried to pressure them a little bit and see how they handle that pressure theyve handled it well so far
6167066 theyve been fighting over that role which is a good thing that wasnt the case in the spring we had a lot of quiet leadership but there are more and more guys taking on that vocal role youve got guys at every position doing it which is really a nice turnaround for us
6167067 as coaches were continuing to teach our schemes that well apply throughout the season
6167068 but in our free time weve spent a lot of time looking at film and starting to evaluate those first opponents we have already done a lot of work on those opponents throughout the summer now its just a matter of starting to revisit it
6167069 as part of a triple pack with a terra humara and a wildwood the revaderchi has been ushered into the modern craze with blue lime burgundy and rubine colours popping against the muted safari tones with the whole extravaganza topped off with a multi colour speckle
6167070 this convention in denver is one is which people well known and people not as well known will come together across party lines across geographic divides because they believe in change
6167071 his message all along is that the ideas have to come from the people

6167079 back the fuck up aint gonna fuck with me back the fuck up your life dont mean shit to me
6167080 it shattered everywhere and the glass hit me in the face
6167081 our position is that we are ready to co operate with russia in any project that can strengthen its security
6167082 i think russia really has to think of the response it will make when it finds itself closed in a circle
6167083 in order to have a base you need a decent navy ours is weak
6167084 a base is expensive to keep is it just to have a flag there a show of strength to scare
6167085 georgia began the crisis and the west accuses russia syria suffered the same thing attempts to destabilise the country distortion of the facts and double standards
6167086 the entire front line of the armys brass stepped down because of the war gal hirsch who was defeated in lebanon went to georgia and they too lost because of him
6167087 relying on israeli experts and weapons georgia learnt why the israeli generals failed what happened in georgia is a message to all those the americans are seeking to entangle in dangerous adventures
6167088 i think that in russia and in the world everyone is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis
6167089 if you do not do as we say nobody will play with you
6167090 i remember that field as well as the lacrosse grounds which ran up all the way to sherbrooke street when i was very young my father used to take me on saturdays to see the various teams which competed on the two fields
6167091 magnet spacer attached under the gas pedal with the intent of compromising the chassis dynamometer test
6167092 miroslav djukics contract has been terminated as of today and we have appointed radomir antic as the national team coach for a two year period
6167093 antics contract will be renewed automatically if we qualify for the 2010 world cup in south africa and we are very optimistic about our chances
6167094 i had an idea to base my scoring loosely on mormon hymns that would presumably hint at the unspoken spiritual underpinnings that motivate many of the characters actions or justify them in some characters cases i got hymnals and mormon hymns cds read up on the mormon church and began to practice writing fake hymns
6167095 wouldnt even allow protests in their own designated protest zones in beijing protests that couldnt possibly have hurt anyone
6167096 there used to be some sensitive events and days when we would be watched such as june 4th
6167097 but now its happening more and more it seems to me that extra sensitivity will continue after the olympics
6167098 the pressure is building in the pressure cooker and theres no current avenue for it to be released
6167099 i believe we will see many calls both inside and outside the party to put some sort of reforms on the agenda again
6167100 for many of our pacific island neighbours climate change is a current and unfolding threat to their physical survival
6167101 pacific island countries are saying to the countries of the world including australia including the united states including the europeans including the chinese and the indians that the time for action concrete action over climate change is now
6167102 tuvalu has been crying out about the dire effects of climate change and rising sea levels but nothing concrete nothing tangible has been done to mitigate the problems that they encounter
6167103 there appears to be this concept that climate change is something that is happening out there in the future but it is impacting countries in the region now especially the small island countries
6167104 i am very heartened that the pacific island countries are making their voices heard on the subject of climate change
6167105 climate change is not science fiction as your countries know all too well it is real and present
6167106 these terrorist invaders want war go and give death to the invaders
6167107 whenever something goes wrong they dont threaten the soldiers or president arroyo
6167108 we are the ones who are threatened shot or set on fire
6167109 the problem is these are not ordinary camps they are communities rebels stay with their families if we are going to do action we dont want any collateral damage to the civilians
6167110 the best thing to do for them is to surrender these people to us so that we can prosecute them
6167111 the most serious blunder that this sitting regime could commit
6167112 so sold out that microsoft japan actually put out an official statement about the situation in the land of the rising sun apologizing for the lack of consoles since demand has eclipsed supply microsofts supply has gone totally dry the company is ramping up production and the console will not be shipped to stores until next month
6167113 it sounded like a bit of a vacuum cleaner on the bottom of the boat i finally got up and heres this whale suckling the side of the boat
6167114 it was a very very sad sight it did it for about an hour going from side to side on the boat and at times blowing air under the boat and it just seemed to give a sigh out at one stage as if you know this isnt working
6167115 the most likely outcome but we are not at that point yet

6167118 special dispensation from pope benedict xvi to leave the church to become president with the option of returning to the clergy
6167119 im virtually convinced that when fernando lugo finishes his term he will return to religious life
6167120 has renounced his 40 000 presidential salary and urged other politicians to do the same as a symbol of his vows for economic austerity and transparency
6167121 i have no need of this money which belongs to more humble people
6167122 would be implacable with the robbers of the people in his chronically corrupt nation
6167123 paraguay is one of just 23 countries which recognize taiwan rather than china and there are reports that lugo could switch diplomatic allegiance
6167124 a brief civil war brought the colorado party to power in 1949 five years later a military coup saw general alfredo stroessner installed as president a vainglorious man he employed torture murder and bogus elections to remain in power for the next 35 years
6167125 was overthrown in 1989 75 of paraguayans had known no other leader stroessner was replaced by general andr s rodr guez formerly stroessners right hand man he canceled the countrys perennial state of emergency eliminated censorship legalized opposition parties and released political prisoners the 1993 presidential election of juan carlos wasmosy a free market zealot and former member of stroessners faction inspired a number of nationwide strikes he came under scrutiny for shady business dealings in may 1998 the colorado party reconfirmed its staying power with the election of president raul cubas however he was accused of abusing his powers by freeing conspirator general lino oviedo from prison despite orders to keep him there when vice president luis arga a was gunned down by assassins in 1999 popular sentiment linked cubas and oviedo to the murder and cubas was forced to resign luis gonz lez macchi was sworn in while cubas and oviedo fled to neighboring countries
6167126 in 2000 a judge ordered the extradition from brazil of alfredo stroessner

6167131 great lesson of latin america of the last 70 or 80 years
6167132 of repeating the bloody cycle s that have so definitively marked our continent
6167133 was generally limp grudging and dismissive of a ceremony of hemispheric significance
6167134 were certainly sad to see president nicanor duarte frutos the last colorado party boss being edged out by a man in sandals and an open necked shirt lugo was demonstrating in his dress what he said in his first presidential address that he was going to take some notice at last of the poorest in society and that his special attention would be given to the guaran s themselves paraguays long ignored indigenous people indeed as the paraguayan establishment spluttered to each other lugo had the effrontery to begin his inaugural address in the guaran language
6167135 what no one in the western media was keen to highlight was the fact that with lugo the powerful liberation theology that the late pope john paul ii and ronald reagan had joined in trying to throttle
6167136 la santidad se ofrece a todos es en realidad el destino com n de todos los hombres llamados a ser hijos de dios
6167137 muestra que la santidad no es un lujo no es un privilegio de unos pocos una meta imposible para un hombre normal
6167138 se ofrece a todos naturalmente no todos los santos son iguales son de hecho como he dicho el espectro de la luz divina y no es necesariamente un gran santo el que posee carismas extraordinarios
6167139 hay much simos cuyos nombres s lo dios conoce porque en la tierra han llevado una existencia aparentemente normal sima y precisamente son estos santos normales los santos que dios habitualmente quiere
6167140 para repasar la biograf a y los escritos de cierto santo o santa en particular
6167141 d a tras d a la iglesia nos ofrece la posibilidad de caminar en compa a de los santos escrib a hans urs von balthasar que los santos constituyen el comentario m s importante del evangelio su actualizaci n en el d a a d a y por tanto representan para nosotros una v a real de acceso a jes s
6167142 qu importante y provechoso es por tanto el empe o en cultivar el conocimiento y la devoci n de los santos junto a la cotidiana meditaci n de la palabra de dios y el amor filial hacia la virgen
6167143 sobresal a en hacer destilar de los textos b blicos el sentido que se encontraba escondido en ellos
6167144 ha sido definido tambi n doctor mariano no porque haya escrito much simo sobre la madre de dios sino porque supo captar su rol esencial en la iglesia present ndola como el modelo perfecto de la vida mon stica y de toda otra forma de vida cristiana
6167145 se revel dispuesto a sacrificar privilegios y honores a afrontar incomprensiones y burlas en cuanto que valoraba esta libertad como garant a ltima para la integridad y la coherencia de la fe
6167146 santa rosa sol a repetir si los hombres supieran qu es vivir en gracia no se asustar an de ning n sufrimiento y sufrir an con gusto cualquier pena porque la gracia es fruto de la paciencia
6167147 memoria instituida por el siervo de dios p o xii en 1955 y que la renovaci n lit rgica querida por el concilio vaticano ii ha puesto como complemento de la festividad de la asunci n ya que ambos privilegios forman un nico misterio
6167148 como los colores del espectro en relaci n con la luz porque con tonalidades y acentos propios cada uno de ellos refleja la luz de la santidad de dios
6167149 su ejemplo testifica que solo cuando se est en contacto con el se or se llena uno de su paz y de su alegr a y se est en grado de difundir por todas partes serenidad esperanza y optimismo
6167150 que nos obtenga esta gracia mar a la reina de todos los sanos madre y refugio de los pecadores
6167151 esta crisis muestra la necesidad de encontrar nuevos medios para reglamentar los conflictos internacionales
6167152 es decir medios capaces de privilegiar el di logo y la buena voluntad com n como indic benedicto xvi al rezar este domingo 17 de agosto el ngelus
6167153 medios sin los cuales es dif cil en ste como en otros conflictos seg n dijo el papa garantizar a las minor as tnicas la incolumidad y el respeto de esos derechos fundamentales que no pueden ser violados
6167154 en la base de la crisis estallada en estas semanas en el c ucaso se dan contrastes militares y econ micos tnicos y nacionalistas geopol ticos en el sentido amplio que parece dif cil dirimir la controversia en breve por no hablar de las implicaciones a nivel del derechos internacional
6167155 si bien las armas se han callado de manera bastante r pida la tensi n parece destinada a continuar durante mucho tiempo no s lo entre rusia y georgia sino tambi n en las relaciones internacionales en su conjunto
6167156 entre los estados unidos y rusia se han utilizado los tonos m s duros desde el final de la guerra fr a

6167158 ha sido afectada por tempestades y huracanes acontecimientos ins litos para aquella regi n
6167159 a cuantos de alg n modo han sufrido da o a causa de esta desgracia quiero asegurar mi cercan a espiritual y el recuerdo en la oraci n
6167160 es dif cil valorar desde fuera la delgada l nea que existe entre el retiro cobarde de una posici n prof tica y la prudencia frente a la opresi n para mantener lo que pueda salvarse
6167161 el santo padre ha invitado a ambos grupos sin condenar a ninguno a superar su falta de confianza mutua y a construir la unidad del cuerpo de cristo sobre la base del perd n y la reconciliaci n y la unidad con la iglesia universal
6167162 ha evitado cuidadosamente lanzar acusaciones f ciles y se ha abstenido de dar un juicio moral de condena insistiendo en el hecho de que en las valoraciones morales hace falta tener presentes las verdaderas intenciones de una persona que toma dif ciles decisiones prudenciales
6167163 el principio fundamental seg n el cual en todos los actos morales adem s de la luz objetiva que procede de la ley moral tiene un significado decisivo tanto la consideraci n personal realizada por la raz n del agente como la intenci n interior del agente ser til esperamos a la hora de leer la historia reciente y de superar el clima de sospecha y de desconfianza que con frecuencia produce la vida bajo reg menes totalitarios
6167164 la valoraci n de cuestiones espinosas tomadas en el contexto de la opresi n externa reclaman sobre todo respeto simpat a y un sentimiento de compasi n hacia aquellos que fueron forzados a actuar frente a dilemas imposibles s lo en un clima de respeto y comprensi n podr n ser curadas las heridas provocadas por la persecuci n el miedo y la sospecha
6167165 palabras de cautela para que no se cometan injusticias graves por parte de aquellos que viviendo en un contexto social diferente aplican criterios simplistas en sus f ciles condenas
6167166 es necesario como dijo el papa juan pablo ii en su discurso a los sacerdotes en la catedral de varsovia mayo de 2006 practicar con sinceridad la penitencia por las infidelidades pasadas evitando juzgar con arrogancia a las generaciones precedentes que vivieron en otro tiempo y en otras circunstancias
6167167 es consciente de que la reconciliaci n no puede realizarse de un d a para otro hacen falta paciencia y oraciones
6167168 el santo padre suscita la esperanza y quiere llegar a los corazones de las personas para que el cambio pueda tener lugar por graves que puedan ser las limitaciones de la libertad la gente tiene que elegir de hecho la fidelidad de los cat licos en china a costa de grandes sufrimientos es muy encomiada en la carta
6167169 afirma claramente que la divisi n de la iglesia esta causada desde fuera por determinados organismos
6167170 ha sido escrita con claridad y con caridad caridad con la que el papa solicita la reconciliaci n y el perd n y claridad con la que afirma que la iglesia en china debe construirse sobre la roca de pedro a trav s de la comuni n de los obispos con el papa
6167171 ha tocado el punto crucial del problema la causa original de la ruptura de la unidad
6167172 en los a os recientes la iglesia ha gozado de mayor libertad religiosa que en el pasado pero todav a existen grandes limitaciones que son da inas para la iglesia y de ning n provecho para el estado
6167173 a los cat licos en china se les ha dicho que hay que ignorar la carta que ha sido eliminada de los sitios web a los sacerdotes y asistentes se les ha recomendado que no hablen de ella todo este esfuerzo como ir nicamente ha hecho notar un sacerdote era precisamente lo que hac a falta para estimular el apetito de la gente para buscarla
6167174 lamentan profundamente el accidente acaecido esta tarde en el aeropuerto de barajas y ruegan al se or de la vida por el eterno descanso de las numerosas v ctimas mortales as como por la recuperaci n de los heridos

6167178 tenemos que descubrir c mo podemos ayudar mejor a responder a la pandemia teniendo en cuenta el sufrimiento que sienten los m s pobres y marginados de nuestras comunidades locales
6167179 cuando empezaron a caer las bombas de los aviones corrimos despavoridos
6167180 pero como suele ocurrir en todas las guerras los que han llevado la peor parte de esta carencia de todo han sido los m s vulnerables mujeres ni os enfermos y ancianos

6167183 fruto de una gracia divina que ha querido llevar luz a las tinieblas
6167184 un ejemplo no s lo en sri lanka sino tambi n en el resto del continente
6167185 ninguna diversidad cultural puede impedir a los diversos l deres sentarse juntos ante una mesa para buscar las razones de sus divisiones y valorar los lazos de uni n en orden a alcanzar una coexistencia pac fica
6167186 no s lo en el campo religioso sino tambi n para intentar aplacar el conflicto en el norte del pa s
6167187 los cat licos de sri lanka junto con otros cristianos se han unido a muchos budistas hind es y musulmanes en el ardiente deseo de una paz duradera en el pa s y del final definitivo de antiguas recriminaciones
6167188 estas acciones constituyen un ejemplo concreto de la respuesta disponible y pronta de la iglesia a la misi n que ha recibido de servir a los m s necesitados
6167189 hacer destilar de los textos b blicos el sentido que se encontraba escondido en ellos
6167190 luch y sufri por la libertad de la iglesia y por esta libertad ofreci su disposici n para sacrificar privilegios y honores para afrontar incomprensiones y burlas pues valoraba esta libertad como garant a ltima para la integridad y la coherencia de la fe

6167198 because you know there are so many people waiting to replace you if you mess up

6167221 we knew that we wouldnt have much time to record in a studio because we were about to go shoot disney movie camp rock and right after that wed be on tour with miley so we asked our management team how can we get into the studio to do this we wound up bringing a tour bus out on the road that was retro fitted to be a studio

6167257 whenever the council moves quickly with a purchase of 17m it is never a surprise that people will want the process checked out
6167258 the legislation we work under recognises that there will be times when council needs to make an urgent decision
6167259 it will be no bad thing for it to get external scrutiny
6167260 people need to have confidence we have acted in a correct way

6167301 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6167302 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6167303 davis embarked on what can only be characterized as a witch hunt to identify students who were homosexual and their supporters further adding fuel to the fire
6167304 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6167305 i just felt like i had to stand up for the kids heather wanted to do this and i had to back her
6167306 i think a shirt that says i support gays is very different from a shirt that says gays are going to hell
6167307 one can be very disruptive for a childs self esteem the other supports other people and their ideas
6167308 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6167309 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6167310 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6167311 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
6167312 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota
6167313 hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6167314 he said it wouldnt work he announced his policy toward iraq the day before he left for the first time in over 900 days to visit iraq and then he refuses to acknowledge the surge has succeeded
6167315 no rational observer can go to iraq and see what we are doing for the last years and say the surge hasnt succeeded

6167322 attention if obama becomes presedant i will kill him myself make no mistake about it

6167324 they see him as a traitor a guy who lies about immigration
6167325 were always concerned about al qaida and like minded groups
6167326 as you look at these type of events they are a very attractive target
6167327 that undoubtedly puts far far more pressure on people and resources than holding it inside

6167354 we were selling bottled water for 1 75 dollars per liter right next to a public drinking fountain that dispensed water for less than an eighth of a cent per liter

6167367 western leaders anxiously watching for a withdrawal and puzzling over how to punish moscow for what they called a disproportionate reaction to the georgian offensive
6167368 the june 24 1992 sochi agreement established a cease fire between the georgian and south ossetian forces and defined both a zone of conflict around the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali and a security corridor along the border of south ossetian territories the agreement also created the joint control commission jcc and a peacekeeping body the joint peacekeeping forces group jpkf the jpkf is under russian command and is comprised of peacekeepers from georgia russia and russias north ossetian autonomous republic as the separatist south ossetian government remained unrecognized south ossetian peacekeepers however serve in the north ossetian contingent the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce agreed to monitor the ceasefire and facilitate negotiations
6167369 security corridor along the the border of the south ossetian territories
6167370 it may not be possible to rescue south ossetia tiny and without resources from becoming a russian protectorate or even part of the russian federation and most of its people seem to want that

6167389 the investigators have ruled out all potential accidental ignition sources so it becomes at that point an arson
6167390 they wont be able to determine what arson charges may be made until the investigation is complete
6167391 the details of the investigation are not going to be made public at this time
6167392 if there is information that will aid in the investigation it will be released at that time
6167393 what is certain is that this agreement will lead to the removal of all obstacles facing the resumption of full diplomatic relations between libya and the us
6167394 libya has now left two worlds the arab world which it replaced if only in theory with the african one and the world of the axis of evil and american terrorist lists
6167395 will the libyan people who endured so much throughout the past years be granted their compensation in the form of true democracy freedom of expression and respect for full human rights
6167396 despite the absence of this phenomenon none of us noticed any of the deviant behaviour that keeps occurring back in our holy lands
6167397 there were no attempts at flirtation picking up girls using bluetooth or the other silly moves that highlight our cultural backwardness and moral decadence
6167398 the world is now filled with laws and principles based on a positive outlook towards members of society coupled with strict punishment to anyone who tries to violate them
6167399 as though all that grabbed her attention in the olympics was the absence of saudi women
6167400 this american example which was republished by a prominent french newspaper reflects to a large extent the major difference between what we are putting forward and what the west is putting forward about us
6167401 in order to confront these selected news pieces and we need to change many things in our societal reality we must not exploit these pieces or accept any harm affecting the core of our religion but support this reality with what is most beautiful in our religion our heritage and values
6167402 the arab responses and reactions to the war in caucasia can be described as hasty
6167403 comparisons confirm once again the retreat of the american role in the world and the rise of competing forces led by russia and china

6167506 der gesandte all hs der segen und frieden all hs seien auf ihn sagte ist jemand bereit f r das paradies denn das paradies kam nochniemandem in dem sinn sie ist beim herrn der kaaba ein licht das strahlt und ein wehendes basilikum und ein hoher palast und ein unaufh rlicher fluss und reife fr chte und eine ehefrau die gut und sch n ist und viele gew nder und ein ort auf endloser zeit der keine m ngel aufweist und fr chte und gem se und seide und wohlergehen in einem hohen und sch nen ort sie sagten ja oh gesandter all hs wir sind diejenigen die daf r bereit sind er sagte sagt inshaall h so all h will so sagte die gruppe inshaall h dann erw hnte er den jihad rief dazu auf
6167507 doch der genuss des irdischen lebens ist gar gering verglichen mit dem des jenseits
6167508 in diesen edlen versen sind warnungen und drohungen f r diejenigen enthalten die den jihad aus abneigung dazu unterlassen und die stattdessen bei den angeh rigen und beim verm gen bleiben und sie erf llen nicht die pflicht so seid ermahnt oh besitzer von augen
6167509 o ihr die ihr glaubt was ist mit euch wenn euch gesagt wird
6167510 jene die zur ckgelassen worden waren freuten sich ihres daheimbleibens
6167511 das feuer der h lle ist von st rkerer hitze
6167512 nie sollt ihr mit mir ausziehen und nie einen feind an meiner seite bek mpfen es gefiel euch das erste mal daheim sitzen zu bleiben so sitzet nun wieder bei denen die zur ckbleiben und bete nie f r einen von ihnen der stirbt noch stehe an seinem grabe denn sie glaubten nicht an all h und an seinen gesandten und sie starben als frevler
6167513 wisse oh abneiger von dem was dir vom jihad geboten wurde und
6167514 o ihr die ihr glaubt was ist mit euch wenn euch gesagt wird
6167515 jedem volk ist eine frist gesetzt und wenn ihre zeit gekommen ist dann k nnen sie sie auch nicht um eine stunde hinausschieben noch k nnen sie sie vorverlegen
6167516 und nie wird all h jemandem aufschubgew hren wenn seine frist um ist und all h ist dessen wohl kundig was ihr tut
6167517 jede seele wird den tod kosten zu uns werdet ihr dann zur ckgebracht
6167518 all h st rkt die gl ubigen mitdem fest gegr ndeten wort in diesem leben wie im k nftigen und all h l sst die frevler irregehen und all h tut was er will
6167519 der m rtyrer wird den schmerz des todes nicht f hlen au er wie ein zwicken
6167520 o ihr die ihr glaubt wer sich von euch von seinem glauben abkehrt wisset all h wird bald ein anderes volkbringen das er liebt und das ihn liebt das dem tig gegen die gl ubigen ist und hart gegen die ungl ubigen ist sie werden auf all hs weg k mpfen und werden den vorwurf des tadelnden nicht f rchten das ist all hs huld er gew hrt sie wem er will denn all h ist allumfassend allwissend
6167521 das er liebt und das ihn lieb das dem tig gegen
6167522 sie werden auf all hs weg k mpfen und werden den vorwurf des tadelnden nicht f rchten
6167523 das ist all hs huld ergew hrt sie wem er will denn all h ist allumfassend allwissend
6167524 all h hat von den gl ubigen ihr leben und ihr gut f r das paradies erkauft sie k mpfen f r all hs sache sie t ten und werden get tet eine verhei ung bindend f r ihn in der thora und im evangelium und im quran und wer h lt seine verhei ung getreuer als all h so freut euch eures handels den ihr mit ihm abgeschlossen habt denn dies ist wahrlich die gro e gl ckseligkeit
6167525 nimmt diesen aufruf nicht an au er mit einem deutlichen beweis
6167526 sie werden auf all hs weg k mpfen und werden den vorwurf destadelnden nicht f rchten
6167527 die seelen und das verm gen der liebenden geh ren nicht ihnen so kommt her zum handel
6167528 all h hat von den gl ubigen ihr leben und ihr gut f r das paradies erkauft
6167529 bei all h wir werden dich nicht wieder r ckg ngig machen
6167530 da eure seelen und verm gen nun bei uns sind so geben wir sie es euch vermehrt um ein
6167531 und betrachte nicht diejenigen die auf all hs weg gefallen sind als tot doch sie leben bei ihrem herrn und sie werden dort versorgt sie freuen sich ber das was all h ihnen von seiner huld gab und von freude erf llt sind sie berdiejenigen die ihnen noch nicht gefolgt sind so dass keine furcht ber sie kommen wird und sie nicht trauern werden
6167532 all h der h chste informiert dass er seinen gl ubigen dienern das paradies gew hrt als gegenleistung f r ihre seelen und verm gen wenn sie es f r seine sache opfern und dies ist durch seine gnade gro z gigkeit und seiner freundlichkeit denn er war mit dem tausch gegen etwas einverstanden welches sein eigentum ist und f r etwas was seinen dienern die ihn gehorchen erfreut
6167533 und darin ist eine ausgezeichnete vorz glichkeit f r die m rtyrer und ein vermerk f r die liebe all hs zu ihnen
6167534 der gesandte all hs der frieden und segen all hs seien auf ihn sagte
6167535 niemand wird das paradies betreten und zur gleichen zeit sich w nschen zur erde und den dingen die er hinterlassen hat zur ckzukehren au er der m rtyrer er w nscht sich zur erde zur ck zu kehren um zehn mal get tet zu werden nach dem was er an den vorz gen des m rtyrertums sah
6167536 oh jabir soll ich dir erz hlen was all h zu deinem vater sagte all h hat noch zu keinem
6167537 oh abdullah w nsch dir was f rdich und ich werde es dir geben
6167538 oh herr gib mir wieder leben sodass ich ein zweites mal f r deine sache get tet werde
6167539 es ist mir vorausgegangen dass sie dahin nie wieder zur ckkehren
6167540 und betrachte nicht diejenigen die auf all hs weg gefallen sind als tot doch sie leben bei ihrem herrn und sie werden dort versorgt
6167541 der gesandte all hs der frieden und segen all hs seien auf ihn sagte
6167542 und als eure br der in uhud get tet wurden setzte all h ihre seelen in
6167543 wer wird unseren br der ber uns informieren dass wir lebend im paradies sind und versorgt werden sodass sie im jihad nicht zur ckziehen und im krieg nicht zur ckweichen
6167544 und betrachte nicht diejenigen die auf all hs weg gefallen sind als tot doch sie leben bei ihrem herrn und sie werden dort versorgt
6167545 ich h rte den gesandten all hs der frieden und segen all hs seien auf ihn sagen die erste gruppe die das paradies betreten wird sind die armen immigranten die die hasserf lten vermeiden wenn sie zu etwas aufgefordert werden gehorchen sie und wenn einer von ihnen ein dringendes bed rfnis hat zum govern r zu gehen tut er es nicht bis er stirbt w hrend dieses bed rfnis noch in seiner brust ist all h der h chste wird am tage des gerichtes das paradies herbeiholen dann wird es mit ihrer verzierung und sch nheit kommen all h der allm chtige wird dann sagen wo sind meine diener die f r meine sache gek mpft haben und get t wurden betretet das paradies dann werden sie es betreten ohne abrechnung die engel werden sich dann niederwerfen und sagen oh unser herr wir preisen dich doch tags und nachts und verherrlichen deine gro artigkeit wer sind diese hier die du uns vorgezogen hast er wird sagen das sind meinde diener die f r meine sache gek mpft haben und die dabei leiden mussten
6167546 habt ihr einen wunsch sodass ich es euch erf lle
6167547 oh unser herr was sollen wir uns noch w nschen wo wir doch im paradies fliegen wie wir es wollen
6167548 habt ihr einen wunsch sodass ich es euch erf lle
6167549 bring unsere seelen wieder auf die erde zur ck sodass wir f r deine sache ein zweites mal get tet werden
6167550 der gesandte all hs der frieden und segen all hs seien auf ihn sagte
6167551 all h gew hrleistet denjenigen der f r seiner sache herausgegangen ist und das aus keinem anderen grund au er f r den jihad f r ihn und den glauben an ihn und die wahrhaftigkeit zu seinen gesandten und er ist von ihm berzeugt dass er ihn in das paradies eingehen l sst oder ihn wieder zu seiner wohnung zur ckkehren l sst von der er kam mit dem was er an belohnung an kriegsbeute erlangte und bei ihm in dessen hand die seele von muhammad ist es gibt keine wunde die auf dem wege all hs dem h chsten entsteht au er das er damit am tag der auferstehung kommt als wenn er am selben tag verletzt w re ihre farbe wird wie das von blut sein aber ihr duft wird der von moschus sein und bei ihm in dessen hand die seele von muhammad ist w re es nicht dass es f r die muslime eine last sein w rde so w re ich von keiner milit rischen expedition zur ckgeblieben die hinausgegangen ist aber ich finde keine mittel um sie mitzunehmen noch haben sie genug mittel daf r und es w rde sie besorgen dass sie von mir zur ckgeblieben sind und bei ihm in dessen hand die seele von muhammad ist ich sehne mich danach f r all hs sache zu k mpfen und dann get tet zu werden dann wieder zu k mpfen und get tet zu werden
6167552 kein ungl ubiger wird mit seinem m rder im feuer zusammen sein
6167553 ich habe mit meinem schwert hundert verworfene get tet alle von ihnen dienten andere als all h ich habe keinen standhaftigen mann von ihnen get tet
6167554 oh anas sohn meines vaters ich will nicht auf meinem bett sterben ich will nicht auf meinem bett sterben wo ich doch hundert von den polytheisten in zweik mpfen get tet habe egal auf wen ich auftraf
6167555 dieser hartn ckige satan ist hartn ckig und gibt nicht so schnell auf und er lauert den muslim auf und versucht ihn auf seinem weg zu all h unf hig zu machen und stellt f r ihn fallen und schlingen auf und er verleitet ihn nicht zum niedrigen s nde r ber bis er mit dem h heren nicht erfolgreich war
6167556 wollt ihr etwa die tr nkung der pilger und die erhaltung der heiligen moschee den werken dessen gleichsetzen der an all h und an den j ngsten tag glaubt und auf all hs weg k mpft vor all h sind sie nicht gleich und all h weist nicht den ungerechten leuten den weg
6167557 es ist nicht der intelligent der das gute kennt sondern intelligent ist der der das bessere von zwei guten dingen kennt
6167558 schafft es einer von euchaufzustehen ohne zu essen und zu fasten ohne zu essensolange er am leben ist
6167559 bei ihm in dessen hand meine seele ist der schlaf eines mujahid auf dem wege all hs ist besser als dies
6167560 unser herr ist erstaunt von zwei m nnern und erw hnte einen davon ein
6167561 ich bitte zu all h f r dich mehrals ich f r meine eltern bitte
6167562 und als all h den bund mit denen schloss welchen die schrift gegeben
6167563 wahrlich tut sie den menschen kund und verbergt sie nicht
6167564 der gesandte all hs der friede und segen all hs seien auf ihn sagte
6167565 wenn ihr mit zinsen handelt und an dem melken von k hen h ngt und mit dem anbauen zufrieden seid und vom jihad fernbleibt so wird all h euch eine demut aufb rden welches von euch nicht wieder weggenommen wird bis ihr zu eurer religion zur ckkehrt
6167566 bei all h es wird keiner mit dem gekommen mit dem du gekommen bist au er das er leiden wird
6167567 der anf hrer der m rtyrer ist hamzah und ein mann der vor einem arroganten herrscher stand und ihn tadelte und verbot und er ihn daraufhin t ten lie
6167568 bei all h ich sehe die angelegenheit verpflichtend f r mich zu sprechen und wenn ich nicht in der lage bin uriniere ich blut
6167569 meine f e haben keinen staub auf all hs wege abbekommen dem erhabenen und h chsten
6167570 keiner l sst einen muslim in einer situation im stich bei der seine w rde verletzt wird oder seine keuschheit gesch ndet wird au er dass all h ihn in einer situation im stich lassen wird in der er seine hilfe ben tigt
6167571 w re dir denn nicht lieber dass muhammad an deiner stelle w re und du stattdessen bei deiner familie und deinem verm gen
6167572 bei all h oh mein volk es w re mir nicht lieber dass muhammad der frieden und segen all hs seien auf ihn als loskauf f r mich ein dorn im fu trifft
6167573 am tage da der mensch seinen bruder fluchtartig verl t sowie seine mutter und seinen vater und seine frau und seine s hne jenem tage wird jeder eigene sorgen genug haben die ihn besch ftigen
6167574 was soll ich machen oh anf hrer der gl ubigen wenn sie es ablehnen einen gegen einen zu tauschen
6167575 was ist wenn sie es ablehnen au er mit vier
6167576 gib ihnen f r jeden muslim was sie verlangen denn bei all h ein mann von den muslimen ist mir lieber als jeden polytheisten bei mir denn was du f r einen gefangenen zu befreien ausgibst ist ein erfolg weil du damit den islam kaufst
6167577 oh ihr menschen was ist mit euch das ihr eure religion vergessen habt und eure ehre verlassen habt und euch davon zur ckgezogen habt all hs religion zu helfen so wird er euch auch nicht helfen ihr dachtet dass die ehre den polytheisten geh rt wo all h die ehre doch sich seinen gesandten und den gl ubigen gegeben hat wehe euch empfindet ihr denn keinen schmerz und spaltet es eure seelen nicht wenn ihr einen feind all hs und euren feind auf euren boden hin und herwandern seht das land welches eure v ter mit ihren blut bew ssert haben sie dem tigen und unterwerfen euch wo ihr doch die anf hrer dieser welt waret ersch ttert es denn nicht eure herzen und vermehrt es nicht eure motivation wenn ihr eure br der seht die der feind umgeben hat und ihnen alle sorten von schande sp ren l sst esst ihr denn etwa und trinkt und genie t die sch nen dinge im leben w hrend eure br der dort sind und sich mit dem feuer berdecken und sich das feuer hindurcharbeiten und auf gl hender kohle schlafen oh ihr menschen der krieg ist ausgebrochen und der rufer zum jihad hat gerufen und die t ren des himmels wurden ge ffnet wenn ihr nun nicht zu den krieger geh ren wollt so macht platz f r die frauen damit sie krieg f hren und ihr nehmt das kosmetikum und die eyeliner oh ihr frauen mit den turbanen und den b rten wenn das nicht so ist dann sind hier die pferde z gel und fesseln oh ihr menchen wisst ihr wie diese z gel und fesseln produziert wurden sie wurden von den frauen aus ihren haaren produziert da sie nichts neben dies besitzen das sind bei all h bet ubende siege welches nicht mal das auge der sonne sieht weder erhalten noch besch tzen sie zertrennten es weil die zeit der liebe vor ber ist und die zeit des heiligen krieges begonnen hat der krieg auf all hs wege wenn ihr nicht in der lage seid das pferd anzuf hren dann nimmt es und lasst es eine leere m he f r euch sein das sind die gef hle der frauen habt ihr denn in euch keine gef hle mehr brig
6167578 schwanke oh ihr s ulen der moschee und zerfallt oh ihr steine und seit bewegt oh ihr herzen mit schmerz und kummer wahrlich die m nner haben ihre mannhaftigkeit verloren
6167579 dass die gr ber sich bei all h ber den blen geruch
6167580 ein gef hrte des gesandten all hs frieden und segen all hs seien auf ihn ging an einer schlucht vorbei wo ein bach mit s em wasser war so sagte er ich werde fern bleiben von den menschen und ich werde in dieser schlucht bleiben aber ich werde es erst tun nachdem ich die erlaubnis von dem gesandten all hs habe der frieden und segen seien auf ihn er sagte aber mach es nicht mach es nicht denn die wachehaltung ribat f r all hs sache ist besser als das gebet im eigenen haus f r 70 jahre lang wollt ihr denn nicht dass all h euch vergibt und euch das paradies eingehen l sst so k mpft f r all hs sache wer in der zeit in der man eine kamelin melkt f r all hs sache k mpft dem wird das paradies garantiert
6167581 und wisset m ge all h euch bessern dass einer der gr ten wohltat f r jemanden den all h etwas gutes will es ist dass er ihn zu dieser zeit leben l sst bei der all h seine religion wieder belebt und das motto der muslime wieder erweckt und ebenso den zustand der gl ubigen und der mujahidin sodass der zustand den der ersten generation hnelt von den muhajirin und ansar und wer in dieser zeit lebt so ist er deren folger im guten so obliegt es den muslimen all h dem h chsten f r diese plage zu danken die in wirklichkeit eine edle plage ist eine edle plage von all h dem h chsten und diese fitna drangsal die in ihrem inneren eine riesige wohltat enth lt bei der bei all h falls die erste generation der muhajirin und ansar wie abu bakr umar und uthman und ali und andere in dieser zeit leben w rden so w re ihr liebste tat jihad gegen diese gruppe von verbrechern und niemand bleibt von diesen besatzern fern au er derjenige der diesen handel verloren hat und sich selber betr gt und dem ein gro er anteil in diesem und im n chsten leben vorenthalten wurde

6167688 just shut up you have not the slightest clue what would be good for anyone namely yourself so why dont you just worry about yourself its what youre best t anyway

6167692 human blood is the life line of islam violence its hallmark and gt hate its foundation in the beginning islam lives on the blood of gt infidels when that is unavailable or becomes difficult islam must gt cannibalize itself
6167693 like children playing with dynamite western intellectuals gt journalists and diplomats fantasize that they are achieving results gt in the middle east with their words promises apologies money and gt concessions yet how can such innocents cope with polities and gt societies whose basic ruling ethos is that of the serial killer can gt anyone really expect a stable society capable of progress in pakistan gt when a large majority of the population expresses admiration for usama gt bin ladin and what about the saudi system where as one local writer gt put it the big usama put into practice what the little usama learned gt in a saudi school the radical forces in the region are not expecting gt to retain or gain power by negotiating compromising or being better gt understood they believe they are going to shoot their way into power gt or just as good accept the surrender of those they have intimidated gt that is why so much of the western analysis and strategies for dealing gt with the region are a bad joke
6167694 europe is being targeted for deliberate colonization by muslim gt states and with coordinated efforts aimed at our islamization and the gt elimination of our freedoms we are being subject to a foreign gt invasion and aiding and abetting a foreign invasion in any way gt constitutes treason if non europeans have the right to resist gt colonization and desire self determination then europeans have that gt right too and we intend to exercise it
6167695 there does not exist an identifiable body of muslims substantive in

6167697 muslims who share the same goals as osama bin laden but are pursuing gt them through non violent means are celebrated by gullible westerners gt as moderates
6167698 to say that moderate islam is the solution to radical islam implies gt several things that moderate islam exists that it represents the gt true though perhaps currently disregarded norm of islam and that gt radical islam is a departure from that norm
6167699 the jews should have offered gt themselves to the butchers knife

6167706 we felt that in this game that they were going to live and die by the 3 pointer
6167707 they made a couple we had a couple of defensive breakdowns but we took care of it thats the beauty of this team on the fly we can solve problems without having to call timeouts communication is a big weapon for us nobody is afraid to talk to one another because we all respect one another
6167708 with our team it always comes down to timely hits
6167709 we were often in scoring position but we forgot that we dont need to swing big because yukiko ueno provides the power
6167710 it was a nail biter that could have gone either way

6167772 i think video games are one of the new frontiers for actors and using live action is just another way to connect more easily to the gamer rather than cg or animation techniques

6167899 just five years ago last week on august 14th 2003 this country got an object lesson in how big a gamble were taking with our future if we dont change course
6167900 we learned that this time the enemy was us and our failure to take care of our infrastructure
6167901 the worlds greatest nation was shown to have a power grid that was seriously over strained and out of date
6167902 i believe that weve got to be willing to do what some other nations such as france have already done and increase our capacity of safe and clean nuclear generated power

6167931 i didnt think it would be very good but once i tried it it was good

6167934 a folkier feistier version of another scottish singer songwriter kt tunstall macdonald digs into roots pop while adding some native accents her rich resonant voice packs plenty of power and passion

6167943 this is an economic opportunity that county governments across the country should be looking into bergen county is showing leadership by not only talking about it theyre actually committed to it
6167944 ill wager that the evidence against posada which i find compelling is more solid than the secret evidence against most of the detainees at guantanamo but posadas alleged crimes were against the castro regime
6167945 so for now posadas a free man even though the administration has sufficient evidence to arrest him for his role in either the 1976 airliner bombing or the 1997 havana bombings for that matter posada easily could be detained under section 412 of the patriot act which calls for the mandatory detention of aliens suspected of terrorism
6167946 the reason this case has attracted so much attention is that mr posada is not just another cuban immigrant to his supporters he is a genuine hero of the anti castro cause to his detractors he is a vicious terrorist to judge cardone he was like any other defendant who is entitled to certain rights under the u s constitution
6167947 the alternative for the us prosecution is to come up with evidence that mr posada is a terrorist and present it before an impartial judicial forum if it cant do this the government should leave him alone
6167948 no artists or labels have complained the site is not closed indefinitely stay tuned

6167953 the great weapons of modern war did not count in single lives it took a whole section to make a target worth a burst of machine gun fire a platoon or a motor lorry worth a bomb

6167956 kylie opened the door and threw boiling hot water on his face and his chest and he said oooh yeah
6167957 i dont think we can make a quid pro quo there that this is causing the effect and they certainly dont deserve that behavior but we do have some of these stands that have been victimized by these activities
6167958 the reason weve done so well as a civilization over the past 300 years is specialization i dont fix my own computer i dont produce my own tv programs i do very few things but hopefully i do them well

6167969 as well the proportion who reported becoming sexually active at a very early age decreased
6167970 however among those who were sexually active there was no significant change in the likelihood of having multiple partners or for males using condoms so while some adolescents have adopted measures to reduce their risks of sexually transmitted infection and unwanted pregnancy others report high risk behaviour
6167971 dream is not that what you see in your sleep dream is the thing which do not allow you to sleep
6167972 i sometimes tell stories that i have heard or experienced but mostly we have tried to avoid the subject
6167973 i hear things all the time that i chalk up to spending time in old buildings my imagination or whatever every now and then though i find myself walking out to the main entrance calling hello is someone there when there isnt anyone there
6167974 they found primarily evps electronic voice phenomena recordings that are not heard by investigators but recorded on electronic media like tape recorders or digital recorders and audio recordings that were actually experienced by investigators the really spooky thing is that some of them supported the stories we have been told by psychics who have been invited to visit
6167975 we serve sports fans its hard in our culture to fathom tape delaying in the same way they have im not suggesting it wasnt the smart thing for them to do but its not our culture we did euro 2008 in the afternoon weve done the world cup in the middle of the morning

6167984 apart from the new media which journalist has ever spoken of the revelations made by this great man andreas von b low
6167985 i refused i told them repeatedly that my job is a journalist not a spy and that it was my duty to make the truth known and to work for the respect of human rights
6167986 the interrogations were the responsibility of colonel morgan a specialist psychiatric doctor this colonel was stationed in guant namo from march 2002
6167987 he gave instructions to the officers who were torturing us studied our reactions then noted every detail in order to be able to adapt the torture techniques to each detainee which had profound psychological consequences
6167988 i saw british and canadians they came to find out about the interrogation techniques and also to supply the cia and fbi with advice on how to torture and interrogate from what they had learned
6167989 89 of the prisoners in guant namo were bought for hard currency from the pakistani authorities
6167990 the terrorist attacks of 11th september 2001 were immediately used as a pretext by tel aviv and washington to direct international policy towards military objectives which had been planned for a long time
6167991 in particular they were the pretext for wiping out any form of resistance to their criminal policies starting with palestinian and muslim resistance
6167992 after the break up of the soviet empire the islamic world was labelled the new axis of evil
6167993 from the early 90s the us and israel have worked to arouse fear of and intolerance towards muslims to influence secret services of different countries to infiltrate and finance them to encourage the underdogs to carry out terrorist attacks in order to then point the finger at them and justify coercive measures kidnappings torture and arbitrary detention
6167994 i cant give anything away but this series has a lot of surprises in store for viewers
6167995 eve is great so easy to work with shes lovely and good fun on set but a true professional too
6167996 what makes our job so much easier is that the people of cardiff are so supportive

6168008 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6168009 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6168010 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6168011 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6168012 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6168013 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me
6168014 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6168015 is this another civil rights issue almost all people who break the law think that the law is unfair unjust and discriminatory how many people think that police officers are harassing them when they obviously are in violation of the law
6168016 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
6168017 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
6168018 we are pushing for a grand deal looking at the whole area
6168019 our aim is to draw up options by october which if all iraqi parties work consistently on those could provide a peaceful political solution which eventually may be confirmed or sanctioned through a confirmatory referendum
6168020 have me as a man who ended a relationship stand here and write some truth have me stand up for somebody and write that jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think ive ever met shes one of the most lovely people ive ever met in my life and im going through something thats a very personal thing and you have to give that up
6168021 she is so intent on getting married and having children he felt hemmed in
6168022 i think you will find as we get into september that what the people of britain are concerned about is what is happening to their mortgages what is happening to their gas and electricity bills what is happening to the oil price and the petrol price at the pumps
6168023 these are the issues they want us to address and look at youll see us dealing with some of these issues as we come back in september
6168024 i dont know not really i guess i dont think about it that much
6168025 when i think about it though i always think that somehow youll get better i know its not logical or realistic but its what i always think
6168026 in some ways its going back to the kind of work i did earlier in my career where i did more of the arms and legs work
6168027 and at ibm there was a long line of people behind me here the line is pretty short
6168028 much more needs to be done to create the access necessary for the oil industry to do what it does best and develop this countrys resources to secure our
6168029 this is where we have found success and we are the clear leader
6168030 we came here to win and we are leaving winners
6168031 bad airflow in your case we wont replace your card or
6168032 this will help us to deal with the new threats of the 21st century of long range missile threats from countries like iran or from north korea
6168033 missile defence of course is aimed at no one it is in our defence that we do this
6168034 we have to remember that western countries have certain values and principles in common
6168035 we have to stand up for these principles and we have to defend them
6168036 we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
6168037 our neighbours should now understand that our nation will never give in nor allow itself to be intimidated
6168038 obviously there is a certain environment you are operating in you cant deny it
6168039 it is a difficult time but i think we shouldnt overstate the depth of the difficulties the cold war is over
6168040 they said after a long and sleepless night based on our conversation yesterday weve determined youre not a good fit youre not what we want
6168041 she has held for 20 years the highest level of security clearance and it has been renewed since she transistioned theres no issue with security clearance here
6168042 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
6168043 but revolution what about technological progress and efficiency the environmental and sustainability movements isnt all that enough
6168044 until independence is declared the continent will feel itself like a man who continues putting off some unpleasant business from day to day yet knows it must be done and is continually haunted with the thoughts of its necessity
6168045 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6168046 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is one of four models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6168047 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6168048 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option

6168255 its one of the roles na gusto kong magawa ang sa akin ang dream ko is to be able to portray as many characters as possible yun lang kasi masyadong maiksi ang life span naming mga actors
6168256 yung portrayal ng buhay sa totoong buhay ng 20 or 30 years old kung nage experiment sila about sex drugs or marriage kung anuman yun ang gusto kong i portray
6168257 oo everytime pero yun din na realize ko na madali para sa aming mga artista na humiling or makaisip na mag portray ng something off beat para maiba pero na realize ko na after doing one more chance a very special love playing these characters na hindi ganoon ka off beat actually parang common people pa nga yun pala yung mas mahirap

6168261 ako willing ako to do it kahit sinong lalaki pa as long as alam kong lalaki talaga ako
6168262 kahit na mukhang parang off noong nai imagine ng mga tao pero kapag alam mong sila ang gagawa hindi ka mae exploit not in anway hindi ka magmumukang malaswa because ang star cinema ay gumagawa ng pelikula kahit may ganyang eksena hindi para magbigay laswa kung hindi portrayal yan of life yun lang ang gusto naming maihatid

6168271 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

6168292 the iphone 2 0 2 software update improves communication with 3g networks
6168293 the kicker is it does show three bars of 3g instead of one with 2 0 1 so it looks like they just changed the way the bars look with this update now thats useful
6168294 my new iphone 3g i almost threw it out my car window today it dropped 12 calls within four hours in downtown houston that is crazy
6168295 i live in the centre of the u k s second largest city and my 3g reception is intermittent between five bars and zero therefore the connection keeps getting stuck

6168303 for me it is important to be captain but it is important what moment the players are in
6168304 the first eleven will be the best players for me not because they are the captain we have a vice captain rio ferdinand
6168305 sometimes in my career i spoke with the captain but usually i decide
6168306 i prefer that i decide everything always i speak with my staff and ask different questions but the last decision is mine i think it is very important to know a lot of players as captains you have to know the players and then choose not because someone tells me this player is good but because i made the decision
6168307 just that they have australia coming up and they were excited that we won and they gave whoever they played a beat down
6168308 and they want to keep it up and we both want to win gold medals
6168309 if they india have any problem we are happy to assist without any reservation

6168311 we have had to advance the tournament to august because of aiff directives mohun bagan east bengal and mohammedan sporting will not take part in the tournament as the dates clash with their local league

6168453 he said we should get in early because then it doesnt cost as much the longer you wait to get in he said the more it will cost you and if you dont get in at all then it will be painful after november after the democrats win the majority
6168454 then he referred to bronx state sen jeff klein about four times as his enforcer who is going to be brutal aggressive about collecting the contributions and that he was the one managing the ipo

6168479 cell phones provide significant economic gains for low income american households

6168518 her decision to be part of the hyundai marketing experience is just another example of the automotive industrys growing realization that the hyundai brand is a formidable and ascendant player in the marketplace a brand with tremendous upside and opportunity
6168519 we also did a lot of great stuff in print

6168592 we risk a reinforcing spread of inflationary impulses and expectations
6168593 the market is clearly much more worried about slowing growth and the credit crisis than it is about any monetary response from the fed to try to fight inflation

6168605 our first u s hybrid is going to be the sonata
6168606 the oil number was quite bearish but the gas quite bullish
6168607 you are seeing this tug of war between commodity fundamentals and also what are the u s economic fundamentals
6168608 that is what is causing oil to go up and down
6168609 way more than what the market was looking for and as a result we have come off our highs
6168610 you are just picking up some extra cargos that are just getting counted
6168611 we generally do work off inventories at this time of year a draw is not unusual
6168612 we went from being well above average to now just below the 5 year average
6168613 in the grand scheme of things on an absolute level it is not that bad
6168614 what we are seeing is a global slowdown in the economy and that is contributing to the weaker demand numbers that we have seen
6168615 that concept is starting to change these high prices are having an effect on global growth and it will slow down demand going forward
6168616 now people are looking at the market with more reality

6168622 these actors and athletes understand that sport and play are critical tools to help children and communities in disadvantaged areas of the world build a healthier more peaceful future
6168623 i believe in the positive power of sport and play for children
6168624 in addition to keeping kids out of trouble and engaging them in a constructive activity sports teach children many lessons and values including teamwork and determination the festival cup is a great opportunity to help support the important initiatives of right to play
6168625 everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities at this difficult time
6168626 how much in your experience do children tend to elaborate or exaggerate and fill in details especially after a traumatic experience like that
6168627 even as volkswagen is preparing its site at enterprise south unum has announced a 20 plus million investment bluecross blueshields new headquarters has entered the final phase of construction memorial is planning a 300 million expansion that will add hundreds of healthcare jobs and alstom is transforming the western part of our downtown riverfront with a 300 million project that helps re establish chattanooga as a hub of the power generation industry i cant remember a time when our prospects were as bright
6168628 that dedication is paying off as companies announce new jobs and investment
6168629 during the past year the chamber directly assisted 10 companies not including volkswagen announce 335 million in investment 704 new jobs and 300 saved jobs
6168630 although the recent correlation in dollar and oil prices is clear it is important to emphasize that each of these assets are driven by multiple varying factors put differently there is more to oil than the u s dollar and vice versa

6168641 why thank you lord for all is well with my heart and soul
6168642 as a supporter of john mccain i hope your guest dr marc lamont hill speaks for obama more often pithy enough
6168643 finally an interview that points out specifically what we want to know about barack obama best segment this news junkie has seen on the election so far
6168644 the statement about jesus supporting abortion rights deeply disturbed me and my family thou shall not kill is impossible to misinterpret
6168645 jesus was indeed a radical i believe he would have supported the well being of women and the right of babies to live
6168646 marc lamont hill has to be drunk on kool aid if he thinks jesus would agree with obamas view on abortion
6168647 your guest from temple university is obviously in the tank for obama he should focus less on putting words in jesus mouth and more on bringing philadelphias black on black crime rate down
6168648 there is an old saying it is better to be silent and let them think you are a fool than to open your mouth and dispel all doubt
6168649 sen obama isnt going to appear on your show hed rather get elected on his celebrity status than have people confused with facts
6168650 i think the country knows enough about obama im concerned that obama doesnt know enough about the country
6168651 the flaw you see in obamas campaign is actually the strategy when obama is specific about policies his numbers go down so he wants to stay an abstract unchallenged linguist
6168652 neither my husband nor i can understand how someone can defend voting for a candidate like obama when he has clearly not defined his stance on most foreign policy issues
6168653 we have a better chance of seeing you on foxs late night program red eye than seeing obama on the factor
6168654 i think it would be great if george clooney would advise obama on matters of national security after all mr clooney was once batman
6168655 whats next barbra streisand as secretary of state and alec baldwin as secretary of defense give me a break
6168656 nobody including barack obama should care what george clooney thinks like the other hollywood actors he is nothing more than a court jester paid to entertain us
6168657 george clooney advising barack obama on foreign policy is the blind leading the blind and the american people must be blind if they vote this man into office
6168658 maybe george clooney was just offering obama a starring role in his new movie the script hasnt even been written yet and already theres oscar buzz based on obamas brilliant performance of someone who knows what hes talking about
6168659 what makes an actor an authority on politics i dont think the american people will pay much attention to what george clooney thinks
6168660 what about tiger woods hes a dedicated athlete with extraordinary talent
6168661 michael phelps is a great athlete but lance armstrong won the tour de france seven times nothing against mr phelps accomplishments but he doesnt have to swim uphill
6168662 im 13 years old and i think you are funny those big words at the end of the show confuse me but thats ok
6168663 bill please stop confusing my grandmother by using the terms far left and far right instead of democrat and republican now shes convinced we have a four party system
6168664 everywhere i go i see t shirts and bumper stickers with obamas face on them im getting dizzy from all the spin
6168665 thanks for your segment on paul newman he was a star when movies had substance and were worth watching
6168666 paul newman is a great actor and family man he didnt need drugs affairs or obnoxious political opinions to be successful
6168667 paul newman deserves high praise for his work as an actor for being a man who honors the sacrament of marriage and for his enormous generosity in charitable work he is definitely a great american actor but more importantly hes a great american
6168668 i have been head over heels in love with paul newman since my pre teen years i always believed he never got proper credit for his enormous acting ability because he was so incredibly good looking
6168669 i grew up and old watching all of paul newmans movies he is truly a man of fine character
6168670 besides his obvious talent i respect paul newman because hes been married for more than 50 years thats got to be a hollywood record
6168671 elizabeth edwards was an enabler knowing what she did about the affair she should have stayed home
6168672 some of us havent forgotten how elizabeth edwards defended her husband bringing dick cheneys daughters sexual orientation into the debates as a couple john and elizabeth edwards have exceeded even the clintons in nastiness
6168673 elizabeth edwards supporting her husband makes her a hero to me
6168674 i wish bernie would skip the comments about elizabeth edwards
6168675 elizabeth edwards is just as guilty as her husband they were both living a lie and selling it to their supporters
6168676 voltaire once said everyone is guilty of the good they do not do
6168677 id like to see how an american carol stacks up against all the anti american hate movies at the box office
6168678 youre fooling yourself if you think the reviewers are going to give it a chance i predict it will be a box office smash despite what we know they will say
6168679 personally im very happy you didnt slap michael moore in the movie i would hate to see you get your hands dirty
6168680 im so excited to see that an american carol is coming out the day before my husbands birthday hell be pleased to watch it
6168681 the movie looks great and its opening on my birthday what a great present for me
6168682 good for you oreilly on your michael moore spoof im convinced that if a cockroach was as large as a human being it would look just like michael moore
6168683 karma michael moore gets a cinematic pie in the face
6168684 i loved the preview i would see it just because of its lampooning of michael moore but with you having a cameo ill camp out in front of the theatre to make sure im first in line
6168685 i usually dont go to see comedies but this is one i just cant miss
6168686 im 16 years old and watch the factor every night i thank you for sharing your no spin philosophy i now know a lot about the election
6168687 i just bought myself a no spin t shirt to wear in my high school government class i thought it would be a nice little thorn in my liberal teachers side
6168688 we are not an anti military organization in any way
6168689 we are reaching out to folks saying hey this is who we are we believe the troops should be withdrawn
6168690 and send the message you are not alone if you are concerned about the state of our union
6168691 the very first thing a soldier pledges is allegiance to the constitution
6168692 we know how lonely it can be to oppose the war and be in uniform
6168693 sports drinks are to drinking what hummers are to driving the effective marketing of a fantasy
6168694 you generally dont need a hummer to navigate the streets of your average suburb and you dont need a sports drink for the energy exerted getting up off the lounge chair to change the channel on your television
6168695 ive actually been given an education by the people in this industry
6168696 and i have no doubt about the science of showing that these drinks may be uniquely beneficial for hydrating someone at risk of being dehydrated but unless you are at risk of being dehydrated there is no benefit here
6168697 you see multi colored sports drink options in every mini mart along every highway in the country and i am really curious to know how many ultra marathoners and tour de france riders are rushing into those mini marts on a routine basis
6168698 if you are engaged in a high intensity sport like for example being on the florida gators football team and training in 100 degree heat you are actually at risk of dehydrating and a sports drink may really help you out
6168699 i live here on less than a dollar a month

6168706 in a situation like this i essentially have no legal recourse the citibank policy doesnt go against any protected rights businesses are totally within their rights to discriminate against people who work in any sector of the adult industry regardless of the legality of that work but i can and did take my money elsewhere and i told them exactly why
6168707 drunk people with issues is one of the reasons i burned out on stripping this is even scarier to me because the system has forced me to depend on these people for my safety there is no safety if their minds are altered there is no such thing as a bouncer in this brothel i wish there were

6168713 the power that is distributed through the system doesnt equate to the revenues that gpa is supposed to be taking in revenue loss drives up rates for all paying customers and theres also a loss of revenue that cannot be reinvested back into our power system
6168714 we have been receiving very positive feedback since we launched chi bi on august 6 2008
6168715 the fact that we and perfect world completed the localization work within two months after signing the licensing agreement not only demonstrates perfect worlds extensive experience in localization but also shows the better collaboration we were able to accomplish with perfect world

6168905 in the latest tests the tiguans performance is a standout
6168906 it sailed through the front and side crash tests without a single downgrade for structure or measures of injury likelihood recorded on the dummy this is one of four models in this group that afford superior crash protection in their class this is a huge change from just five years ago when most small suvs were rated either marginal or poor in our side test and standard side airbags and electronic stability control were rare
6168907 weve rarely seen a vehicle go in the wrong direction and get a worse rating after it has been redesigned
6168908 since they didnt ask us to test the 2008 equinox with its optional side airbags we have to assume it means gm didnt expect it to perform much better even with the option
6168909 it seems the only group that is not off limits is us krauts even our own companies come up with utterly ridiculous commercials for american tv but thats okay have a go you see we are not humorless after all
6168910 but the hands down winner of the show watched only by what we call warmduscher or warm shower takers has to be the national spelling bee who gives a f about kids trying to spell complicated words other than their parents who would have been attending the live event

6168913 interactive media design is all about matching creativity with the technical know how to do something like putting together a video and placing it on the web
6168914 our students do the most amazing work and are winning some of the best jobs going in high tech and creative industries we want to give a big shout about that
6168915 a genius piece of work though i say so myself
6168916 now we want to see what young people around the uk can produce hopefully we are going to find some real stars through this competition because we are sure there is a lot of untapped talent out there
6168917 the theme of the competition is fairly broad so the field is wide open to be as creative as possible we have got some of our students to create an initial video which can be viewed now the challenge to other young people around the uk is to show us you can do something which really stands out
6168918 the great advantage of something like youtube is that a project like making a small video can now reach a vast audience very quickly
6168919 if you look through some of the most popular videos on youtube you will find that great ideas win over high tech equipment every time

6168951 parliament clearly intended that councils should use the new powers and generally they are being used to respond to residents complaints about fly tippers rogue traders and those defrauding the council tax or housing benefit system
6168952 dog fouling is at the top of their list in terms of issues they want the council to be tackling on the ground so i know the public are only too pleased to see us catching people
6168953 i dont think councils are abusing their powers but there have been one or two instances where it could be said that perhaps some of the offences being investigated were too trivial to be using surveillance techniques
6168954 this is about using quite serious powers that are meant for crime not minor matters
6168955 we need stronger checks and balances against the potential abuse of such powers to protect the rights of law abiding citizens from labours growing surveillance state

6168960 its a yorkshire tradition men wearing flat caps although youngsters dont bother these days older men still wear them and should be allowed to continue

6168964 the fact that she did not report her concerns resulted in a failure to protect the interests of patients because any action to be taken by the trust was delayed the very act of filming a patient without consent is a serious matter in itself irrespective of whether no further dissemination of the footage takes place

6168969 do we really want the police security services and other organs of the state to have access to more and more aspects of our private lives
6168970 im not saying its right or wrong but i think there should be absolute full transparency
6168971 we do have to stand up and say these are our fundamental liberties and our freedoms and lines have to be drawn somewhere and there should be a full democratic debate about where exactly the lines should be drawn
6168972 the changes to the way we communicate due particularly to the internet revolution will increasingly undermine our current capabilities to obtain communications data essential for counter terrorism and investigation of crime purpose and use it to protect the public
6168973 to ensure that the agencies can continue to use this valuable tool the government is planning to bring forward the communications data bill
6168974 putting all this data into the hands of the government will threaten our security not make it better
6168975 ministers have shown time and time again that they cannot be trusted with sensitive data there is no reason to think they will be any less slapdash with our phone and internet records

6168980 a waste collection authority is not obliged to collect household waste that is placed for collection in contravention of a requirement under this section
6168981 it is disgraceful that these new laws are being rushed through parliament with no debate and no vote
6168982 people genuinely want to improve recycling and go green but labours policy of bin cuts and bin taxes will fuel fly tipping backyard burning and harm public health
6168983 these changes will fuel the public backlash at the governments rubbish policy under gordon brown local residents are paying exorbitant levels of council tax but are failing to get decent public services in return
6168984 it is in no way in councils interests to use tactics that would alienate local people it would be wholly counterproductive for town halls to approach this issue in a heavy handed way that could put people off dealing with their rubbish responsibly
6168985 councils always provide people with straightforward information about what to do with their rubbish and work with residents to reduce the amount they produce and to encourage them to recycle
6168986 britain is the dustbin of europe throwing away more per household than any other country in the eu we have to change radically the way that we get rid of our rubbish and the days of tipping everything into a hole in the ground are long gone
6168987 there is still a general duty to collect rubbish free from households all that has changed is that when a household is given a formal notice if they dont abide by it then the council no longer has a duty to collect

6169025 really source of proof please science observation proves you wrong and a habitual chronic pathological liar as well
6169026 on june 12 1980 a third explosive eruption produced 25 feet of stratification that amazed geologists successive layers are traditionally thought to require long periods of time to form yet upwards of 100 layers accumulated mostly between the nighttime hours of 9 and 12 while a plume swiftly ascended nine miles above the mountain wave after wave of pyroclastic flows began hurtling out of the crater and down the north slope each dusting the valley below with another lamination measuring from a fraction of an inch to over a yard in thickness each took from a few seconds to a few minutes to form
6169027 geologist steven austin described these pyroclastic flows as ground hugging fluidized turbulent slurries of fine volcanic debris they moved down the mountainside at hurricane speeds and left deposits of 1000 degrees f one would expect each deposit to be homogenized amp thoroughly mixed remarkably these high velocity slurries of red hot ash and pumice separated into coarse and fine particles of perfectly defined layers such features follow laws governing flows demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks
6169028 similar thin layering appears in the tapeats sandstones of the grand canyon
6169029 yup you could explain to me that you have observed first hand the layering in your septic tank too im sure there is an analogy here but it escapes me at the moment do tell what is the connection
6169030 i suppose you did read darwins radio your choice of reading materials reveals a lot dawkins specialties are fiction and fantasy not observable science his much acclaimed among fools weasel analogy was a complete fraud youre clutching at fables in a last ditch effort to avoid the conclusion that there is a god to whom you will answer one day youre not ready for that
6169031 hey bj antibiotics kill bacteria not viruses you cant kill viruses with antibiotics and viruses dont mutate in response to antibiotics theyre unaffected sheesh i would have thought you would get it the first time you were corrected your knowledge of science is pathetic and youre a very dense slow learner
6169032 so we have layer upon layer fair enough of varying thicknesses of pyroclastic flows why is that such a big deal and yet again i gave to remind you that such layers are not sedimentary
6169033 yah and bears make big potty in the woods so what are you still beating that one trick pony i regret to inform you but your hobbyhorse is dead
6169034 are you a complete freaking idjit the point is that the aggregates were not only layered but segregated according to aggregate size what you have at msh is 25 feet of finely layered segregated aggregates laid down in 3 hours not a long series of separate volcanic eruptions one ringy dingy two ringy dingy if you cant comprehend the material go back to the nursery and retrieve your binky
6169035 for anyone who just tuned in see 7 wonders of mount st helens
6169036 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6169037 they maybe layered but they formed as a result of volcanic activity so they are not sedimentary rocks sorry for shouting but hopefully it may sink in eventually
6169038 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6169039 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen this presents a problem if you believe in uniformism and evolution
6169040 actually crime is on the rise especially rape and murder it may still be low but for countries with small populations its a drastic increase on top of that scandinavia in particular norway has cultivated and spawned some powerful anti religious movements the black metal movement that grew to infamy in the 1990s hit the national newspapers with almost one hundred church burnings and espoused a venomously anti christian doctrine its adherents worshipped odin the norse gods and satan they wanted not only the continued decline of christianity but a revival of nordic paganism in addition scandinavia has a healthy population of laveyan satanists so there still religious the just don t follow the bible paganism has always been in scandinavian countries and its been on a sharp rise in the last 20 years santa clause is worshipped every year all over the world santa came from the scandinavian religions of old so there quite religious just not christian
6169041 why would i do that the bible goes all the way back to creation its not given by an angel of light
6169042 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why
6169043 your density amazes me both gas charged slurries which formed the msh strata and water charged slurries which formed the tapeats strata follow the same laws of physics i e they follow laws governing flows of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks the volcano has demonstrated that such formations can be formed rapidly a global flood would have produced tapeats in a brief time
6169044 the difference is that this demonstration of the behavior of fluidized turbulent slurries of debris at msh was a gas charged slurry while the flood was primarily a demonstration of the behavior and end results of water charged slurries on a much more massive scale the flood also involved the laying down of volcanic debris but the whole demonstration was inundated with water for a year so what happens when volcanic debris is thoroughly mixed with other types of aggregates and subjected to the conditions that have already been demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks hm m m m would you not get the rapid formation of a great number of segregated layers of sedimentary rock in a very short period of time good grief man the ancient romans used volcanic sand and ash to make concrete doesnt that tell you anything
6169045 you also said they were living matter which they are not now that is an interesting hypothesis viruses which are not alive mutate therefore proving evolution in living things somebody help me with this i swear that somewhere i read that the flatworm was evolving faster than the human my thought then why are they still flatworms
6169046 red bloods cells in a 65 million year old fossil
6169047 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive
6169048 one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life
6169049 modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen
6169050 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
6169051 no the simple answer is that the drawings are based upon fear of the afterlife and legend
6169052 i would expect that from someone who is simple minded
6169053 red bloods cells in a 65 million year old fossil
6169054 oh boy you actually think you got me on that one did i ever imply that she was a creationist in fact i am glad she is not because if she were a creationist then oh boy how simple it would be to dismiss her discovery get it indeed i like the fact that she is not doh the point of the post was despite the evidence scientists will simply dismiss it its not oh well we should look at our dating methods its like we have to reevaluate how fossilization occurs oh we know this is 80 million years old because of the layer huh so after knocking down your straw man how do explain her discovery
6169055 the rocks turned out to be ancient burial stones that the inca indians placed with their dead almost one third of the stones depicted specific types of dinosaurs such as triceratops and stegosaurus and various pterosaurs the type of art form represented by these stones and their location dated them to the time of the inca culture c a d 500 1500 how could these ancient indians have known the anatomy of these creatures if they never had witnessed them firsthand
6169056 interestingly several diplodocus like dinosaurs on the stones have what appear to be dermal frills something never previously reported by scientists
6169057 also the skin of many of the carved dinosaurs resembled bumpy rosettes
6169058 again we must ask how could the incas have drawn such accurate pictures of dinosaurs if they never had seen the animals or had them described by someone who had seen them
6169059 see above in other words why are you so easily dismissing them as mere mythical creatures as i keep saying believe in this stuff and you must also believe in the hydra
6169060 yeah right if its one thing that a scientist wants is the respect of his peers
6169061 there is no evidence against evolution thats not my view in the slightest i simply dont take adaptation and mutation to be evidence for it
6169062 dinosaur soft tissue sequenced similar to chicken proteins http news nationalgeographic com news 2007 04 070412 dino tissues 2 html now look at that now is it so easy to dismiss finding soft tissue in dinosaur bones if you believe that it supports your belief well no you probably believe that birds are descended from dinosaurs thus it proves true
6169063 to me it seems still that while it can prove the 2 may have been related i still simply dont believe soft tissue could survive 65 million years
6169064 on another note though i be a creationist i am not a new earther
6169065 i action media pg lions on of childcare lions by dvd
6169066 the sustainability of new zealands existing port sector investments the industrys ability to invest in the future and the global competitiveness of the countrys supply chain might be assisted by the purchase of port of taurangas container business by ports of auckland
6169067 port of tauranga has always held the view that a full merger of port of tauranga and ports of auckland makes very good sense that view has not changed
6169068 the perception was at the time that there was very strong commercial sense in a transaction
6169069 it may be in the interests of both companies to focus on their core strengths for ports of auckland to optimise the investment in the container business for the upper north island and for port of tauranga to obtain a better return on capital through divesting its container business

6169071 it was a hoot and i dont propose to release the one i have for mr rudd
6169072 i think it was a pretty minor thing i had a bit of a laugh im not offended i thought it was quite funny
6169073 eventually as the commonwealth stuck to its guns and charter and the harare declaration mr mugabe left rather than face his peers and determined to get on a better course now one hopes fiji sees the sense in sticking to its promise to the forum
6169074 i have no doubt at all that the ministerial contact group report will be supported people are very frustrated they feel the least bainimarama could have done is come to niue and explain himself and he hasnt done that
6169075 i think its one of those things we want to seek everybodys view and take a stand that maintains the strength and relevance of the forum as an international body no one wants to see a member being suspended or expelled you have got to explore other ways of moving forward if there arent then i guess thats the next step we will have to look at
6169076 i am entitled to do what i like with my money
6169077 mr henry paid the money to ensure the bill was paid in time and he was later reimbursed by myself
6169078 he checked his records yesterday and found this was indeed the case
6169079 it was more like the spanish inquisition or the salem witch trials than a reasoned hearing by the so called highest court in the land
6169080 it would not have surprised me to have seen a gallows being erected or a stake with piles of dry wood stacked around it
6169081 so how then could winston have reimbursed henry for the 40 000 when he didnt even know that henry had paid the bill for him
6169082 the u s was not involved in that raid it was an element of one of the iraqi special operations forces do we support it in principle absolutely not
6169083 it was what appears to be a rogue operation its definitely concerning that we have an element that would go do something like that

6169090 these commodities are very much currency plays at the moment
6169091 nosotros venimos de una situaci n en la que produc amos 5 000 kilogramos de grano por hect rea mientras que en la actualidad producimos de 10 a 12 000 kilogramos por hect rea
6169092 de manera que hemos duplicado la productividad en 10 a os
6169093 tenemos m s chinos comiendo m s indios comiendo m s africanos comiendo y m s brasile os comiendo
6169094 todo esto es tratado por la prensa como si fuera una crisis y se le vende al mundo como si fuera una crisis
6169095 sin ninguna arrogancia o autoimportancia los brasile os necesitamos tomar lo que para otros es una crisis como una extraordinaria oportunidad de transformarnos realmente nosotros mismos en el granero del mundo como mucha gente desde hace mucho tiempo pronostic
6169096 sin duda alguna hay potencial para producir si el gobierno no se atraviesa en el camino
6169097 nosotros ni siquiera vamos a pronunciar la palabra ayuda si el gobierno no pone obst culos a o tras a o generalmente el productor est incrementando la producci n
6169098 si nos referimos a la parte central de brasil todav a hay much simas reas no explotadas por eso no tengo dudas
6169099 lo que hemos visto en los diez ltimos a os es una revoluci n silenciosa en nuestro pa s principalmente en la producci n agroindustrial
6169100 venimos de ser un participante irrelevante del mercado internacional a ser uno de los mayores abastecedores mundiales de alimentos y biocarburantes
6169101 si usted mira lo que le ocurri a nuestra agricultura en t rminos de exportaciones de carne de ganado o de pollo de nuevo ramos irrelevantes y ahora tenemos la posici n del exportador de alimentos m s grande del mundo
6169102 el impacto emerger con m s intensidad dentro de 20 o 30 a os y hasta entonces deber amos estar prepar ndonos para ello
6169103 la perspectiva por el momento para las futuras cosechas es muy productiva por lo tanto brasil tiene el potencial para seguir creciendo alrededor del 5 al 6 anual en t rminos de aumento de las cosechas vamos a mantener de manera eficaz este ritmo en los pr ximos a os sin ning n problema
6169104 no estamos contra la expansi n de la capacidad del pa s de producir alimentos ni en contra de ayudar al desarrollo de brasil
6169105 usted puede aumentar la capacidad de producci n de alimentos con tecnolog a mejores pr cticas ocupando reas que ya est n degradadas invirtiendo en mejores cosechas
6169106 pero usted no puede aumentar su productividad a costa del medio ambiente porque el mercado global no acepta m s este precio
6169107 si tenemos el adecuado flujo de inversiones para la log stica la infraestructura la tecnolog a y el desarrollo de la tierra el pa s puede aumentar dos y medio hasta tres veces su producci n real en los pr ximos diez a os

6169167 i was training as hard as i could and while my diet was healthy i figured that nutrition might be the key
6169168 so i went to a sports nutrition seminar afterwards i collared the speaker kerry kayes and we chatted about my injuries he went through my diet and said i wasnt getting enough protein it made sense so i started taking protein supplements that was the turning point
6169169 the trauma that modern triathletes put their bodies through is immense
6169170 that calls for extra protein to help muscles repair themselves to get enough extra protein from an ordinary diet would mean eating huge amounts of food and having to deal with subsequent weight issues a good protein supplement delivers the protein in a low calorie easily digested formula that gives the body what it needs when it needs it
6169171 i tend to go back to certain races each year to gauge my level of fitness
6169172 at wetherby in 2007 i came sixth with an overall time of two hours eight minutes this year in much worse conditions i came third in two hours three minutes
6169173 typically in the past id take around 25 minutes for a 1500 metre swim ive shaved at least two minutes off that this year
6169174 its the best job i could be doing i get to train every day while other people are at work and i can keep a close eye on my diet too
6169175 i live nine miles from the fire station so i run or bike in every day
6169176 theres no doubt that kerrys protein supplements have made all the difference this year
6169177 my performance has improved and im really enjoying competing theyre very easy to drink too absolutely spot on

6169180 this denial of the historical spiritual and archeological connections of the jews to the temple mount is something new
6169181 there was always talk about the temple of solomon in jerusalem called the praise of jerusalem in arabic literature in islamic literature
6169182 in the washington dc think tanks surrounding president bill clinton it was understood that the temple mount was the crux of the problem of the middle east conflict
6169183 its a brilliant idea an excellent idea but totally idiotic from a practical point of view you cannot have a building standing with its foundations in another country you cannot have a building with the infrastructure and the plumbing in another country and you cannot have sovereignty on the subground without having accessibility to the subground because the accessibility is from above ground the whole thing was stupid
6169184 filled with earth which is saturated with very valuable archeological materials enormous damage was done in these works which were carried out mainly from 1996 and onward the idea that came from the circles surrounding bill clinton and leaked to the wakf authorities is what generated the illicit building activities i wouldnt call them excavations but destructive work which was carried out brutally on the temple mount the fear the fear of anything representing a jewish presence on the temple mount drove them mad

6169325 acreditamos de forma provis ria que h significativos problemas de competi o advindos da propriedade concentrada de sete aeroportos brit nicos pela baa
6169326 isso evidente pelo grande n mero de fatores que incluem a falta de aten o s necessidades das empresas a reas suas clientes e a falta de iniciativa no planejamento de capacidade dos aeroportos
6169327 a avalia o da cc deve ser analisada luz da urgente necessidade de mais capacidade em aeroportos e por uma estrutura regulat ria moderna assim como pela necessidade que reconhecemos de melhores servi os dos operadores de aeroportos
6169328 lembramos por m que esse n o o fim do processo da cc e que iremos continuar a apontar comiss o as v rias reas em que acreditamos sua an lise falha e que suas sugest es para remediar os problemas s o desproporcionais e contraproducentes
6169329 o controle monopolista da baa sobre os aeroportos de londres tem sido altamente prejudicial competi o e aos consumidores
6169330 stansted hoje o mais caro por uma margem consider vel dos mais de 150 aeroportos em que a ryanair opera em toda a europa
6169331 os planos da baa de desperdi ar mais 4 bilh es de libras em um segundo terminal e em uma segunda pista em stansted quando tais estruturas poderiam ser constru das por uma fra o desse custo evidencia ainda mais seu monop lio abusivo e vai levar a pre os ainda mais altos para os consumidores

6169337 i think in the current environment everyone is more cautious about investments
6169338 if and when a compelling opportunity came up in the us local space where we think were well suited wed have a look at that but wed be looking for a majority interest and control role
6169339 interest rates petrol prices and consumer sentiment will tend to affect the low end of the business more than the high end
6169340 i obviously know that at the end of the day that the owner has the final
6169341 this season has been filled with so many highs and lows the team has worked so hard and has done an incredible job with the race cars we fell out of the top 10 after watkins glen and now the goal is to get ourselves back up there in the points and make big guy proud
6169342 bristol has always been one of my favorite race tracks we had a strong car in the spring but the rain came and ended our day early were bringing the same car so hopefully well get that top 10 that eluded us the last time around

6169374 for the liberal party to try and blow a hole in that surplus is the height of economic irresponsibility
6169375 of course well talk with all of the senators but ultimately it will be on dr nelsons head if this measure is not supported and he needs to start explaining what the health impact will be if he stops this measure going ahead
6169376 its sad and i hope they can sort it out
6169377 im not in a position to confirm or deny that
6169378 its a personal matter and brett is working through that
6169379 the selectors are comfortable this move will maintain the competitive edge for the australian side and provide a wonderful opportunity for brett geeves to join the australian group for the first time
6169380 offers the clearest muslim option for reconciliation between the judeo christian and islamic worlds as well as fulfillment of the promise that islam shall be a religion of peace
6169381 that blowhard needs to close his yap or lose his job
6169382 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition i have not suggested it because i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
6169383 there are droughts in north and south carolina parts of california most of new zealand and this idiot who firmly believes he can induce rain by prayer is wasting it by asking his lord and savior to play a political prank its not boyish humor and youre a selfish hypocrite
6169384 the democratic vice presidential prick in 2000 who now is an independent
6169385 following the lead of political families like the strogers and lipinskis illinois senate president emil jones is anointing one of his children to take over for him when he retires in january
6169386 his preference yes would be to see his son serve
6169387 in rural minnesota one district is skipping classes every monday to save fuel nationwide at least 14 other districts are switching to four day weeks and dozens more are considering it

6169392 protester sheehan and public enemy coming to denver for dnc
6169393 a man being suspended in the air by six metal hooks clamped to his skin during an act at a tattoo convention fell and broke a leg
6169394 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6169395 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6169396 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6169397 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6169398 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6169399 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6169400 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
6169401 im asking a lot of the american people and i know that
6169402 my biography is not typical of a modern american president
6169403 is it doesnt have any real distinct tonality to it its pleasant to listen to its an voice
6169404 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6169405 with gas prices soaring barack obama says no to off shore drilling and says hell raise taxes on electricity higher taxes more foreign oil thats the real obama
6169406 this election cycle they are asking me to sound less like an announcer and more like a real person
6169407 it often feels like there is sort of more colloquial language like when i say things like is this really his plan
6169408 the sort of straight authoritarian announcer sometimes is still appropriate but a lot of times it will be noise or wallpaper to people
6169409 and i invented the remote control too another round of this and ill sell my television
6169410 i know theres no one who knows the subject matter that hes going to have to deal with better than john
6169411 his attitude toward the environment at pennfuture has been very angry
6169412 i think id characterize some of his views as extreme
6169413 theres no one i trust more than mary jo white in striking a balance
6169414 helped shape bills that were both tremendously positive for pennsylvania businesses and at the same time good for our environment
6169415 he starts off with some positives and starts off with a few negatives but i think he can work his way toward confirmation
6169416 i know exactly the difference between being an advocate in the private sector and having a public responsibility
6169417 whats important is working hard listening to everyone considering different views and trying to arrive at fair productive answers
6169418 view of economic development is through regulation litigation and taxation theyve supported so many taxes against our members i think the appointment is a concern for us
6169419 were certainly hopeful that the secretary designate despite the constituency he most recently represented will be able to shift gears and represent a broader constituency that includes us
6169420 all of these things are just incredibly expensive to the public while yielding almost no environmental benefit
6169421 if you cant compete with petroleum at 120 a barrel you cant compete
6169422 the whole concept of state government playing around in venture capital is nonsense
6169423 i think hes done an excellent job leading pennfuture and i think hell transfer all that experience and passion to his new position
6169424 well ah ah i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective
6169425 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
6169426 this is something that i have not i think come to a firm resolution on i think its very hard to know what that means when life begins is it when a cell separates is it when the soul stirs so i dont presume to know the answer to that question what i know as ive said before is that there is something extraordinarily powerful about potential life and that has a moral weight to it that we take into consideration when were having these debates
6169427 im not sure if there are human beings in there but go ahead and blow it up
6169428 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6169429 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6169430 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6169431 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6169432 take an active role to help secure a lasting settlement of the israeli palestinian conflict
6169433 its not enough for the next president to commit again to trying
6169434 to muster the political will for an intensive effort that brings the parties together hammers out their differences and brings about an agreement
6169435 bidens son is a lawyer who would be nowhere near the front lines
6169436 for mccains son it was either the army or jail thats why mccain rarely mentions he son in iraq
6169437 i didnt decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms i believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism in truth i wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to be president
6169438 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because her father is janet reno
6169439 they got as far as the elevators and they were overtaken theyre now in custody and theyll be under severe guard
6169440 a lot of companies are unaware of where their catalogue paper comes from
6169441 we want to work with them and pressure them to do the right thing by adopting sustainable policies
6169442 at first they werent responsive but then they saw how it would benefit them
6169443 consumer opinion has a lot of power to influence companies
6169444 we continue to work within the supply chain to promote certification of forests and fibre and we are engaged with our suppliers to continuously improve on our prudent use of natural resources
6169445 sears has yet to make any policy changes so well continue to lobby them
6169446 my phone has a charger you can find at the store too
6169447 i swear i use wm6 but then only stupid people would actually believe you
6169448 yeah your right but im going to say it in different words so it makes it seem like i know what im talking about
6169449 no single winmo smartphone has sold as many units in an equal period of time
6169450 those two facts alone show how the winmo platform is loosing its pre eminent mobile platform status
6169451 those two facts alone show how the winmo platform is loosing its pre eminent mobile smartphone platform status
6169452 the inability to highlight copy cut and paste is one example
6169453 now i have an iphone i can do more things than anyone thats has a wm device

6169456 was f r eine umerziehung durch arbeit soll bei ihr erreicht werden
6169457 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
6169458 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
6169459 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
6169460 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
6169461 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
6169462 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
6169463 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
6169464 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
6169465 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
6169466 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
6169467 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
6169468 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
6169469 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
6169470 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
6169471 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
6169472 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
6169473 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
6169474 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
6169475 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
6169476 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
6169477 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
6169478 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
6169479 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
6169480 u s efforts to change the strategic balance of power in its favor
6169481 the long range interceptor missiles to be deployed in poland do not have and in the foreseeable future will not have any target other than russian intercontinental ballistic missiles
6169482 it is clear to us and the u s leadership does not deny this that the u s anti missile defense in europe will be broadened and modernized in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic demarches
6169483 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
6169484 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
6169485 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
6169486 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
6169487 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
6169488 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
6169489 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
6169490 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
6169491 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6169492 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6169493 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6169494 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6169495 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6169496 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6169497 if you want real change you need to make our legally elected
6169498 foreclosure is often a lengthy costly and destructive process avoiding foreclosure not only strengthens local neighborhoods where foreclosures are already driving down property values it makes good business sense
6169499 by turning troubled loans into performing ones we enhance their overall value
6169500 its my hope that it will provide further catalyst to provide more loan modifications for borrowers across the country
6169501 can we really afford more of the same john mccains tax plan for big corporations 200 billion in new tax breaks oil companies 4 billion companies shipping jobs overseas keep their tax giveaways while 100 million americans get no tax relief at all for the change we need barack obama a plan that cuts taxes for middle class families three times as much as john mccain would barack obama president
6169502 he would like to cut the corporate tax rate and its a question that were studying
6169503 those in the top 1 percent would face a 19 000 or 1 5 percent reduction in after tax income
6169504 mccain would lift after tax incomes an average of about 3 percent or 1 400 annually for middle income taxpayers by 2012
6169505 but in sharp contrast to obama he would cut taxes for those in the top 1 percent by more than 125 000 raising their after tax income an average 9 5 percent
6169506 die unabh ngigkeit abchasiens muss anerkannt werden ein milit rvertrag muss unterschrieben werden doch das wichtigste haben wir bereits vom russischen pr sidenten erfahren russland bleibt im kaukasus die meinung des westens ist uns ehrlich gesagt wurscht
6169507 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
6169508 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
6169509 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
6169510 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
6169511 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
6169512 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
6169513 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
6169514 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
6169515 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
6169516 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
6169517 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
6169518 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
6169519 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
6169520 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
6169521 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
6169522 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
6169523 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
6169524 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
6169525 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
6169526 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
6169527 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6169528 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
6169529 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
6169530 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
6169531 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
6169532 das wird die zeit zeigen es h ngt davon ab wie sich der politische prozess entwickelt
6169533 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
6169534 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
6169535 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
6169536 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
6169537 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6169538 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6169539 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
6169540 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
6169541 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
6169542 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
6169543 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
6169544 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
6169545 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
6169546 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
6169547 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
6169548 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
6169549 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
6169550 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
6169551 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
6169552 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
6169553 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
6169554 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
6169555 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
6169556 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6169557 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
6169558 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
6169559 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
6169560 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
6169561 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
6169562 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
6169563 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
6169564 gegen die neuen bedrohungen des 21 jahrhunderts gegen langstreckenraketen aus l ndern wie dem iran oder nordkorea
6169565 ich finde russland sollte wirklich ber gegenschritte nachdenken um gegen seine umzingelung vorzugehen
6169566 launching your dreams a practical guide to starting a business and getting funded
6169567 i dont think its going to happen soon but then again i thought it was going to take longer than it did for us to get where we are today theres still a lot of work to be done but seeing mixed martial arts in the olympics would be incredible
6169568 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6169569 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6169570 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6169571 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6169572 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6169573 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
6169574 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
6169575 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
6169576 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
6169577 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
6169578 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
6169579 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
6169580 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
6169581 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
6169582 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
6169583 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
6169584 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
6169585 the guy came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6169586 we want to play the defending champs its all about challenges
6169587 obviously we welcome all comers and we know what a great team greece is but argentina theyre the defending champs you want to be able to play the guys who won it last time
6169588 we know theyre by far the best team we know well have to play a perfect game and thats probably not enough theyll have to play badly
6169589 hes the one guy on our team thats not afraid to take the final shot or guard anyone
6169590 kobe is the no 1 athlete out here beyond basketball i think people are starting to see his personality
6169591 so were just going to continue to apply pressure for 48 minutes and try to wear you down
6169592 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6169593 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6169594 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6169595 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6169596 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6169597 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6169598 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6169599 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
6169600 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
6169601 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6169602 they told me there are going to be resources here
6169603 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6169604 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6169605 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6169606 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6169607 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6169608 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6169609 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6169610 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6169611 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
6169612 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
6169613 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
6169614 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
6169615 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
6169616 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
6169617 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
6169618 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
6169619 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
6169620 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
6169621 it became a spoof of those calendars that you find in garages all over the place where you see hot women posing in front of cars
6169622 you would never expect to see that with a forklift in the background it becomes humorous above everything else
6169623 customize your forklift create the baddest lift on the warehouse floor for your chance to win monthly prizes
6169624 weve been featured in newspapers on tv and online from the netherlands united arab emirates and australia here in canada weve been featured in two national newspapers and two national television outlets i would estimate that about 90 percent of web visitors learned about pimpmylift from press coverage
6169625 ive always had this mantra that the best way to get new business is to focus on existing business
6169626 were in the business of coming up with new ideas
6169627 its always good to have someone on the inside of a company cultivated as a source who can be your eyes and ears about whats going on
6169628 we reinforce the idea that backbones service is something they can count on and when they are in their new position and have evaluated their needs they can give me a call
6169629 you should go in with fairly modest expectations and inquire about what theyd be willing to do based on your relationship
6169630 even if there isnt a need it shows that youre mindful of this former customer
6169631 it also sends a good signal that the relationship is not over
6169632 kay do condominiums have any pet rules my neighbors on each side have dogs im disgusted with the messes they are constantly making in my front yard i have to clean them up
6169633 a sup erb integration of academic and leadership skills a strong sense of personal identity and a sound understanding of global ethics
6169634 there is no virtue in that kind of talk and it should always be discouraged my appeal even then was that responsibility is a significant message but our needs require real government intervention and private sector incentives to address the issues such as unemployment building affordable housing and making educa tion even more affordable which really was my point it was a very painful period for me to have gone through that
6169635 hes free to express himself and it does not bother our relationship as father and son at all he was taught to give his opinion in our house hold and he did it in love hes tough hes smart he has a future in politics he didnt want the impression to be that that my faux pas was his faux pas because it is not i respect his right to express himself
6169636 i think we have an outstanding candidate we have the burden now to fully register and vote there are still maybe six to eight million blacks unregistered who should not miss this hour this opportunity now that we have a who lets focus on the what
6169637 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6169638 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6169639 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6169640 weve got a lot of delegates inspired by the candidate
6169641 many are issue oriented many are generally inspired all carry the same we need change theme
6169642 we had 880 000 democrats vote in the primary thats 280 000 more than before
6169643 goes from college students to senior citizens its a very diverse group some are doing it for the first time
6169644 im fortunate that the first time im going im going to witness history
6169645 we really have a good cross section of people going it says a lot there were a lot of new and young voters in the primary and we dont want to lose them in november we want to keep them engaged
6169646 i think people are ready for change to turn this economy around to end this war
6169647 conjugan el nacimiento de una nueva institucionalidad que pone en primer orden la participaci n del pueblo
6169648 las misiones tambi n nos han permitido tener un gobierno mucho m s eficiente y eficaz porque hemos trabajado en tiempo y espacio con mucha m s rapidez que con las formas tradicionales que desde las instituciones del estado se viene haciendo
6169649 esperamos la aprobaci n definitiva del ministerio de salud para anunciar la puesta en marcha del banco de tejidos y el inicio del programa cardiaco pedi trico
6169650 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
6169651 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
6169652 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
6169653 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
6169654 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
6169655 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
6169656 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
6169657 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
6169658 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
6169659 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
6169660 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
6169661 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6169662 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
6169663 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
6169664 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6169665 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6169666 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6169667 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6169668 the most technically advanced container port in the world integrated with europes largest logistics park

6169671 we began the dynamic testing of the pipeline wednesday this is a test that needs to be done before full operation
6169672 as you would expect we have been in communication with the companies for months to receive updates weve also been communicating with their regulator and the federal reserve
6169673 which of the following statements about the national archives nara do you agree with
6169674 which of naras activities do you most want to know more about
6169675 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
6169676 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
6169677 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
6169678 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
6169679 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
6169680 information on the number of people involved is not yet available but spanair is doing everything possible to help the spanish authorities at this difficult time
6169681 sas is doing everything possible to help passengers and next of kin and to assist spanish authorities
6169682 boeing extends its deep condolences to the families and friends of those lost in the crash of spanair 5022 in madrid and our hope for the speedy recovery of the injured

6169687 rusia se retrage de pe teritoriul georgian dar trebuie sa intensifice ritmul
6169688 they will dictate political fortunes and reshape the government of this country at all levels anyone who wants to understand the political landscape must examine the mind and motivations of the womens electorate
6169689 year after year one thing has become clear when women vote women and democrats win
6169690 thats why this study is so important to understanding the messages and issues that will motivate this critical segment of the electorate
6169691 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6169692 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6169693 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6169694 its not a head fake apparently its a serious float
6169695 mccains trying to gauge take the temperature of delegates to the convention and these high donors this is tough because i like joe lieberman a lot hes a fine guy
6169696 the convention would be roiled there would be a walkout
6169697 mccain wants a vice presidential pal thats why he is looking at ridge and lieberman
6169698 well see if his staff can explain the political consequences to him
6169699 i cant imagine the people around mccain are this dumb but they might be a bunch of yes men
6169700 but if he picks a pro choice running mate its not going to be pretty
6169701 john mccain is the campaigns one spokesperson on the vice presidential selection process
6169702 we wont be discussing any potential nominees or that process
6169703 on 85 percent of the issues joe lieberman is clearly from the more liberal side of life
6169704 i dont think he is necessarily a winning partner for john mccain
6169705 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6169706 if only this picture had been published before the 2000 election gore would be president
6169707 the hardest thing for a first time candidate to do unless hes already particularly well known in the community for something hes done is to build name id
6169708 dont have to go through the months and months and months of introducing themselves to voters
6169709 an important thing to realize i think is that youre not starting necessarily from where you finished last cycle
6169710 the mistake a candidate can make who got very close last cycle is to assume they start at that point and all they need to do is make up for the 1 000 votes or the 3 000 votes or whatever it is theyre short
6169711 it might be easier to start off with a blank slate than to start off with a guy whos got very high negatives
6169712 theres nothing that will teach you to deal with the media better than dealing with the media you learn that its a bleeping hot stove and it will burn you if you put your hand on it
6169713 the issue matrix is so different this time around and i believe it certainly plays to my strength
6169714 last time kagen ran against the establishment and now he is the establishment
6169715 its kind of like a team that made it to the super bowl and loses but they have that experience of going very far and the next time theyre going to win it
6169716 it was an absolutely fabulous night for our statewide candidates
6169717 they all outperformed what our expectations could have been dino first and foremost
6169718 the roman catholic church which was supposed to carry the light of the gospel plunged the world into the dark ages
6169719 john paul ii will be remembered for staring down communism and embracing people of all faiths and colors
6169720 im not going to go to that convention the republican convention and spend my time attacking barack obama
6169721 im going to go there really talking about why i support john mccain and why i hope a lot of other independents and democrats will do that and frankly im going to go to a partisan convention and tell them if i go why its so important that we start to act like americans and not as partisan mudslingers here in washington
6169722 the repubs dont want him and neither will the democrats
6169723 im not going to go to that convention the republican convention and spend my time attacking barack obama
6169724 i would just like to take a moment after being seriously sickened by reading about georgia russia and poland and personally thank all the hillary supporters voting for mccain being an ex republican i am absolutely disgusted with the direction this country is going but i have come to the realization that a country like ours is only as good as those people who are willing to be civically responsible so thank you puma and clinton mccain backers for the onslaught on ww iii economic depression and marshall law i realize of course that i am a bit premature in my gratitude but i have every confidence if any ignorant selfish people could pull off completely destroying this country and democracy it will be you hats off to the misguided uniformed and just dont give a darn population putin iran and osama are counting on you
6169725 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6169726 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6169727 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6169728 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6169729 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6169730 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6169731 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6169732 you cant implificate me this time im up to my floppy ears in afghanistan trying to pacificate those presidentless folks over there
6169733 shoot i concoctified katrina to guarantee me one more term in office i did not have sex with that woman ms nature im still experimentating on a secret mass amnesia event that will allow me to sorta reintroducify myself as the next american messiah that way i can get reelected all over gain for the first time ive codenamed the project operation forget me not no wait operation forget me no wait oh just forget it
6169734 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
6169735 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
6169736 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
6169737 sometimes when the team is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys tell them to go out there with all theyve got and win just one for the gipper
6169738 in a world of manu fake ture and low cost imitators the only sustainable strategy for leadership is the maverick approach to brand building that means having the courage to step outside ones comfort zone and go against the grain
6169739 do we really want all of our traffic all of our editorial control of the internet all being piped through one two or three companies
6169740 to stand out you have to create a unique voice
6169741 trying to make excuses or to yell about my articles
6169742 americans end up getting bad information and supporting bad decisions and strategies
6169743 i think when you get so distant from the facts as as guys like limbaugh and sean hannity do yeah i think that tends to corrupt the dialogue
6169744 defend and explain one example where i said something that was so false
6169745 youre not listening susan youve got to learn something he saddam had weapons of mass destruction he promised to disclose them and he didnt do it you would have let him go free we decided to hold him accountable
6169746 and kay had also not discovered any chemical or biological weapons
6169747 colin powell just had a great piece that he had in the paper today he was there in iraq he said things couldnt have been better
6169748 iraq has come very far but serious problems remain starting with security american commanders and troops told me of the many threats they face from leftover loyalists who want to return iraq to the dark days of saddam from criminals who were set loose on iraqi society when saddam emptied the jails and increasingly from outside terrorists who have come to iraq to open a new front in their campaign against the civilized world
6169749 and in northern iraq today this very day al qaeda is operating camps there and they are attacking the kurds in the north and this has been well documented and well chronicled now if youre going to go after al qaeda in every aspect and obviously they have the support of saddam or were not
6169750 kay also called a speech where cheney made the claim there was a link to al qaeda
6169751 after 9 11 liberal democrats at first showed little interest in the investigation of the roots of this massive intelligence failure bush and his team made it clear that determining the causes of americas security failures and finding and remedying its weak points would be central to their mission
6169752 president bush took a few minutes during his trip to europe thursday to voice his opposition to establishing a special commission to probe how the government dealt with terror warnings before sept 11
6169753 first of all this president you know and i know and everybody knows inherited a recession it was by every definition a recession
6169754 the recession officially began in 2001 months after bush was sworn in according to the universally acknowledged arbiter of such things the national bureau of economic research and president bush at other times has also said so himself
6169755 the hispanic community got to know him bush in texas they went almost overwhelming for him he more than quadrupled the hispanic vote that he got in that state
6169756 look weve had these reports very disturbing reports and i have actually spoken to people that have confirmed a lot of the reports about the trashing of the white house when the clintons left the white house pornographic materials left in the printers they cut the phone lines lewd and crude messages on phone machines stripping of anything that was not bolted down on air force one 200 000 in furniture taken out
6169757 is it you hate this president or that you hate america
6169758 governor why wouldnt anyone want to say the pledge of allegiance unless they detested their own country or were ignorant of its greatness
6169759 you could explain something about your magazine the nation lisa featherstone writing about the hate america march the anti war march that took place over the weekend
6169760 i hate america this is the extreme left there is a portion of the left not everybody whos left that does hate this country and blame this country for the ills of the world
6169761 you dont like this country do you you think this is an evil country by your description of it right here you think its a bad country
6169762 it doesnt say anywhere in the constitution this idea of the separation of church and state
6169763 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
6169764 the senators and representatives before mentioned and the members of the several state legislatures and all executive and judicial officers both of the united states and of the several states shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this constitution but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the united states
6169765 you want to refer to some liberal activist judge thats fine but im going to go directly to the source the author of the bill of rights james madison hired the first chaplain in 1789 and i gotta tell ya somethin i think the author of the bill of rights knows more about the original intent no offense to you and your liberal atheist activism knows more about it than you do

6169948 but what about your sister drago youve let her go
6169949 stop talking about this please it is the only thing in the world that makes me sad the doctors say i must be positive and to allow only happy thoughts to cross my brain
6169950 if she doesnt come back i will be allowed to go home isnt that nice

6169963 and then it begins to say i think rescue me but letters are missing
6169964 do winters in serbia come with a lot of you know water that isnt wet what do you call it
6169965 its not hard or soft but it can be both and it never falls in summer and you need it for certain sports and i cant think about winter properly without knowing the name of that stuff why cant i isnt that funny why should it matter theres got to be more to winter than that stuff that isnt really any colour i can think of whats the name of it got to do with oh you know the time when everyone comes over and gives um boxes

6169976 they are both being held in a russian jail awaiting trial theres nothing to be done about it im really very sorry
6169977 the complicating factor here is that without her consent your release from his institution can only be secured by the doctors treating you you are drago utterly at the mercy of the system and the system is quite badly broken in todays quebec im afraid
