7380000 these short cycles demand a radical change in thinking in the development of large hardware bound systems it requires the ability to deliver every two weeks or monthly and so requires rethinking of the whole system how we plan and how we estimate the costs of the development another crucial element is technological requiring investment but the benefits are quite clear
7380001 we showed we could actually achieve up to 70 reduction in lead time and costs

7380004 we have been able to go beyond what is being done in the usa currently putting europe ahead and while development teams in india and other countries have now set up their own technologies in this area europe has a competitive edge that should last several years
7380005 we are expecting the sample to look similar to previous samples

7380021 it seemed to me partly cautious and partly lack of interest but strong opinions were just not stated
7380022 oh sure hardly a day goes by that somebody doesnt take a belt at the russians
7380023 nobody can find fault with you if you take out after the russians
7380024 you think then we might be using russians as an outlet for something else other things
7380025 why i remember when people took everything out on mr roosevelt
7380026 it seemed to me that the frantic bustle of america was not in montana
7380027 it was only as i approached seattle that the unbelievable change became apparent

7380038 we urge china to take positive steps to address international and domestic concerns about its record on human rights and religious freedoms
7380039 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of 10 tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games
7380040 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7380041 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7380042 these laws will give the commonwealth government power to suspend welfare payments if people dont have their children enrolled and regularly attending school
7380043 but theres no excuse for not having children regularly attending school
7380044 if children are to benefit from education if they are to get the best start in life then they must be enrolled in and regularly attending school
7380045 we want to fix that statistic were concerned about it
7380046 there is evidence that at least 2 000 children are not even enrolled to go to school in the northern territory
7380047 suspending a parents welfare payment will be a last resort
7380048 we know that teachers and principals at the moment work very hard with their families to try and get their children attending on a regular basis
7380049 not getting a win all year and getting all of those seconds was killing him so im really happy for him to win the race he was the quickest car out there today its just great for the team

7380065 they built it up more theyre further ahead on resource development and they also have the largest ice breaking fleet
7380066 theyre ahead of the game on the submissions for the law of the sea
7380067 the longer they stay out the longer the russians are able to consolidate their position to their advantage
7380068 rocs operational and financial results for the half year have been somewhat overshadowed by the decline in the companys share price since the announcement of the proposed anzon takeover mr clement said
7380069 if successful roc will more than double its 2p reserves and increase its forecast production in 2010 to over 20 000 boepd barrels of oil equivalent per day
7380070 the takeover will immediately increase operating cash flow for the company by up to 50 per cent and expose roc to significant upside reserves potential from the development of the basker manta gummy project in bass strait over the next 18 months a corker too dear to drink
7380071 on the back of that we saw some other currencies fall such as the euro and the australian dollar

7380073 a stronger us dollar weaker gold theme has seen the aussie dollar retrace below the 0 8650 level
7380074 gold fell on the stronger us dollar and commodity currencies like the aussie have fallen on the back of that

7380083 it is crippling for family members to lose a loved one in such violent circumstances
7380084 it is my hope that this reward will encourage somebody out there with information about this case to come forward and help us provide justice for the boyd family
7380085 often it takes just one small bit of information to help put the missing pieces into place so i would encourage anybody not matter how insignificant they might think it is to come forward and share with us what they know
7380086 they have the option of getting free independent legal advice
7380087 its an independent bunch of lawyers that telstra has arranged they are experts in the field and will give independent help with interpretations of the clauses of the offer
7380088 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts
7380089 the company aims to hold workers pay to below the rate of inflation effectively cutting its wages bill by almost 15 per cent over four years
7380090 for the average technician this would amount to a cut in real wages over time of 7 300 a year
7380091 telstra is a prime example of big employers who are behaving badly towards their staff and thumbing their nose at the rudd governments cooperative industrial relations policy
7380092 we expect to see new laws introduced into the parliament very soon to scrap all of work choices and replace it with a fair and balanced industrial relations system
7380093 we have taken the extra step of talking to wholesale employees about whats important to them and that will be reflected in any proposed agreement
7380094 of course our employees will be able to vote on any proposed agreement
7380095 for the first time many employees may have the opportunity to earn extra money through good performance
7380096 something that stood out about him was his willingness to help
7380097 he was so personable with the families who were waiting in line for supplies
7380098 there was a long line and it was hot but he still managed to make them laugh and have fun
7380099 it is nice to be on the other side of the law
7380100 its good to be doing a positive action instead of defending myself in court for bad actions its good to know that my actions are helping someone else
7380101 its a great opportunity to give back to someone who has given so much to our community
7380102 police officers go through so much to protect our communities they put themselves in the front line even though they get paid theres much more they do that goes beyond the paycheck
7380103 his daily rehab bill has to be very costly and the traveling expense and meals must be tremendous
7380104 to have this happen all of a sudden i just cant imagine people come to us at the mission all the time in crisis situations and now that his family is in one we are delighted to be able to do that for them
7380105 i talked to the power company here this morning took a while for them to go back and find it but apparently there was a 10 minute delay the day the icon was stolen
7380106 yeah thats why they couldnt find it right away now what
7380107 ive got a really important meeting that ive got to get back to so can you call me back
7380108 good listen george this little shindig youre having with the orthodox is there some kind of committee overseeing it
7380109 yes several of the bishops are on it but cant this wait until
7380110 i saw where bishop chanes staying with you but wouldnt happen to know where his people are staying would you i have to get in touch with naughton
7380111 how did you know bishop chane was on the committee
7380112 weve got to dot some is and cross some ts
7380113 any friend of mr prices is a friend of mine
7380114 i didnt expect to see you out and about so soon
7380115 this afternoon dont do it much anymore but i like to keep a hand in you never know
7380116 as a matter of fact we have done business the man wanted to engage the ship to transport a rather small object to valley park wouldnt say what it was hes supposed to contact me shortly before we shove off
7380117 ah kids im getting too old chris sometimes i forget their innocent laughs their trusting natures
7380118 anyway if youve got someplace to go dont bother waiting around for him
7380119 some folks there want to cross the pond in style and theyre paying top pound for the privilege i figure well take the iceland greenland newfoundland route give em something to look at
7380120 ive heard that can be a pretty rough stretch this time of year what with the icebergs and such
7380121 icebergs why in the world should i care about icebergs the fornow iii is literally unsinkable what could possibly go wrong
7380122 you got me just telling you what i heard thanks captain and have a safe trip
7380123 over in the corner the guy in the blue shirt 1 00 john michael
7380124 mr johnson that was amazing what you did i cant thank you enough
7380125 could i possibly um get a you know a um autograph
7380126 see that guy in the blue shirt over there in the corner devouring that pork tenderloin take him over a 1993 chateau jeffersonian and put it on my tab point me out if he asks after you give him the bottle hand him the envelope
7380127 take care of his bill will you this guys got enough on his rap sheet i dont want to add theft
7380128 my god you wouldnt believe how much porn this guy ordered
7380129 bishop smith said that the meeting is private and that i was not to tell you where it was mr johnson
7380130 this is mr zachary frey of the welbornian institution the department of religious investigation and the counter ecclesiastical terrorism unit
7380131 did george tell you not to tell him because if he did both you and he are going to have some serious explaining to do to a parade of government investigators beginning next weekish
7380132 look im not even an episcopalian im a missionary baptist
7380133 i think these people are as apostate as you do im just a temp trying to find a full time job promise youll leave me out of it
7380134 you are your friend are going to have to leave immediately or im alerting the authorities
7380135 we are the authorities george could you be so kind as to shut that door
7380136 anyhoo frank ive got an answer for that little problem of yours
7380137 john if i were you id stick georges other sock in it now what were you guys arguing about
7380138 a member of the committee and one of my staff isnt here hes not answering his phone and we dont know where he is
7380139 ill make this quick the rev john michael is not an iranian anglican john
7380140 hes currently on his way back to tehran at least i hope he is since i told him that if he tried to escape hed be put on a plane for baghdad and considering all the iraqis hes arranged to have murdered hed be dead before he hit the tarmac
7380141 so this john according to esfandianis e mails in the interest of interfaith understanding you volunteered your dioceses services to help iran in any way that you could and it made you no never mind that they told you they were sending someone from state security
7380142 you dont blow his cover and when he gets wind of the vladimir and tells you his plans you go along and when he gets wind of the vladimir coming to st louis and tells you he wants to steal it youre down youve got no patience with the orthodox anyway
7380143 so you get on the committee and feed esfandiani everything he needs to know esfandiani brings everything off naughton removes the icon and everything is copacetic almost
7380144 north south east and west are not the only directions you can take something around here
7380145 since the city of st louis is built over hundreds of miles of caves at least two of which pass directly under the cathedral that would provide more than enough space for jim to store the icon leave his prints on its container leave and plan on sending someone back for the icon later
7380146 the problem was that some security guard looked inside saw that the icon was missing and reported it this room was closed off and the only access to the icon was blocked off you and your little iranian friend are screwed john
7380147 all i had to do was change the combination on the lock without you knowing it then i went down there secured the icon fingerprinted it and put it on a plane for moscow my wifes going to have to do some serious diplomatic tap dancing but shes up to it she wont be all that happy about it john trust me on this
7380148 but i can keep the feds poking around your offices and asking a lot of uncomfortable questions for a long time john believe me
7380149 i was just hoping for a little gunplay a little danger you know
7380150 ill see what i can do for you next time kid
7380151 uh huh the icon should be back in moscow as im telling you this
7380152 incredible job baby so when can i expect you back here
7380153 you can keep this quiet why would i need to go back there
7380154 chris the doctors all said that you need to stay off that leg
7380155 okay okay ill get back as soon as bzzzzzzzzzzt and ill be bzzzzzzzzzzt oh for crying out bzzzzzzzzzzt the signals dying bzzzzzzzzzzt
7380156 dude the president of the united states you are going to pay for that one bro dearly

7380174 jongens als we nu eens allemaal terugkijken op ons leven tot zover is dit het dan gaan we zo door tot ons tigste
7380175 nou bijna allemaal huisje boompje beestje maarre zijn we gelukkig twijfelen we nooit aan de beslissingen die genomen zijn
7380176 het leven is wat je gebeurt terwijl je andere plannen maakt
7380177 nu ben ik niet van plan zelfmoord te plegen hoor
7380178 ik bedoel wat is nu de waarde van het leven
7380179 ieder mens zou een keer radicale periode in zijn leven moeten doormaken iets waardoor je het gevoel krijgt dat je echt leeft
7380180 wat jij dan nu wat je voor de rest van je leven zou willen
7380181 de te nemen acties liggen bij jou maar uiteindelijk komt alles altijd goed
7380182 ik schaam me voor mezelf en ik wil me verontschuldigen
7380183 ik heb de afgelopen twee jaar maar de helft van het water kunnen vervoeren die barst in mij zorgt ervoor dat het water er onderweg zo uit me loopt door mijn zwakheid zorg ik ervoor dat jij je werk niet goed kan doen
7380184 als we teruglopen naar het huis wil ik graag dat je let op de mooie bloemen langs het pad
7380185 heb je wel gezien dat er alleen bloemen aan jouw kant van het pad staan en niet aan de andere kant dat komt omdat ik altijd heb geweten van jouw gebrek en ik heb er mijn voordeel mee gedaan ik heb bloemen aan jouw kant van het pad gezaaid en elke dag begoot jij die bloemen als we van de rivier naar huis liepen al twee jaar lang heb ik bloemen kunnen plukken en in het huis van mijn meester kunnen zetten als jij niet gewoon geweest was zoals je bent had mijn meester geen schoonheid in huis gehad
7380186 oh shes just so crazy about him she thinks all his food is great
7380187 an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7380188 i know him very well and i know he has been on the front lines of the fight for social and economic justice his entire time in public service
7380189 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7380190 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else
7380191 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7380192 i have always seen stussy as the ralph lauren of street fashion its one of the classic pillar brands
7380193 this was a great opportunity to show the history of stussy in a new light its done with our mentality for a new tribe of inspired young minds and empowered artistic individuals here in here in our city and the entire world stussy always knows who to work with a reason theyve stayed relevant all these years so we feel really honored to be presenting this
7380194 the president continues to talk about the war on terror that is simply wrong
7380195 terrorism is a means not an end and very different groups and countries are using it toward very different goals if we cant even identify the enemy or describe the war were fighting its difficult to see how we will win
7380196 used to put in stuff like a resolution complimenting so and so and helping us in the global war on terror
7380197 its a dangerous notion it allows them under that rubric to include everything and it allows them to ignore other things
7380198 bidens staff has preferred other phrasing and there has not been a problem with that
7380199 would want to get whatever it was passed and they knew id be the bastard at the family picnic who wasnt afraid to take the heat being weak on terror id go in and rip them up
7380200 this political language has created a frame that is not accurate and that bush and his gang have used to justify anything they want to do
7380201 i think that the whole political establishment of both parties has been either confused or a little intimidated by the presidents jargon when he talks about terror
7380202 the war in chechnya is a war of liberation it engaged in terrorist activities but it it is fundamentally different
7380203 the reason why russian president vladimir putins gotten away with murder
7380204 the whole point here is that its kind of hard unless youve really spent a lot of time thinking about it to figure out exactly where you think americas place in the world is what its role is
7380205 and the next president ought to be at least as smart as his advisors
7380206 zomaar in het niets is ze er vandoor gegaan er was niets aan de hand ja ik kom de laatste tijd wat later thuis maar dat kan het niet zijn we hebben ook steeds vaker ruzie en zo dat komt omdat ik vind dat ze niet kan koken echt man het is niet meer te vreten slechter dan die ballen hier

7380227 any of the three defenders would address the teams overriding need for a transition specialist
7380228 hes still a player better used in a complementary role even the defense starved blue jackets desperate for someone with his transition skills couldnt trust him with first pairing minutes so its hard to imagine what upside the thrashers see that could justify making hainsey the teams second highest paid player trailing only ilya kovalchuk in laughs generated on the way to the bank hell be a serviceable defender but not an impact player and this is an impact player contract

7380305 there was a real determination in our play and a willingness to ask questions of the opposition
7380306 it was a good all round performance and once we got our noses in front there was only going to be one winner
7380307 i do not think any one of my players can hold their hands up and say they performed

7380322 bart for the most part was at the end of his career and all the packer fans knew it and knew that a transition was coming so i dont think it was as difficult as the situation with brett favre and aaron rodgers

7380324 i was more the bart starr type operator if you will that was going to back up in the pocket read the coverages and throw to the right guy so bart was the kind of guy i admired and emulated
7380325 plus id see bart in the off season when i was at alabama youd go to a banquet in birmingham and hed be there and id have a chance to talk with him

7380361 presidents illegal wiretapping program that allows intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on the conversations of americans without a judges approval or congressional authorization or oversight

7380385 the whole idea of a roll call vote could be in flux at this point
7380386 each person selected as a delegate shall sign a pledge that the person will continue to support at the national convention the candidate for president of the united states the person is selected as favoring until 2 convention nominating ballots have been taken

7380389 each delegate to the national convention shall use his best efforts at the convention for the partys presidential nominee candidate who received the greatest number of votes in the presidential preference election until the candidate is nominated for the office of president of the united states by the convention

7380391 delegates and alternates shall be bound to vote on the first ballot at the national convention for the candidate receiving the most votes in the primary
7380392 the delegates to the national conventions shall be bound by the results of the preferential presidential primary for the first two 2 ballots and shall vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged
7380393 this section reflects the legitimate interest of the state in insuring orderliness in the electoral process and it provides a means of presenting the political preferences of the people of this state to a political party
7380394 barack obama is too inexperienced too unqualified too untrustworthy and too dangerous to be potus
7380395 i think ob tells her to get her supporters in line or it wil be her fault
7380396 it really hit me hard when the campaign called and said she didnt want me to do it
7380397 people said if youre not going to do it were going to do it
7380398 they the clinton campaign said no but then they had to say no
7380399 but they also said we cant stop you if you want to do this
7380400 obama has been outspoken about contributions from lobbyists vowing not to accept any contributions from them biden doesnt seem to have quite the same view
7380401 i have done more than any other candidate in this race to take on lobbyists and won
7380402 they have not funded my campaign they will not run my white house and they will not drown out the voices of the american people when i am president
7380403 obama has been using the line about change in washington and changing the people in washington
7380404 highlights obamas lack of experience by picking joe biden with a 30 plus year history in washington
7380405 barack obama decries washington insiders and detests lobbyists but joe biden is the model washington insider
7380406 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7380407 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7380408 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7380409 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7380410 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7380411 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7380412 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure
7380413 we need somebody who talks tough whos going to act smart and be tough thats how were going to look after the safety of the american people
7380414 i dont think hes ready to be president and when youre commander in chief you shouldnt be having to select a mentor to help you with that role
7380415 under democratic party rules delegates are permitted to vote for whomever they want
7380416 some of us know what we are doing some dont some of us are ready to lead some arent some of us are right some are wrong
7380417 dont you understand i am doing this because i dont want to vote for mccain please do not force me to make this decision i want a democrat in the white house too but obama is not up to the job if you support hillary clinton like you say you do you will go and call her as soon as we hang up and tell her to sign the nomination petition you can also tell her that the puma group and all of the other resisters dont want to be forced by our party to vote for a republican
7380418 2 if obama is not elected in the general election he will never have any credibility in the democratic party again this is his one and only chance

7380677 weve seen that come through on the gold medal count its not something that were pleased with we certainly believe that our country is capable of winning the gold medal count
7380678 were succeeding in virtually every team sport that weve had here
7380679 we knew it would be difficult but we continued to invest resources in those sports its important to our country we will not abandon those sports in an attempt to turn medals in individual sports
7380680 my name is not strangelove i dont know about strangelove im not
7380681 our peculiar security is in the possession of a written constitution let
7380682 i give you joe biden this is who my uncle teddy wants
7380683 if mccallum is willing to debate policy with schulich then why wouldnt flaherty debate income trusts with me
7380684 i will underwrite a 50 000 minimum donation to charity charities in order to debate flaherty
7380685 i dont think jims losing any sleep over it the tax leakage and damage to investors as a matter of fact im sure of it im sure hed love to go a couple of rounds with these guys in a debate situation
7380686 we have seen a growing trend towards corporate tax avoidance top canadian corporations operating within the current rules have announced their intention to convert to income trusts they feel compelled to seek more favourable tax treatment by capitalizing on an available tax rule this trend has now moved into the core of our industrial and knowledge based economy it is a trend that has caused me growing concern if corporations dont pay their share of taxes this tax burden will shift onto the shoulders of hardworking individuals and families this is simply not fair
7380687 the discussions that you are hearing about deferred taxes reflect confusion about budgeting convention versus policy analysis
7380688 restore balance and fairness to the federal tax system by creating a level playing field between income trusts and corporations
7380689 our ability to continue creating value within the trust structure is constrained
7380690 when this minority conservative government undertook what it knew would be a harmful action to canadians it should have taken the utmost care to minimize the damage it would cause its citizens
7380691 the government broke a promise and imposed a radically higher tax that resulted in a 25 billion blow to the savings of hard working canadians
7380692 rather than considering what is best for canadians the prime minister simply decided that he was going to put an end to the income trust sector
7380693 after hearing from dozens of expert witnesses we have developed a proposal that is fair to canadian investors to corporations and the income trust sector as well as federal and provincial governments
7380694 this new proposal would likely return at least of two thirds of the losses experienced by the holders of income trusts after the october 31 announcement
7380695 it would also ensure that canadian investors continue to have a high yield investment vehicle available to them
7380696 i would concur with gordon taits view that at least two thirds of the lost value will be recovered
7380697 while i am not convinced that there is tax leakage and expert opinions differ as to the existence or the extent of the tax leakage this proposed 10 per cent tax would more than cover the problem
7380698 we expect that both the numbers of suspected cases and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues and samples continue to be received from provincial territorial and federal partners
7380699 going through the crisis there are two advisers ive paid no attention to
7380700 the first are the lawyers and the second are the accountants its not about the money or the legal liability this is about our being accountable for providing consumers with safe food
7380701 its highly likely that the hospital meat was related to the death
7380702 im not scared of spiders but daddys scared of spiders but not me just daddy

7380706 if we have the choice of having him for one game or 15 well take the 15
7380707 i think we were very soft in our pass protection in our run game we had a lack of sustaining one on one blocks on the first four passes that jason threw he had somebody walked back into him or he had somebody in his face it is very difficult to play qb from that position they played very aggressive football and we didnt match that intensity
7380708 for both teams because it was a chance to see what the starters could do for a longer period of time and we didnt do anything
7380709 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
7380710 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
7380711 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states
7380712 if the recapitalisation talk is realised there are no assurances that the securities that have been issued by u s mortgage firms will be 100 per cent guaranteed

7380734 no tuvimos una buena actitud en el sentido en que no quer amos nada con la pelota en actitud el equipo siempre la tiene en cuanto a presionar y no dejar jugar al rival pero sabemos jugar y en el primer tiempo lo demostramos y en el segundo quer amos que el tiempo pasara y eso no era lo que hab amos conversado obviamente la presi n la tendr an ellos por querer empatar o acortar la distancia y ah nosotros ten amos que jugar de otra manera y tener la pelota y llegar pues tenemos los recursos necesarios para atacar a cualquier equipo

7380758 media buyers are divided about a battle unfolding between the nine and seven networks over whether the full 17 days of official olympic games activity should be excluded from the official television ratings year
7380759 tv audience measurement company oztam traditionally excludes only the two ratings weeks that fall entirely within the games period from its official 40 week ratings survey period each year
7380760 nine has already begun to lobby for a 35 per cent share of advertisers budgets next year it got just 31

7380767 it was karl barth i believe who said that trying to make the gospel relevant to the contemporary age was like running after the train that has just left

7380786 but people cant be trusted to take care of all those things themselves
7380787 i dont suggest that a few people govern everyone in an authoritarian manner those politicians and bureaucrats are chosen by the entire populace so democratic government is how society governs
7380788 vagueness does not inspire the confidence of people and leaves room for gaming the system by outside groups
7380789 when the rules are clear and the grievance procedures are clear then people know what they are working with and they at least have a starting point in urging changes in those rules
7380790 in the natural balance of things in a free society large companies and business executives hold a level of power over the public that the public finds unacceptable being more numerous they elect government representatives to remedy this and serve their interests protecting them against the predatory practices of powerful corporations and individuals

7380807 de vergelijking die wordt gemaakt is ongehoord en totaal onaanvaardbaar
7380808 het is wel duidelijk dat wereldberoemde sterren totaal geen scrupules hebben als het gaat om het steunen van barack obama dit is gewoon laag bij de grond
7380809 in 1962 en 1967 hebben we korte briefjes in onze brievenbus gehad waarop enkel stond dat alles in orde was met hem maar of hij die effectief heeft geschreven ik weet het niet
7380810 ik werk samen met een advocaat om te zien of ik mijn vader officieel als vermist en daarna als overleden kan opgeven
7380811 op die manier kan ik controle krijgen over zijn bankrekening pas in 1997 ontdekten mijn broer mijn zus en ik dat hij nog een bankrekening heeft waar 1 2 miljoen euro op staat als ik daar aan geraak wil ik een deel van het geld besteden aan het in kaart brengen van de gruwelijkheden in het concentratiekamp mauthausen

7380814 theres going to be a lot of rhetoric coming out of the convention but we want to match that with barack obamas record and tell people hes not ready to be president
7380815 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7380816 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7380817 theres a lot of hillary supporters that are concerned that obama doesnt have the experience necessary to be commander in chief and we are going to be very aggressive in reaching out to them

7380819 estamos de acuerdo en que se debe reformar el estatuto pero no es el momento hay otras prioridades se deben reformar varios art culos del estatuto como ser que los delegados duren m s de un a o en su mandato al igual que el s ndico titular
7380820 nosotros consultamos a la asesora legal de face quien dijo que esos temas eran para tratar en una reuni n informativa con los delegados titulares y no en una asamblea extraordinaria
7380821 comenzaremos a analizar la manera en la que capacitaremos a los productores que hasta el momento son casi 100 de ah en m s el objetivo es ir creciendo en otras localidades como leandro n alem san javier ap stoles y olegario v ctor andrade entre otras
7380822 queremos darle un fuerte impulso a los cultivos frutihort colas para permitirles una fuente de ingreso a los productores que se dedican a la yerba al tabaco o alg n otro tipo de cultivo creemos que esta puede se una buena alternativa para los colonos
7380823 si producimos m s verduras y frutas vamos a poder comercializar tanto en la zona como en las ferias francas de posadas donde una buena parte de los productores se acerca a vender

7380840 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7380841 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7380842 what we have witnessed in beijing is a truly spectacular olympic games
7380843 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7380844 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7380845 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7380846 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7380847 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7380848 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7380849 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7380850 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7380851 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7380852 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7380853 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7380854 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure
7380855 we need somebody who talks tough whos going to act smart and be tough thats how were going to look after the safety of the american people
7380856 i dont think hes ready to be president and when youre commander in chief you shouldnt be having to select a mentor to help you with that role
7380857 allarrivo dellimmensa astronave madre che giganteggia nel film indipendence day

7380859 i was happy to make them but now i need to make a living
7380860 his hair is so strange chinese politicians would never have hair like that its very chaotic
7380861 china has 5 000 years of history so of course we have lots of different aspects to our culture that we can show at the ceremony
7380862 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7380863 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7380864 and chinese efforts of an authentic giant of the world economy and sports
7380865 regarding their organization inauguration and closure they have made us to be excited till the tears
7380866 china must be recognized as a millennial country that keeps its traditions but also puts technology at the service of the modernity and it achieves to impact in all the senses to the millions of people who followed this event in the entire planet
7380867 amazing way the form in which china is saying good bye to all his guests
7380868 after have lived so much emotions and after so many years and months of preparation in all the senses
7380869 these olympic games mark the beginning of a new stage not only on sports but also technology development
7380870 the olympics were a world party where it shined the great development of china achieved in the last decades it will be very difficult that london 2012 could surpass beijing 2008
7380871 chine proved that it is possible to mix an ancient culture with the modern science technology and humanism
7380872 people were expecting so much from us last season and i think that kind of went to guys heads
7380873 now they dont expect anything from us i always liked being the underdog i hope people think were the worst team in the nation and talk bad about us every week
7380874 i can see the outside view that there is lots of inexperience
7380875 what people have overlooked is i have never seen a group of guys work harder since i have been at ucla we need to grow up and the only way to do that is by playing i feel there will be a dramatic change in every series we play from the first game and every game after that
7380876 he looks you right in the eye and tells you if he made a mistake i like that in guys
7380877 i dont know what outside expectations are nor do i care
7380878 i love it when people trash us it drives us
7380879 ive seen teams rise to levels that maybe individually you couldnt imagine
7380880 i played on a team that went to the rose bowl are starting 0 3 1 in 1983 expectations are low outside looking in not inside those are always high and we have to try to hold each other to them
7380881 first of all when people say well this is you know the 21st century well have antibiotics today antibiotics are a just in time delivery product in many hospitals weve seen an increase number of hospitals in this country get deliveries three times a day now for pharmaceutical and central supply products well run out overnight

7380934 its not like were going to canada to find some pet laws these are missouri folks whove found a way to deal with it
7380935 we do know that at least 500 animals have been spayed because of the litter ordinance its an incentive for people to do the right thing and get their pets spayed or neutered
7380936 if they dont have a litter permit theyre given 10 days to get one

7380940 the man has the right to make a statement like that

7380942 i dont put pressure on him and say if we dont win 11 games
7380943 there are so many variables such as injuries and bad luck
7380944 it was evident we had two bad years especially last year and he needed to make some changes
7380945 its like any business youve got to stay abreast of whats happening and stay current
7380946 i always study the top five top 10 every season offense defense organization special teams i enjoy football so i keep on top of new trends and whats happening
7380947 and mike studies all the time thats how you keep up with the game thats how he stays a step ahead
7380948 i think anybody thats in this profession always understands theyre in the hot seat
7380949 thats the nature of this game the reason you stay with the job that you have is because you win and if you dont win you dont keep your job
7380950 i think its even stronger now than it was when i was younger because you realize youre just on top of so many factors that exist and because youre 10 15 20 years older
7380951 you understand the highs and lows and what it takes to stay on top and how important these games are
7380952 its not just missing the playoffs its what kind of product are you putting on the field youre 7 9 and we didnt play well i took it very personal made some changes some tough changes and they were changes i had to make
7380953 when you predict you should win 10 games every year and you dont it comes down to me i always believe we should be in the playoffs like i said i believe well be in the playoffs this year if we stay healthy i think well get there
7380954 when i first found out i was relieved cutler explained
7380955 i was wondering what was wrong with me for 5 6 months trying to figure out what was wrong with me as i was losing weight thankfully it is treatable and we can move on everything went through my mind i was dead tired before games so tired i didnt even feel like playing thats odd i love football i love my job i was just so worn down
7380956 i talked to brandon before the news conference took place
7380957 i told him everything that i was going to say i told him exactly how i felt and how the team perceived the entire situation you only get so many chances in this league and brandon was running out of them it was time for him to step up and help the team help himself and be a professional and he understood that it was something that had to be done it wasnt ok he was hurting the team and he understood that
7380958 you have a better feel for the playbook for your teammates for coach shanahan you have a better feel for defenses you know where weak points are you know where to go with the ball our offensive line looks great its my third year with brandon marshall we have a great rhythm eddie royal has been a great addition everything is going really well
7380959 i havent had a left tackle like this guy since ive been here
7380960 i know it is out there it is what the expectations are when you are a first round quarterback going into your third year
7380961 people want you to be the player they drafted you to be its the year you are supposed to come into your own i hear it but i cant worry about it i just need to be on top of my game and study and do my job
7380962 it was all you heard about its settled down a bit you hear about it every once in a while but it isnt something i concern myself with

7380967 bekend zijn de verhalen van mensen inclusief die van mezelf die ontsnapten aan rampen denk hierbij aan het wtc en de rampen met vliegtuigen de aanslag op het wtc werd al in 1988 voorspeld alleen de datum wist de paragnost niet ook prince voorspelde die aanlag

7380970 im just so excited about how many want to go forward
7380971 i know we have a lot of great young talent in the nba that will probably be on the 2012 team im more than committed to being on this team again
7380972 i look back at 2004 and im so proud right now
7380973 that person will have a structure that jerry and all these people have built
7380974 i think the greatest part of the continuity should be jerry and the players the ones who still feel like they can give that type of commitment
7380975 the young guys coming up that want to be a part of this make sure you have right mindset
7380976 thats be unselfish with everything its not about you shining its about the team shining
7380977 they had a bad start before they left for athens in 2004 but with lebron and those guys coming back for this and telling everyone how cool it is its going to be a hot ticket theres going to be a lot of competition to play for this team

7380981 weve been working hard all summer to come back and show that it wasnt a fluke and that were a good team
7380982 were working hard to carry the team were all upperclassmen so i think it will be a good year
7380983 thats one of our main motivations to show that wasnt a fluke it wasnt a once in a lifetime thing
7380984 our expectation even last year is game in and game out to perform fundamentals if we perform our fundamentals it doesnt matter what the other team does
7380985 our expectations are to take it one point at a time
7380986 my first year here we went to grove and lost we shared the conference title with grove and that was our only loss
7380987 the girls have already talked about that weve never won in groves gym
7380988 a lot of teams have one strong hitter or one strong something or other but when you have one hitter it makes it a lot easier to defend
7380989 with our setter she can go anywhere with any pass it makes it hard to defend
7380990 how likely is it for any team to repeat winning a state championship is hard
7380991 winning it a second time harder the only thing this team has over most teams is we did it with a bunch of juniors and they get to come back as seniors

7381130 a growing number of companies are finding that lower visibility web oriented architecture woa developments spawned through grassroots movements are a better route to the service oriented architecture woa like soa is an architectural approach to system design though woa is resource oriented rather than service oriented whats the difference while the core soa design unit is a reusable service that fulfills a distinct business function resource oriented services are more limited and data focused
7381131 by going the woa plus rest route instead of soa plus soap the requirements for extending the application dropped considerably

7381149 it all started to sink in and i had to take a step out and just kind of collect my thoughts and collect my emotions
7381150 i dont know if i have the words for what that says about a man
7381151 thats an amazing thing to be able to compartmentalize on a certain level to be so in the moment when youre here in usa volleyball gear then go away and deal with whatever hes had to deal with
7381152 so when i had to take some time off i knew it wasnt helping the team and i knew that when i came back i had to be 100 percent invested in what we were doing
7381153 she was certainly one of the major proponents of me coming back and finishing what wed started all those years ago
7381154 regardless of what i was doing i hope you also saw that the u s mens volleyball team played a wonderful volleyball match
7381155 this team that probably no one would consider to be worthy of champions has come out and proved everyone wrong
7381156 we can be happy and feel a tinge of sadness as well its possible to be active in both of those spheres
7381157 we were just listening to each other smile on the phone
7381158 obviously this is the best of times and the worst of times

7381163 our calendars where we are supposed to go the addresses
7381164 and its like we are kind of stuck at the moment
7381165 they came with a knife its mind boggling to think something like this could happen
7381166 it was terrible for us because they are black and we are black and so they are like stealing from their own brothers and sisters

7381177 dia hillary akan menjadi suara penting dalam kampanye ini dan dalam menggerakkan negara ini menuju pemerintahan baru namun dia obama merasa kalau senator biden merupakan yang paling cocok untuknya saat ini
7381178 senator clinton akan menyampaikan pidato hebat pada selasa malam kita pada akhirnya akan muncul sebagai partai yang bersatu karena kita tahu taruhannya sangat besar dan kita harus mengubah arah negeri ini

7381195 whether its the athletes village or the venues theyve done an incredible job

7381216 china never before entered the worlds gaze in this role
7381217 the opportunity of the olympics has allowed us to calmly show a more open and self confident china after 30 years of reform and opening up
7381218 this great country still immersed in an olympics honeymoon is on an emotional high
7381219 her people have never been so optimistic and self confident so full of faith in their countrys advancement
7381220 the carefully orchestrated facade could not conceal a police state that tramples on human rights
7381221 faced with such suspicions accusations and unfriendliness china from the state leadership level to the ordinary public did not accuse and complain
7381222 china stood before the world as a great power with unprecedented openness and self confidence
7381223 the best present it could hope for on its 63rd anniversary of independence
7381224 the best present for the president and for the people of the country
7381225 take joy in seeing that on the grand stage of the olympic games the asian tempest blows stronger and stronger
7381226 it is a positive sign that the sports in which south korean athletes are strong have become more diverse compared to the past when they were only good in some sports such as archery or martial arts
7381227 eating into not only koreas strong sports but also those of the world
7381228 chinas ability to carry out these technically excellent games to win so many medals will be an important chapter in the resurrection of asian confidence

7381235 the defendant and the others shoved the complainant dropped her to the floor beat her slammed her head against the floor and kicked her all over her body
7381236 the defendant or one of the others sat on her head in a bid to prevent her from seeing what was going on and to prevent her from resisting
7381237 a man who is allegedly willing to take part in the cruel beating of a young and helpless woman suspected of socializing with married men and all this solely for money is a dangerous conscienceless person with no inhibitions

7381243 anyone who grew up with bob dole has to like a guy like joe biden who says what he thinks

7381264 come appassionato di calcio ho apprezzato la prestazione dellinter quella della roma e anche quella della terna arbitrale non sembrava una partita di agosto le squadre si sono date battaglia per oltre due ore giocando con ritmo e intensit almeno per unora di gioco siamo riusciti a mettere in pratica quanto preparato in settimana pressing alto sulla fonte del loro gioco mi piaciuta molto anche la reazione finale della squadra che ha portato al gol di balotelli lunica cosa fuori contesto stata la loro seconda rete la squadra ha dimostrato di essere psicologicamente molto forte e tatticamente compatta questo un un gruppo eccezionale
7381265 dopo aver giocato bene unora era inevitabile un crollo visto il caldo e lumidit che cera comunque abbiamo mantenuto intatta la voglia di vincere e alla fine nel complesso abbiamo meritato questa supercoppa con questo modulo gioco pi avanti senza preoccuparmi della fase divensiva abbiamo cambiato modo di giocare stiamo lavorando per cercare di mettere in pratica sul campo quello che il mister vuole
7381266 avremmo meritato di vincere nei 90 minuti ma nel calcio il merito non conta bisogna fare gol e in questo siamo stati pari ai rigori siamo stati un po pi bravi il ruolo di difensore giocavo li quando ero pi giovane e sono tornato a occupare questa posizione senza problemi ma ci che conta il gruppo non la volont del singolo
7381267 linter partita meglio e per 45 minuti ci stata superiore e stava meglio fisicamente nel secondo tempo poi siamo andati meglio noi il finale sembrava tutto scritto gol al 90 rigore decisivo di totti che era il figlioccio prediletto del presidente a cui volevamo dedicare questa coppa peccato daltronde lo sport questo e ne prendiamo atto limportante che abbiamo dimostrato che la roma c e pu giocarsela con tutti anche questanno
7381268 animals do adapt to their environments ms yancey tells her students but evolution alone can hardly account for the appearance of wholly different life forms she leaves it up to them to draw their own conclusions but when pressed she tells them i think god did it mr campbell was well aware of her opinion i dont think we have this great massive change over time where we go from fish to amphibians from monkeys to man she once told him we see lizards with different shaped tails we dont see blizzards the lizard bird with some approximation of courtesy mr campbell reminded her that only a tiny fraction of organisms that ever lived had been preserved in fossils even so he informed his own students scientists have discovered thousands of fossils that provide evidence of one species transitioning into another including feathered dinosaurs

7381270 and sauls servants said unto him behold now an evil spirit from god troubleth thee let our lord now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well

7381275 she was in the wrong place at the wrong time
7381276 the first thing is for sparc to do a review for government on how the actual targeting of the high performance and most likely medal winning sports actually went and then have a look at whats a realistic budget
7381277 i dont have a feeling for how much more but what i know is that to do well at the olympics you cant just be the gifted amateur
7381278 you do need that total focus you do need all the support that we can wrap around our athletes
7381279 we can never be totally happy the world is moving on in terms of performance and if we stay still we will get further behind so what that means is that in our review which will take place when we get back we have to look for another edge
7381280 absolutely of course people are hurting because of change in the economy but i think this is an appropriate spend
7381281 its not just about medals its about encouraging participation that leads to better health and tackling obesity

7381301 but he felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7381302 senator obama had a great conversation with senator clinton this week as well as former president bill clinton everybodys on board and its going to drive the media crazy when we come out of this convention united
7381303 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7381304 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7381305 i am thrilled that joe biden will be my vice president the conversations weve been having over the past couple of days make me absolutely convinced he is the right man for the job
7381306 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots
7381307 it may not be as good as the other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice the american people are going to face in november

7381314 you should know that most dentists wont let you go back with the patient
7381315 so you may want to get him ready for the appointment
7381316 what is the best way to position my skills and services in a way that differentiates me from other writers or copywriters
7381317 dont talk money before we even get the details hashed out i want to be convinced you are the right person for the job before i have to think about the mechanics i know you have to get paid you seem like an amateur if you jump into contracts and payment too soon
7381318 i managed my local staff my cross country staff and my overseas staff if one dropped the ball i had recourse by going over their head or impacting their salary review i could manage their behavior because we were on the same team if my freelancer dropped the ball i had no recourse sure i could deny payment but i still looked bad to my bosses since most of them didnt seem to care if i ever hired them again i had little power to get the work done well
7381319 maybe they need the work and thats why they lie they tell you they have skill x or y and its plain after you get started that they just dont samples are a good start but theres no substitute for having something done for me directly and too often for whatever reason they just cant produce what they claimed along with this comes the excuses unlike real employees freelancers seem to feel they can just stop work or do a poor job if they have any sort of personal or equipment problem its a disease
7381320 i write and i hire writers i have to there is plenty of work more than enough but some writers think they are the be all and end all of writing as if i couldnt hire another two or three whenever i wanted ive got lots of things in the works i dont have the time to deal with wannabe stephen kings if you are stephen king im not hiring you anyhow bottom line you work for me so work
7381321 pretty much the same as above but presents as the job is too hard i dont have the resources or the time these folks have an endless series of complaints and excuses and if i have a criticism dont take it personally i cant stand it when freelancers dont listen when they get piqued because i need a change im not out to offend i just want the final product to meet my expectations and my vision
7381322 the guys have really come to the party its quite unnatural for them and some of them have felt a bit out of their depth but theyve really got stuck in and been good sports about it really
7381323 of course he spends most of his time in speedos anyway so hes pretty comfortable in his underwear
7381324 im supportive of sport in general and especially sport in wellington and glad to help
7381325 abstract there is strong evidence to suggest that the open access advantage is declining by about 7 per year from 32 in 2004 to 11 in 2007
7381326 authors selectively choose which articles to promote freely and highly cited authors disproportionately choose open access venues
7381327 in the first controlled trial of open access publishing where articles were randomly assigned to either open access or subscription access status we recently reported that no citation advantage could be attributed to access status
7381328 we examine the citation performance of author choice open access
7381329 methods the uptake of the open access author choice programs for these 11 journals ranged from 5 to 22 over the dates analyzed
7381330 for all of the journals all articles roll into free access after an initial period restricted to subscription access only for 12 months 8 journals 6 months 2 journals or 24 months 1 journal
7381331 cumulative article citations were retrieved on june 1 2008 the age of the articles ranged from 18 to 57 months
7381332 statistical analysis because citation distributions are known to be heavily skewed seglen 1992 and because some of the articles were not yet cited in our dataset we followed the common practice of adding one citation to every article and then taking the natural log
7381333 for each journal we ran a reduced 2 predictor model article age and oa and a full 7 predictor regression model age oa log no
7381334 because we may lack the statistical power to detect small significant differences for individual journals we also analyze our data on an aggregate level
7381335 the first model includes all 11 journals and the second omits the proceedings of the national academy of sciences pnas considering that it contributed nearly one third 32 of all articles in our dataset
7381336 we are able to control for variables that are well known to predict future citations but we cannot control for the quality of an article
7381337 spending a fee to make ones article freely available from a publishers website may indicate there is something qualitatively different about that article
7381338 results the difference in citations between open access and subscription based articles is small and non significant for the majority of the journals under investigation
7381339 because we may lack the statistical power to detect small significant differences for individual journals we also analyze our data on an aggregate level
7381340 where only time and open access status are the model predictors five of the eleven journals show positive and significant open access effects
7381341 analyzing all journals together we report a small but significant increase in article citations of 21
7381342 much of this citation increase can be explained by the influence of one journal pnas when this journal is removed from the analysis the citation difference reduces to 14
7381343 when other explanatory predictors of citations number of authors pages section etc are included in the full model only two of the eleven journals show positive and significant open access effects analyzing all journals together we estimate a 17 citation advantage which reduces to 11 if we exclude pnas
7381344 the modest citation advantage for author choice open access articles also appears to weaken over time figure 1 plots the predicted number of citations for the average article in our dataset this difference is most pronounced for articles published in 2004 a 32 advantage and decreases by about 7 per year supplementary table s2 until 2007 where we estimate only an 11 citation advantage
7381345 to calculate the estimated cost per citation 400 9000 we multiply the open access citation advantage for each journal a multiplicative effect by the impact factor of the journal considering the strong evidence of a decline of the citation advantage over time the cost would be much higher
7381346 that we were able to explain some of the citation advantage by controlling for differences in article characteristics strengthens the evidence that self selection not access is the explanation for the citation advantage more citable articles have a higher probability of being made freely accessible
7381347 earlier studies on the oa advantage may be showing an early adopter effect
7381348 authors who deposited their manuscripts in the arxiv tended to be more highly cited than those who did not
7381349 any relative citation advantage that was enjoyed by early adopters would disappear over time
7381350 if a citation advantage is the key motivation of authors to pay open access fees then the cost benefit of this decision can be quite expensive for some journals
7381351 randomized controlled trials provide a more rigorous methodology for measuring the effect of access independently of other confounding effects davis et al 2008 the differences we report in our study have more likely explained the effect of self selection or self promotion than of open access per se
7381352 all of the journals under investigation make their articles freely available after an initial period of time hence any oa advantage would be during these initial months in which there exists an access differential between open access and subscription access articles we would expect therefore that the effect of open access would therefore be strongest in the earlier years of the life of the article and decline over time in other words we would expect our trend figure 1 to operate in the reverse direction
7381353 we are at a loss to come up with alternative explanations to explain the monotonic decline in the citation advantage
7381354 oh mommy im so sorry i love you mommy i sorry mommy
7381355 south africa is a proud nation they want to be winners so yeah the one big message we want to put out there is that we will never go out there and lose a game on purpose
7381356 were the springboks were the world champs and weve lost two games in a row moses adds someone get victor an abacus its three in a row slap if you go into the change room and have a look at the players they definitely feel worse than the crowd out there but its unacceptable its our job its our work its our passion and it is not acceptable to play like that
7381357 i have a new playing style which we are trying to put out there and rome wasnt built in one day
7381358 so we have to be patient i ask the public to give us some time to get to grips about what we want to do if we execute this playing style correctly i think with the speed power and great athleticism combined with talent it is going to be enormous moses adds ooh enormous nuff said and people are going to find it very hard to stop us
7381359 look how we were caught fast asleep in the first part of the super 14 by not changing
7381360 when the teams started changing they won the games so we have to do that
7381361 the players and myself think we are on the right track moses adds perhaps a better track would be winning home matches no they just have to get used to it and they will get used to it we will be there im telling you
7381362 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense

7381388 hes got some major problems like internal bleeding and hes on dialysis so his kidneys are failing again and they are talking again about suspected pneumonia so they are three bad reports
7381389 everything is down and its not looking good but weve still got hope
7381390 deus n o existe a ci ncia j provou isso com pesquisas fant sticas
7381391 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7381392 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7381393 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7381394 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7381395 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7381396 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7381397 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7381398 who are open to doing something on the production side
7381399 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7381400 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7381401 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7381402 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7381403 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7381404 we intend to have hundreds of bikes available in the weeks leading up to the rnc and carry the energy over for a community bike shop after the rnc is dead and gone from this land
7381405 as a health benefits company focused on sustainability it works for us for a lot of different reasons
7381406 so people can make connections to our trails and streets with bike lanes
7381407 the bigger chunk is trying to make a real bike share happen in minneapolis by next may
7381408 in order to have things be anything beyond recreational well have to have an advanced network
7381409 bringing those 1 000 bikes will capture the imagination of the city
7381410 whether those bikes end up being part of the system is an open question
7381411 will have a lot of value to a lot of people
7381412 theres potential for hundreds of bikers throughout city to be using something like this
7381413 the whole idea is for people to use bikes for short trips for utilitarian purposes
7381414 by now all of them have disappeared and thats what happened in every city
7381415 at the same time paris did that they made infrastructure improvements they had policy changes they basically opened up many corridors
7381416 the whole strategy is to favor pedestrian and bicycle transport so you give bicycles and pedestrian advantages over motorists
7381417 you give them shortcuts on a one way street you allow two way for bicycles you provide as much space as you can
7381418 where transportation planners acknowledge that bicycling is a social activity so they want to have bike lanes wide enough to accommodate bicycles two abreast with room for third to pass
7381419 i think somebody will have to say yeah this has become a priority were going to make downtown as bicycle friendly as possible
7381420 whats being neglected in my mind is the concept of routine accommodation
7381421 whenever a street is being improved they should automatically re stripe it to include a bike lane
7381422 we are but its not because we dont share the same enthusiasm minneapolis does our issue is that st paul is designed differently than minneapolis we dont have a chain of lakes infrastructure that can be the hub of bike routes to spoke out from its more complicated in st paul
7381423 you need a full time bike coordinator to take on projects like this
7381424 he made a couple of gaffes that we were about to pick up and put on youtube
7381425 the advantage of this war room is that were all going to be in the same room
7381426 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7381427 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7381428 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7381429 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7381430 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7381431 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7381432 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7381433 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7381434 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7381435 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7381436 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7381437 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7381438 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7381439 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7381440 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7381441 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7381442 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7381443 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7381444 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7381445 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7381446 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7381447 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7381448 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7381449 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7381450 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7381451 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7381452 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7381453 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7381454 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7381455 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7381456 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7381457 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7381458 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7381459 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7381460 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7381461 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7381462 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7381463 i hear my song being sung near the lake and it turns my stomach the problem is that wrens are not always wise they foolishly sing the songs of finches and somehow feel no guilt
7381464 ive spoken to them about it but they dont see my side its a free world they say they think they can borrow a part of a song or a whole song without recrimination
7381465 i told the larks about it and the lark got quite upset they understand the dilemma they believe that when ones heart is put into a song ones entire life is rendered into that beautiful melody which can only be described as the truth it reveals the finch and what the finch believes is sacred

7381475 the growing discrepancy in discounts between greater miamis mainland and the barrier island is not that big of a surprise given todays buying trends
7381476 second home buyers with foreign currencies who tend to be the majority of the todays purchasers prefer the close proximity to the sand surf and nightlife of the barrier island full time residents who are all but invisible or looking to rent in this current market usually opt for the mainland which tends to offer the everyday conveniences at a more affordable price
7381477 we expect the current trend of the growing pricing discrepancy between the barrier island and the mainland to continue to widen
7381478 as buyers scoop up units on the barrier island at smaller discounts sellers on the mainland are faced with trying to differentiate their units from the nearly 21 000 new units that have been constructed since 2003
7381479 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7381480 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7381481 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7381482 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7381483 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7381484 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7381485 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7381486 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7381487 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7381488 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7381489 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

7381502 aqu viv an convencidos de que cuba no segu a sin fidel pero fueron obligados a ser testigos de que cuba no se va a desmoronar y por lo tanto la tesis que formaba el eje del argumento aqu no funciona
7381503 miami permanece como algo parecido a una dictadura como una rep blica bananera no hay democracia real pareciera que nosotros los cubanos no entendemos bien eso de la democracia no es parte de nuestra historia o cultura y los migrantes cubanos particularmente los que viven en miami aparentemente no han logrado captar el concepto
7381504 escuchar lo de cuba en nuestra comunidad es como escuchar m sica vieja son cosas de tus abuelos o tus padres es como escuchar a elvis
7381505 la percepci n que yo tengo de cuba es de los cuentos de mi abuela de los 50 entonces al hablar con los m s reci n llegados es hablar de dos pa ses completamente diferentes

7381515 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7381516 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7381517 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7381518 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7381519 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7381520 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work

7381526 dengan demikian harga per tabung naik dari rp 63 000 menjadi rp 69 000
7381527 sehingga per 25 agustus 2008 harga elpiji kemasan 50 kg akan naik dari rp 343 900 per tabung menjadi rp 362 750 per tabung sementara tahun depan elpiji ukuran 50 kg akan menjadi rp 570 000 per tabung
7381528 dengan kenaikan sekarang pun pertamina masih rugi dalam penjualan elpiji 12 kg dan 50 kg sebesar rp 6 5 triliun per tahun
7381529 sebagian besar di kampung saya sudah mulai pindah ke minyak tanah pakai elpiji sudah sulit carinya juga harganya mahal
7381530 saya heran kwik kian gie pernah bilang seandainya orang indonesia ini mandi gas tiap hari kita nggak akan kehabisan gas tapi nyatanya kok begini
7381531 serba repot kan di daerah sini minyak tanah lebih langka lagi
7381532 kondisinya sama dengan bbm subsidi dan nonsubsidi berpulang kepada kesadaran masyarakat bahwa pemerintah hanya memberikan subsidi kepada masyarakat yang memang berhak
7381533 operasi yustisi itu penting kita sebagai departemen teknis akan selalu berusaha agar ada pengaturan itu

7381535 akar persoalannya uu migas yang hanya mematok 25 persen produksi untuk kebutuan dalam negeri ini harus direvisi
7381536 sesungguhnya wajar saja bagi pertamina menaikkan harga namun seharusnya melakukan sosialisasi dulu
7381537 kebijakan pemerintah tidak jelas soal tata niaga elpiji makanya pertamina bisa seperti ini

7381542 we are closer to world war iii than to november elections
7381543 shelve loose talk about bringing either ukraine or georgia into nato
7381544 washington had better start treating it russia like the great power it is
7381545 the limits of russias post cold war retreat have apparently been reached and the reversal of the power equation has gone too far to be sustained todays leaders in moscow are determined to protect what they perceive as their vital interests
7381546 work out a modus vivendi and tone down the bombast and restore a dialogue with russia
7381547 this conference which is being attended by over 450 of the worlds top scientists is about deepening our understanding of dna it is not about promoting gmo production
7381548 this irish government promotion of agri biotech industry interests is a scandal
7381549 organised by the agri biotech industry to promote its products
7381550 i would be concerned if as has been represented to me abic 2008 is a one sided promotional exercise and does not involve the kind of balance one would expect in a scientific forum especially when taxpayers money is involved
7381551 various national reports have rightly identified biotechnology as one of the core technologies which ireland and irish industry must now embrace the science of biotechnology is good for society and the agricultural industry and we should take confidence from the fact that public health is protected by a very rigorous approval system
7381552 and i think i have boxed out of my skin in the five of them i gave 100 per cent on the night he has got the decision and there is nothing i can do about it
7381553 i can control the way i fight i cant control the five judges around the ring if it had been in dublin i dont know whether he would have got it but thats how sport is he came out on top he is olympic champion i am second best which is heart breaking but that is sport
7381554 still id rather have got to the final and got robbed there than have a bronze
7381555 olympic silver medallist its not bad but i still wanted that gold medal i felt i was in a position to get it but it just slipped through my fingers
7381556 the numbers of cases remain stable with 21 confirmed cases of the outbreak strain of listeria
7381557 while these suspected cases are all positive for listeriosis it is important to note that genetic fingerprinting results are required before they can be linked to this specific outbreak so we expect that both the numbers of suspected cases and the numbers of confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues
7381558 this may mean that we will see new cases of this outbreak strain appear over the next few weeks

7381561 from our standpoint this is the right thing to do if there is any question in the consumers mind about any product from that plant then the onus is on us and the cfia to act decisively and swiftly to restore consumer confidence
7381562 the role of comedians in 2008 is to explore the dark recesses of our mind and come up with the best shows we possible can thats the idea of comedy that ive been working from
7381563 after one of the longest and most animated debates the panel finally chose from this very strong shortlist a comedian whose work can only be summed up as utterly delightful an hour with david odoherty fills the world with laughter and charm and sends you home on a wave of happiness
7381564 when a standup gig goes this well you do get a sense of how religions are started
7381565 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7381566 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7381567 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7381568 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7381569 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7381570 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7381571 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7381572 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7381573 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7381574 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on

7381579 i want to thank absolutely everyone who helped my partner lachlan and my mom vivienne here to support me and watch me get gold because it was so important to have those two people here with me
7381580 i didnt think i had a chance to get the gold and to actually get that was mind blowing i was crying thinking i had silver and to get gold i was a blubbering mess
7381581 its nice to win knowing that i had to play well and then actually doing it
7381582 i had two weeks to try to impress nick the first is out of the way and i seem to have done that i dont know if i have done enough but im going to gleneagles in better shape and hopefully he will take notice
7381583 it was a good effort but all credit to darren
7381584 there are only two picks so its a tight situation but im going to have to win in scotland to give myself a chance as everybody knows its about winning ive no complaints ive not played well enough but theres one more event and ill certainly be giving it 101
7381585 a little bit frustrating because im playing well but cant score well at the moment gleneagles is my last chance ive just got to play my game i cant do anything about the other guys
7381586 f k you you are the society and what can you do all you think of is just yourself so why dont you make yourself a little useful instead of just being mummys little kid

7381589 the companys claim that they cannot afford to settle the dispute is not credible since they are owned by 40 major financial institution worth billions of pounds
7381590 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night before you put the kids after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7381591 i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life
7381592 i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation cindys father who barely finished high school went off and distinguished himself in world war ii in a b 17 and came back with practically nothing and realized the american dream and i am proud and grateful for that and i think he is a role model to many young americans who serve in the military and come back and succeed

7381596 usually i would pass even reading the music blogs that are all independent music but this one was actually good because it did not seem like you had to be a scenester knowing the secret handshake to be allowed to read it they have a good collection of artists from all over the map which is always what i like to see and they have this funny ad running on there site to bring 44 to singapore
7381597 oh my god you all are here with obama i have a feeling something is happening in this country i dont care what folks say about not knowing him and experience all i know is that when the same children that we cant get to pick up trash off these dirty streets are out organizing their friends and families and registering people to vote something good is happening in this country
7381598 in the past in the days of the three networks it was necessary to give off the impression of being nonpartisan
7381599 in the world of television satellite pay cable today the desire or need to appear nonpartisan is no longer necessary
7381600 you are from the very beginning indicating that you are partisan
7381601 our mission is to celebrate african american culture and chronicle african american achievement
7381602 if colin powell were the republican nominee we would be covering that convention for us its not about party its the individual
7381603 potentially hundreds of millions of dollars have been wasted delivery schedules have slipped contractor employees have been laid off
7381604 the end result is a current it system used to identify terrorist threats that has been crippled by technical flaws and a new system that if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today
7381605 gosh mom i thought that preacher was going to scream so loud that he was going to have a heart attack did you see how red his face was
7381606 yeah i might be the worst jew ever but i am becoming a pretty good christian

7381608 living so free is a tragedy when you cant see what you need to see

7381611 did it ever occur to you that i might be jealous of your life
7381612 it is something that i knew i had to see and i wanted her to see it is something she will never forget and something that she will be able to share with her children
7381613 i dont think the american people have awakened to whats happening the next couple of months the possibility of an african american president think about it look how short of a period its been since we came from slavery
7381614 it is one of a number of very important milestones for the african american community but this is going to be the highest
7381615 our people will be thinking of that and what king would have thought of it as well does it really mean a post racial post civil rights america
7381616 when it became apparent that barack would be making his acceptance speech on the anniversary of the great
7381617 i spend a lot of time trying to teach my children that in many respects their destiny is in their own hands i try to expose them to people and events that reinforce the idea that racial and social progress are generally the result of a lot of hard work and sacrifice by lots of people over a very long time baracks nomination stands as a milestone to the sacrifices of thousands of people who preceded us all in the struggle for equality and i wanted my children to see this process to make tangible the lessons ive been teaching them
7381618 it is going to be a capacity crowd in front of televisions in virginia washington d c and maryland
7381619 i have not heard one derogatory remark from anyone saying oh i am not going to watch there is a very thick air of excitement about this particular speech
7381620 represents the hope belief that if he can do it others can certainly follow
7381621 the issue of discrimination and slavery has been about since the founding of the country
7381622 this is the beginning of the resolution of it historic is probably an understatement
7381623 i think some people view it too symbolically and they are not asking tough questions about what this means in terms of policy
7381624 my mother and father were former sharecroppers and i can still remember when we would go to my grandmothers in south carolina in the 1950s they would sit us down and tell us if a white person was walking toward us always step into the streets and never look at a white woman
7381625 now i see the possibility that a family of color could be occupying the
7381626 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether barack obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7381627 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7381628 joe biden believes the war was a mistake john mccain would still do it all over again joe biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years if barack obama and joe biden had set iraq policy these last six years rather than george bush and john mccain we wouldnt be in the hole were in today
7381629 the president always has the right to act preemptively if we are in imminent danger if they are coming up over the hill he can respond if troops are coming out of tijuana heading north we can respond if they are coming down from toronto we can respond if missiles are on their way we can respond but that is not the way i hear it being used here we are talking about preemption as if we are adopting a policy
7381630 the power of the purse is useless because it presents us with a hobsons choice
7381631 we have our fighting men and women in place and we are told by the way the president will not take them home so lets cut off the support for them so they have no guns no bullets no ability to fight a war and no one is willing to do that
7381632 may not be as good as other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice the american people will face in november
7381633 we need to make it personal we need to make it our business to educate folks
7381634 right now in pueblo im the only one im working out of my house im waiting for victory to come in
7381635 right now there are three mccain yard signs that arent spoken for and they cant tell me when i can get more
7381636 weve done it before were a couple of cycles ahead of them on the ground game thats why theyre spending so much money
7381637 sir can i help you update your voter registration or sign up for a mail in ballot
7381638 baracks whole message is i can stand in everyones shoes
7381639 is remarkably underdeveloped when it comes to talking about mixed racial experience the places in between for those people who are neither black nor white but both the opportunity with obama is maybe we can start to craft this language to break out of that calcified language america has held on to for all these years
7381640 there was another time when another young candidate was running for president and challenging america to cross a new frontier
7381641 he faced public criticism from the preceding democratic president who was widely respected in the party
7381642 ted has been at the forefront of every single cause thats important to democrats for my entire adult life
7381643 having gotten to know him in the senate what i came to realize was hes probably the hardest working senator that we have and during this campaign what ive seen is the sheer joy he gets out of politics he cares so deeply about the people hes fighting for but he also just enjoys being the mix and the give and take
7381644 the man who just spoke is going to be president of the united states and he is going to change this country
7381645 the kennedy family has been with us from the very early days
7381646 every major civil rights battle senator kennedy has been there hes been a warrior hes been a fighter hes been a workhorse for civil rights
7381647 everybody working on the campaigns for the parties for the state parties you can run into them talk to them learn from them get their cards and its quite useful
7381648 the very fact of the hype attracts so many moths to the flame and theres a ton of information you pick up that is valuable in the longer term
7381649 its pretty absurd that there are 15 000 media people going theres not enough news and information to feed all those journalists you have to be careful not to spend too much time trading conventional wisdom with other reporters
7381650 with population growth and more demand on the power grid we have to start asking ourselves where were going to continue getting our energy from
7381651 the thing about those buildings is when the power goes out then what
7381652 a building like this is essentially its own power plant
7381653 she came to me because theres been a big splash in the newspaper
7381654 the board is making a big to do about something they previously approved theyre very defensive about the fact that shes gotten this retirement plan they gave her its crazy they gave her the plan two years ago and now theyre concerned about it because somebodys written about it
7381655 its a publicity nightmare because the board hasnt taken the right approach to the situation
7381656 shes 63 years old and she expects to retire in two years
7381657 will go directly to the girl scouts or some other nonprofit
7381658 the fact that the board has been sneaky and tried to slip all this past the public
7381659 theyve come up with a lot of excuses and theyre not good excuses
7381660 it seems like somewhere along the line the ball was dropped
7381661 i dont understand what the benefit package was supposed to be that wasnt being met i dont ever remember discussing retirement benefits we discussed salary and bonus
7381662 the shame of it is the united way is a good organization
7381663 and unfortunately theyre going to be hurt by this there are services in the community that wont be funded because of this
7381664 she didnt ask for it they offered it to her
7381665 were negotiating about the situation and how it can best be solved
7381666 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7381667 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7381668 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7381669 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

7381676 these are your memories they are precious images fade negatives never do
7381677 we are closer to world war iii than to november elections
7381678 the statements of some nato representatives that the maneuvers of the alliances ships in the black sea were planned a year ago are evidence that attacks on south ossetia and abkhazia were planned earlier maybe even last year
7381679 this election is all about whether obama is in the mccain campaigns phrase ready to lead
7381680 if a majority think the answer is yes he wins if a majority think the answer is no mccain wins
7381681 people need to get a handle on him in the end this election is about him he needs to let people know as much about his values and priorities as he can in four days
7381682 the images of both men are by now indelibly imprinted on voters minds
7381683 rather than wasting time defining himself or his opponent senator obama should define his pathway for changing the direction of this country
7381684 obama needs to define himself but others must define mccain
7381685 as long as hillarys forces continue to be sore losers and obamas people are arrogant sore winners they will never fully heal
7381686 how wonderful that youre pregnant have a brilliant new job have met your soul mate
7381687 the unaffiliated voter has shifted and weve seen it throughout the west

7381705 i couldnt live with myself if i didnt do everything i could to get obama elected
7381706 the last time virginians voted for a democrat for president was 1964 before the voting rights act of 1965 was passed i think its shameful thats what turned it and i think its a beautiful thing that an african american candidate is going to turn it back the american experience has engendered this really festering wound over race its the elephant in the room i dont think this is going to solve it but it will go a long way

7381738 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever thank you to the people of china
7381739 we need to drill here and we need to drill now
7381740 punk rock is exemplary manners towards your fellow human beings
7381741 usually i would pass even reading the music blogs that are all independent music but this one was actually good because it did not seem like you had to be a scenester knowing the secret handshake to be allowed to read it they have a good collection of artists from all over the map which is always what i like to see and they have this funny ad running on there site to bring 44 to singapore
7381742 freshly after our canceled tour with zebrahead we had our trailer broken into
7381743 los datos de los pa ses sugieren que la contracci n del cr dito fruto de la crisis financiera internacional se ha traducido fundamentalmente en una restricci n del acceso al cr dito a los consumidores y no tanto en una subida de los tipos de inter s hipotecarios

7381748 were thinking of making a poster out of it for the common room
7381749 and a dozen more at each table here this morning
7381750 hes hardly an inch shorter than you harry and hes a year younger
7381751 any day that starts with malfoy looking like that cant be all bad
7381752 some heir he is eh old salazar probably wants to chuck him back out again
7381753 well the family he works for arent very nice to him but he clearly cant say that and when you asked him about the heir of slytherin he couldnt talk about that either
7381754 if he is the heir of slytherin hes going to be out for blood
7381755 we may still have to wait for some of the others but at least we can have the base ready
7381756 make the fire stay like that i mean shouldnt it burn out or fall or something it does when we cast it
7381757 just cast it at the air instead of an object and think about wanting it to keep burning it wont last forever but it should be fine if i re start it once a day
7381758 i myself do not suspect that mr malfoy is involved in this but i trust that professor dumbledore will draw his own conclusions
7381759 as you should know our parents twenty fourth anniversary is tomorrow ive selected a card as im sure none of the rest of you have taken the time to do so
7381760 the least you can do is sign it ronald here
7381761 thanks for everything happy twenty fourth all our love ginny amp harry
7381762 we have to get some fluxweed picked at a full moon but it cant be stale when we add it we just missed a full moon which means well have to get it after december ninth we have at least another eleven days of simmering after that if everything goes perfectly so the very soonest it could be ready is the twenty first
7381763 could be a once in a lifetime chance to hang around here with permission
7381764 two weeks in the castle with almost nobody around cant pass up an opportunity like that
7381765 youve spent quite a lot of time in africa havent you the deserts and the jungles both
7381766 ahh no of course not ive read about them you see and i was curious
7381767 we had to keep an eye out for them in the trees its not terribly difficult for wizards and witches to protect themselves but we didnt want to startle the boomslangs into attacking other creatures
7381768 yes theyre quite common theres even one in the forest here though i have no idea how it got there
7381769 its a bit unusual isnt it having an african snake in a forest in scotland
7381770 a bit i suppose but really alex its much less odd than many of the other creatures hagrids seen in this area
7381771 no he found some skin it shed its in the rafters of his cabin
7381772 ive read about boomslangs but it would be wonderful to see the moulting
7381773 well i certainly dont mind and im sure hagrid wont either
7381774 i think so the skin is hard to get in the first place at least around here but it doesnt have to be in perfect condition and it doesnt require any special preparation as long as we can shred it it should work
7381775 hagrid luna told us that you have a shed boomslang skin
7381776 aye tha i do isnt whole but its close found it near a nest o salamanders
7381777 i read that you can measure the scales on a moulting and study the patterns to determine the size and gender of the snake and id love to try that
7381778 there yeh go reckon its a fairly bigun but thas just guessin i only read up enough to work out which sort it was dont go in much for snakes
7381779 i think youre probably right boomslangs arent one of the really big species but these scales are fairly large its probably quite large for its kind
7381780 do you do you suppose i could have a bit
7381781 i dont remember the patterns to determine the gender and it would help to be able to have the skin next to the book
7381782 thank you very much hagrid that will be really interesting
7381783 youre doing something that needs boomslang skin is it dangerous
7381784 you dont have to tell me i dont really think id like to participate and its supposed to be a secret you can tell me once the story has an ending
7381785 we promise well tell you afterwards and if you change your mind before then just say so
7381786 i dont think i will im really quite busy i would never have guessed that history of magic could be so challenging
7381787 i hope you both know that in most circumstances i am happy to entertain questions about schoolwork beyond your current level i have even taught you spells typically reserved for fourth and fifth years
7381788 i do not do this to give you any advantage over your classmates it is not proper for me to place you on unequal footing with them especially as i would not necessarily teach them these spells even if they asked me to
7381789 however in this case i am not sure i can avoid giving you that advantage it is a matter of safety
7381790 what it actually does is separate two objects most often it is used to remove someones wand from their hand but that is not its only use regardless it is the first truly combative spell we teach to our second years and professor lockhart should be presenting it to you soon
7381791 yes ginny and unlike professor flitwicks favourite light charm it can easily be dangerous if misused i think it is important for the two of you to have some practice with the spell before using it on a fellow student in the classroom im certain you do not wish to harm any of your classmates
7381792 the pedestal weighs approximately twice as much as one of your classmates and the stone was much heavier than a wand
7381793 as you can see the stone made a very effective projectile i was careful to cast the spell so that it flew away from us
7381794 you are capable of a much much stronger spell than that one you might well have sent the pedestal flying across the room and obliterated the small stone completely do you see why this spell is dangerous especially for you
7381795 first you will learn to cast the spell properly then we will practice casting it lightly hopefully our work with the throw dough conjuration will aid us once again
7381796 by default the smaller object will fly towards you and the larger away from you which is what makes the spell so useful for disarming by adjusting your intent you can send it in another direction try again
7381797 i doubt that professor lockhart will introduce this spell this week
7381798 so we will have next week at the least to control your strength more effectively
7381799 bit odd that the birds are so stuffy about where you sit isnt it
7381800 playing quidditch you always say that harrys a better seeker than you are because hes better at finding the snitch but surely thats not all youre both really good fliers and you should be faster on a broom ginny so why doesnt that sort of balance you out
7381801 for one thing he likes that kind of flying a bit better than i do i like to twist and turn he likes to dive and fly as fast as he can get away with
7381802 she turns faster than i do which is really good and she doesnt need glasses
7381803 course it does during the final last year she saw the snitch when it was way off to her left i wouldnt have been able to see it at all without turning my head so it would have taken me a little longer to spot it
7381804 your glasses dont cover your peripheral vision why dont you get contacts
7381805 i never had the chance i wouldnt even know where to go to get them ive had these glasses since i was five
7381806 there might be an optometrist in ottery st catchpole even of course wizards probably have a better way than contacts
7381807 ive never heard of it dad and percy have always worn glasses
7381808 if we can have silly things like droobles best blowing gum surely theres a magical way to correct nearsightedness
7381809 thats not the point you should at least get contacts harry then youd have good peripheral vision too
7381810 i cant see any way to do it this year though remind us for the summer holidays
7381811 were competing with slytherin in the end and the snakesll flatten them both
7381812 shred it into strips exactly the same width as the scales each one should end up looking like a single column of scales all the same width we can each shred a bit and then use only the best strips
7381813 snape brews all kinds of potions in the evenings ive seen him at it during detentions if hes got it already brewed we could take some and skip all this
7381814 we might be able to keep anyone else from getting attacked between now and christmas
7381815 and we could be sure of getting a proper potion
7381816 i think were doing quite well here but id rather be sure of the finished product
7381817 we dont know for sure that he has any polyjuice potion so we need to keep working on ours
7381818 his office i assume thats not the sort of thing you leave lying around in a classroom
7381819 youre plotting how to steal the potion but youre not going to do it i am
7381820 do you know what polyjuice potion looks like if its not labelled do you know exactly how much we need for this and how to measure it out without contaminating it
7381821 right so im doing it ive already looked up everything i need to know besides if im caught he wont be as hard on me ive got a clean record
7381822 you cant just walk into his office and nick whatever you like
7381823 thats where you two come in youre going to distract snape during class so that i can get into his office
7381824 im sure you could do it ron but youve had quite enough detentions already
7381825 well try to steal the potion on thursday the double lesson should give you plenty of time to cause a distraction
7381826 you shouldve seen it hermione malfoys face when his head started to swell priceless priceless
7381827 come on hermione it was funny you know it was did you see parkinson
7381828 how did you manage to get the earthworms into it
7381829 and the best part is we got away with it
7381830 well i hate to spoil the moment but i couldnt find the potion
7381831 as it turns out he does have everything labelled and its all alphabetised there are two locked cupboards but i didnt dare try to open them he would surely have protected them against alohomora
7381832 i will be candid i told you several weeks ago that professor lockhart would soon be teaching you the disarming charm he should have done that by now that he has not is inexplicably negligent
7381833 given that he has not presented the spell i am not sure we should continue practicing it you are already quite good at it better than any second year should be before a formal lesson
7381834 if you had been taught the spell in class i would have no problem helping you to master it further i would offer the same assistance to any student who asked without malicious intent but i do not think it fair to give you any more advantage over your classmates than you already have so i am not sure what we should do
7381835 err would it be terribly unusual for someone to have learned the spell outside of class
7381836 no i suppose not there are certainly many spells that are not taught at hogwarts as we discussed last year and witches and wizards inevitably learn those spells elsewhere
7381837 so if we know the spell already and we want to practice it on our own thats got nothing to do with you does it
7381838 what if we just cast it for our own reasons then and you keep a close watch to make sure were not going to hurt ourselves
7381839 thats not teaching its just err being a responsible grown up
7381840 if you two would like to practice the spell in my presence i will not object
7381841 in terms of you know safety do you think wed be okay casting the spell on each other we think that might be the next thing to try
7381842 i think that would be safe enough provided there is a responsible grown up nearby to keep watch on you im sure you will be well motivated to be careful
7381843 thirty points from gryffindor for sitting at this particular table and detention tonight at six oclock here for being an arrogant self centred child
7381844 if i could prove exactly who disturbed my class last week you would already have been expelled if anything like that happens again you will not escape the proper punishment
7381845 those of you who did not produce a passable swelling solution last week will write an essay detailing the proper uses of shrivelfig
7381846 malfoy davis bulstrode crabbe goyle nott greengrass parkinson and zabini your solutions were acceptable the rest of you will write the essay class dismissed
7381847 theres no way that every single slytherin got that potion right and yours was perfect hermione
7381848 well he doesnt know it but i probably should have to do a bit of extra work after breaking into his office
7381849 heard you took the blame for that little accident in your potions class harry
7381850 oh yeah we heard about that we have our sources you see
7381851 now obviously we dont think snape is right to blame you harry
7381852 yeah ill pass along the message if i find the culprit
7381853 and you believe that old git you know hell blame harry for anything he can
7381854 whatever snape gave the ravenclaws and hufflepuffs that essay too so i suppose it isnt really harrys fault anyway were all going to meet in the library tonight to work on it together thats the only way were going to get it done by thursday you can come if you want
7381855 thanks but i have practice ill have to do it tomorrow night
7381856 im telling you its impossible to keep snape from being as bad as he can possibly be
7381857 whoever disturbed these earthworms last week caused them to get filthy
7381858 you are going to clean them so that they are once again fit to be used as ingredients however since they got dirty while enlarged they must be cleaned while enlarged
7381859 most of us have finished or at least nearly so rons still down there
7381860 youve been outside nearly three hours and having so many people fetching books really sped things up
7381861 figures for once snapes homework was a bit easier but were going to have to do it the hard way
7381862 err is it true that harrys got detention with professor snape tonight
7381863 trust me hermione you dont want to know you really dont want to know
7381864 these books are enough for you to write your essays ive marked some of the pages about shrivelfig with strips of parchment dont use anything that isnt marked because then your essay might look too much like someone elses
7381865 im only giving you what the rest of us had
7381866 harry says thanks loads maybe well get to sleep tonight
7381867 he has been petrified mr potter the same as mrs norris
7381868 yes we just found him like this in the dungeon corridor
7381869 professor vector if you would be so kind please take mr creevey to the hospital wing
7381870 miss nicholls you will assist her i will escort mr potter back to his common room safely and then i will notify the headmaster
7381871 of me been after me about it all year he asked ginny where i was and she told him we think that maybe he was in the dungeons to wait for me to come out of the potions classroom
7381872 it fits and i certainly dont have any other explanations
7381873 im sure we couldve missed it i guess we werent paying a lot of attention
7381874 all right harry come along lets get you back to the tower
7381875 dont be ridiculous harry you said hes been pursuing you for months you cant possibly control that
7381876 please fetch the first years wake them if you must
7381877 a short while ago colin creevey was attacked in the same manner as mrs norris he has been petrified
7381878 mr creevey is in the hospital wing now and he will remain there until the appropriate restorative is available we are confident that he will make a full recovery
7381879 i would remind you all that the schools curfew exists for your protection wandering the corridors after hours especially now simply is not wise i expect you all to abide by the restrictions in place and to follow any new rules we may implement in the coming days and weeks
7381880 if there is anything else you need to know i will tell you goodnight
7381881 just what she said i was on my way back from detention and i met her in the corridor colin was already petrified honestly thats all i know
7381882 si cada a o se arreglara un tramo de los cerca de 130 kil metros de costa en cinco o seis a os estar a terminado
7381883 i know youre walking and dont want you to get too hot
7381884 no se puede imputar el peso de la situaci n exclusivamente a los salarios
7381885 hay empresas que est n registrando balances con beneficios muy potentes por tanto habr que hacer sacrificios en las dos direcciones
7381886 no se puede trasladar a una persona que cobra 1 000 euros al mes porque ya est haciendo un sacrificio cada d a
7381887 me parece injusto que el sector financiero prejubile a una persona con 52 a os y que un trabajador que est en el andamio est trabajando hasta los 65 a os
7381888 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7381889 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7381890 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7381891 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7381892 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7381893 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7381894 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7381895 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7381896 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7381897 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7381898 dos medallas de plata no se consiguen todos los d as
7381899 quiero la medalla pero estar satisfecho si rindo al m ximo
7381900 quer a hacer algo en este deporte que nadie hubiese hecho antes
7381901 es la despedida so ada es perfecto estoy en una nube
7381902 lo que tenemos que hacer es celebrar una final que hemos tenido posibilidades de ganar
7381903 creo que jugamos un partido espectacular en el que nosotros con talento y con ganas respondimos a la fuerza f sica y la velocidad de estados unidos
7381904 de no ser por nuestra determinaci n y nuestras ganas no hubi ramos salido adelante mi respeto para ellos
7381905 but we acknowledge at the same time that the situation was a major change in comparison to before the games
7381906 so we believe that the games have had a good influence in that
7381907 lets not forget one thing it is not the ioc running the internet it is the chinese government running the internet
7381908 the regulations might not be perfect but they are a sea change compared to the situation before we hope that they will continue
7381909 chinese authorities agreed to establish these protest zones the same way it had been done in sydney in 2000 salt lake city in 2002 and athens in 2004
7381910 me preguntaba si no hab amos sido fieles a nuestros objetivos si el club estaba peor que hace cinco a os si pod amos comenzar la temporada sin presidente
7381911 los proyectos no llegan a buen puerto si hay un ruido excesivo no quer a llevar al club a procesos electorales
7381912 se ha sometido cuatro veces a la consulta de los socios en cinco a os
7381913 tenemos la conciencia muy tranquila y la misma ilusi n que en el 2003 pero con mucha experiencia acumulada porque las hemos pasado de todos los colores
7381914 necesitamos madurez institucional y esto se logra cuando se terminan los mandatos
7381915 algo muy profundo una decisi n para ma ana y no para hoy
7381916 si queremos que las pr ximas juntas gobiernen con estabilidad hemos de procurar que se terminen los mandatos es el mejor ejemplo que podemos dar al barcelonismo
7381917 dos medallas de plata no se consiguen todos los d as
7381918 quiero la medalla pero estar satisfecho si rindo al m ximo
7381919 quer a hacer algo en este deporte que nadie hubiese hecho antes
7381920 es la despedida so ada es perfecto estoy en una nube
7381921 los chinos est n ganando un mont n de medallas pero no nos las est n quitando a nosotros
7381922 si no se ha cambiado a n es porque cuando el debate estaba en su punto lgido a pek n le dieron los jjoo
7381923 es el mejor m todo para un pa s pobre en eeuu los atletas tienen que pagarse el entrenador aqu lo suministramos todo gratis a cambio exigimos dedicaci n exclusiva y esfuerzo desmedido
7381924 mejor que toda la mala suerte se acumule este a o en el que no lucho por nada importante seguro que ganar en este circuito como en su d a ya hice en montmel me quedan muchos a os en la f 1 para poder ganar aqu cuando est luchando nuevamente por el t tulo
7381925 ha sido un mal d a sal bastante bien y pude ganar una posici n pero en la tercera curva en la frenada sent un fuerte empuj n por detr s mir hacia atr s y vi que el aler n ya no estaba supe que deb a volver al box me qued dentro un par o tres de vueltas porque quer a volver a la pista pero ten a rota la suspensi n y el cambio
7381926 es una pena por los aficionados la gente ha venido a verme correr definitivamente es un mal d a
7381927 estoy triste y desilusionado porque en las dos carreras en espa a este a o he roto
7381928 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now
7381929 its a spirit that says we are looking for different
7381930 today we implemented a checkpoint there between approximately 9 a m and 2 p m
7381931 these types of check points have proven to be successful in the past and we are starting to utilize more checkpoints
7381932 we are expecting to begin using them frequently in and around that area and in places in jefferson and clallam counties
7381933 border patrol checkpoints are a critical tool to protect against illegal activity
7381934 we are going to continue to put them in areas where people have to pass through from point a to point b
7381935 the supervisor today said traffic was flowing along pretty good through the checkpoint
7381936 i dont believe that at any time did traffic come to standstill
7381937 we were approaching the bridge when we had to stop in a line
7381938 we assumed the bridge was open but then we saw a big sign that said there were u s officers ahead
7381939 we asked them what they were doing and the man said they were looking for someone
7381940 we arrested numerous people today and one of the people was white
7381941 we have the authority to do these checkpoints in numerous places and we will
7381942 its not just illegal immigration we are focusing on because we are reducing crime when we take a felon off the street
7381943 you wont see a border patrol agent telling doctors or lawyers how to do their jobs
7381944 but you will see people trying to tell us how to do our job even though were trained to do it
7381945 i want to live in john mccains world those were the days when men were men when the differences between good and evil were clear when they knew where they stood on every issue when life was less complicated where there was an air of insouciance no matter how difficult the issues
7381946 i want to live in a world where gen david petraeus and meg whitman former chief executive of ebay are the wisest people i know where offshore drilling will help easy our energy crisis i want to live in a world where i was absolutely certain that life begins at conception where the only thing to do with evil is defeat it
7381947 it is important to know that we are united in our determination to turning around america
7381948 and by united i mean all of us the afl cio the nea change to win 17 million members 38 million potential voters in union households

7381979 last week optus chief executive paul osullivan said telstra was holding up the nbn by not complying with its network information requirements
7381980 this confirmation demonstrates that mr osullivans claim was false and he should apologise for misleading the public
7381981 im flabbergasted that telstra is claiming optus is peddling falsehoods when you look at the history how can they have the gall to claim that the delay is our fault
7381982 the nbn taskforce has been back and forth with telstra for many months on its network information so telstra has had multiple chances to work and rework it this is a case of third or fourth time lucky for the monopolist

7382058 still able to do 95 of what i did before
7382059 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7382060 all he could do was go up to new hampshire and be john mccain
7382061 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is
7382062 the middle seat on southwest gave me a lot more opportunity to interact with voters
7382063 im not complaining still have town hall meetings still able to do 95 percent of what i did before
7382064 hes a genius this is the same coach who was laughed at in 1979 when he said that miami was on a collision course with a national championship a line hes also used at fau
7382065 while voluntary the guide represents good practice in handling breaches and i would urge all organisations to consider using it
7382066 im completely american i was born and raised in america and i love it but i think we are too quick to censor nudity
7382067 meanwhile its ok to blow things up and our films are so violent and our television is so violent
7382068 i would rather see tasteful nudity than violence any day of the week
7382069 a prioridade sair dessa situa o na tabela sul americana n o prioridade
7382070 o atl tico est na berlinda temos que lutar at o final se os jogadores ca rem n o ter o mercado ano que vem tenho o dever de ajud los

7382072 uma equipe muito forte como a do s o paulo
7382073 fizemos sondagem com ele e v rios zagueiros que n o posso ainda citar os nomes mas n o h nada definido
7382074 ele foi pego ali mesmo do est dio retirado e realiado o boletim de ocorr ncia foram tomadas todas as provid ncias cab veis para que o caso n o seja levado adiante
7382075 is totally amicable with the other girls she just wants to continue on with her solo career there is no animosity there is nothing negative
7382076 the wise woman builds up her home but the foolish woman tears it down with her own hands
7382077 he was always aiming to return for round 22 so we will see how his rehab goes
7382078 he is a good chance to play this week it was a normal hamstring injury so we hope it is only three weeks out because he is really important to us
7382079 we had disappointing losses to west coast and collingwood prior to the last two wins and obviously playing finals you want to go in feeling good about yourself
7382080 we havent looked ahead but there are a few scenarios that could occur
7382081 i havent given it the finals any thought at all really
7382082 we have got round 22 to come and while it qualifying for the finals is obviously pleasing for the club coaches tend to be so short term focused
7382083 thats how i play my footy and i pride myself on putting my body on the line when its my turn to go
7382084 its pretty sad to bring it to an end but all good things do come to an end and ive had a fantastic career i cant complain im a premiership player and life member of this club
7382085 i didnt want it to end but i did kind of
7382086 im very sore at night i just need a really good rest and i cant get comfortable at night its just an aching pain but thats footy and ive sacrificed that to get to play football
7382087 brauny was hobbling during the week and it wasnt ideal
7382088 it was one of the weeks that if it was earlier in the year he would have rested but he had a commitment to get himself up for the game and he did that
7382089 it was a great effort by him and as ive said his whole career he showed that to the end all his contests on the ground today
7382090 usually when guys play at an interstate club at some point in a 10 to 12 year career theres some speculation about when they return home
7382091 the very fact that its never come up in a debate at our footy club says a hell of a lot about the bloke i thought he was a western australian thats how heavily cemented he was in the culture of the west coast footy club
7382092 even though he hasnt been able to play the last couple of weeks he has been improving all the time
7382093 but i wouldnt risk him for a one off scenario against melbourne if we werent alive for a top eight spot its just not worth it
7382094 the guys that have got us through to this stage have done a pretty good job and they deserve to play
7382095 people were expecting so much from us last season and i think that kind of went to guys heads
7382096 now they dont expect anything from us i always liked being the underdog i hope people think were the worst team in the nation and talk bad about us every week
7382097 i can see the outside view that there is lots of inexperience
7382098 what people have overlooked is i have never seen a group of guys work harder since i have been at ucla we need to grow up and the only way to do that is by playing i feel there will be a dramatic change in every series we play from the first game and every game after that
7382099 he looks you right in the eye and tells you if he made a mistake i like that in guys
7382100 i dont know what outside expectations are nor do i care
7382101 i love it when people trash us it drives us
7382102 ive seen teams rise to levels that maybe individually you couldnt imagine
7382103 i played on a team that went to the rose bowl are starting 0 3 1 in 1983 expectations are low outside looking in not inside those are always high and we have to try to hold each other to them
7382104 the group consultation with its lenders has concluded that no proposal received to date provides acceptable outcome which is in the best interests of all relevant stakeholders it said
7382105 the group believes that in particular given current difficult capital market conditions an acceptable proposal capable of being implemented by 15 december 2008 is unlikely to be forthcoming
7382106 in the absence of a recapitalisation solution in the short term the groups objective therefore is to obtain longer term debt extensions from the lender groups beyond 15 december 2008 to provide a more stabilised environment for the recapitalisation process to be pursued over a longer time frame it said
7382107 the group has commenced discussions with the lender groups on possible terms for longer term debt extension and stabilisation of the group
7382108 it is likely that those terms would include a requirement for the conversion of a portion of debt into some form of hybrid security
7382109 this may impact the value of the groups existing ordinary equity

7382117 it was sent at 7 03 pm on saturday to a news channel which forwarded a copy to the cyber crime cell and the ats last night we worked on it and traced the internet protocol address to khalsa colleges computer laboratory
7382118 we have not recorded the statements of the students who were present in the laboratory at that time we are making preliminary inquiries and will record their statements later
7382119 one computer in the laboratory with an internet connection was switched on however the connection did not have any password and the accused might have taken advantage of this
7382120 the email is similar to several other mails sent on earlier occasions our teams are investigating the matter
7382121 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
7382122 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off

7382135 the i amp b ministry has sent us a letter advising to discontinue the we have forwarded the letter to all ibf members though we may not agree with government we have done our work of passing the information to the rest of the broadcasters
7382136 we have been actively engaged in this since the news of this kidnapping occurred
7382137 we have deployed additional staff from our mission in pretoria to our high commission in nairobi which is handling this case at a consular level

7382143 my goal was to bring myself and my personality into this project
7382144 it is the commonest cancer in india and all sexually active women are at a risk of contracting this disease but its mostly seen in woman aged between 50 to 55 years if detected at a pre cancerous stage when the cells are not normal but are not yet cancerous this cancer is 100 per cent curable
7382145 although this vaccine has proved quite effective we still need to follow up to see for how long the immunity lasts
7382146 the hpv test is ideal for the detection of cervical cancer it is slightly more accurate than the pap test but is not recommended for woman below 30 years of age

7382150 the democrats now own this war and have funded it as much as the republicans
7382151 there are some people who dont want to alienate the democratic party because theyre our best hope
7382152 the democrats own the war in iraq as much as the republicans do at this point
7382153 nobodys putting their hopes in the republicans to stop the war but a lot of people are putting false hopes in the democrats
7382154 the violence issue could lead people to go to mccain or lead people not to vote for democrats
7382155 the challenge is will we be able to collectively rise to the occasion and move beyond our individual activities to deliver a collective statement
7382156 our goal is to have everything come off as peacefully and non violently as possible
7382157 the company sees little improvement in the underlying earnings in fiscal 2009 due to uncertainty around commodity costs and future economic conditions in australia and new zealand the company said
7382158 the company is more optimistic for the fiscal 2010 year and expects to see the benefits flow through from significant capital expenditure and resulting efficiency gains combined with softening commodity prices
7382159 this quarter we will take another 200 employees out of our business he said
7382160 over the next 12 months over and above that we will probably take out another 150 to 200 employees
7382161 what you are seeing however are some shifts in the types of products that consumers are buying he said
7382162 indeed there has been a continuing migration to house brand products whether it be bread or milk or these types of related staples
7382163 that will continue at least in the short term certainly with a softening economy here and what many analysts are probably calling a recessionary economy more in new zealand

7382168 because of the cost of making the playstation 3 and because they sold it at a loss sony basically has pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3 because its lost more money than they made during the entire peak of the playstation 2 its not going to happen again for sony
7382169 if they release the playstation 4 and have an even more expensive console and raise the cost of games by ten dollars that would not be good

7382197 why experience and race i dont want to sugarcoat it
7382198 there was a lot to be said for both of them obama has the ability to inspire which is something i think this nation truly needs but hillary is a known quantity
7382199 the last couple presidential races weve had these huge issues that have drawn out people
7382200 weve got a lot of people moving in who are commuting to the cities and tend to be a little more conservative voters
7382201 we walked into the room and you could just feel the energy
7382202 every since then i was like this guys got something special
7382203 its shocking but ive been surprised at the number of people ive encountered around here who will say im not ready to vote for a black person
7382204 i like his position on national security primarily and the fact that hes pro life
7382205 i think hes an inexperienced guy trying to fill a position that hes really not qualified for
7382206 the fact that his father was a muslim and he was raised muslim in his early childhood years that plays a factor
7382207 any president i vote for has to be a christian i dont think its a prejudice so much its just that i think our values are different
7382208 obama i think still fluctuates because hes on a learning curve
7382209 but once youre in it you have to deal with the cards that you are dealt and i think mccains probably the best one to bring it to a reasonable ending
7382210 i think they should both be on the ticket i think wed have the best of both worlds
7382211 if he doesnt get in that will be the only reason
7382212 hes just a new and a different face and people are sort of swooning
7382213 there is no excuse for party elites who believe they have more power than the grassroots
7382214 if we allow that to continue our freedoms are taken away from us and we are ruled by a group of elitists
7382215 i didnt know exactly where he stood on some of the value issues
7382216 the way he answered those questions it showed a depth of character to me that i hadnt realized before
7382217 he also answered them very straight forward no hesitation as to what he believed
7382218 i think he is very intelligent a very moving speaker
7382219 i think he believes in socialism and wants to move the country to become a socialist country
7382220 i want to live in john mccains world those were the days when men were men when the differences between good and evil were clear when they knew where they stood on every issue when life was less complicated where there was an air of insouciance no matter how difficult the issues
7382221 i want to live in a world where gen david petraeus and meg whitman former chief executive of ebay are the wisest people i know where offshore drilling will help easy our energy crisis i want to live in a world where i was absolutely certain that life begins at conception where the only thing to do with evil is defeat it
7382222 we intend to have hundreds of bikes available in the weeks leading up to the rnc and carry the energy over for a community bike shop after the rnc is dead and gone from this land
7382223 as a health benefits company focused on sustainability it works for us for a lot of different reasons
7382224 so people can make connections to our trails and streets with bike lanes
7382225 the bigger chunk is trying to make a real bike share happen in minneapolis by next may
7382226 in order to have things be anything beyond recreational well have to have an advanced network
7382227 bringing those 1 000 bikes will capture the imagination of the city
7382228 whether those bikes end up being part of the system is an open question
7382229 will have a lot of value to a lot of people
7382230 theres potential for hundreds of bikers throughout city to be using something like this
7382231 the whole idea is for people to use bikes for short trips for utilitarian purposes
7382232 by now all of them have disappeared and thats what happened in every city
7382233 at the same time paris did that they made infrastructure improvements they had policy changes they basically opened up many corridors
7382234 the whole strategy is to favor pedestrian and bicycle transport so you give bicycles and pedestrian advantages over motorists
7382235 you give them shortcuts on a one way street you allow two way for bicycles you provide as much space as you can
7382236 where transportation planners acknowledge that bicycling is a social activity so they want to have bike lanes wide enough to accommodate bicycles two abreast with room for third to pass
7382237 i think somebody will have to say yeah this has become a priority were going to make downtown as bicycle friendly as possible
7382238 whats being neglected in my mind is the concept of routine accommodation
7382239 whenever a street is being improved they should automatically re stripe it to include a bike lane
7382240 we are but its not because we dont share the same enthusiasm minneapolis does our issue is that st paul is designed differently than minneapolis we dont have a chain of lakes infrastructure that can be the hub of bike routes to spoke out from its more complicated in st paul
7382241 you need a full time bike coordinator to take on projects like this
7382242 i am so glad so happy after such a bad result in hungary and the way it ended there said massa
7382243 everyone did a fantastic job for me and it is a great result for the team to take pole to win the race and to clock the fastest lap you cannot ask for more than that after such a bad experience in budapest
7382244 as far as i am concerned i did nothing wrong it is more about adrian sutil than me
7382245 we have great reliability and a great package and no worries about any of that he said adding that he felt pain from his neck throughout the race
7382246 i woke up early on saturday morning and had a spasm in my neck hamilton explained
7382247 at one point i did not think i would recover and be able to race but i had injections and i made it
7382248 i felt it during the race and it was tough for me but i dont think i lost any time the team had pedro de la rosa the reserve driver waiting to race and of course he wanted to because he is spanish
7382249 i felt bad from the start of the weekend with low energy fevers every day and the spasms in my neck luckily i have a great doctor and trainer and we got through it
7382250 it came back after a little while but i lost confidence and it affected me he said
7382251 we got this third because of our great qualifying performance on saturday
7382252 we need knife river to get serious about negotiating before even more hard working men and women in minnesota and across the country are subjected to the same discriminatory working environments
7382253 a tear and prayer filled van damme monologue that must be seen to be believed
7382254 i contribute emphasis mine this directly to a rapid decline in bible teaching resulting in the break up of the family unit the anchor of a society
7382255 so i guess terris never gonna speak to you again
7382256 but seriously he doesnt have a clue what the bible says and yet he pretends to be a church going christian to win votes that is sooooo evil
7382257 to lie about being a believer in christ is very dangerous lightning could strike him at any minute
7382258 i know my stance might keep me from la jobs
7382259 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding he wrote in an excerpt which appeared in britains
7382260 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7382261 and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7382262 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7382263 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire he wrote
7382264 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions its unlikely crickets governing body the icc can open an investigation into alleged ball tampering the newspaper added former england batsman marcus trescothick has admitted to illegally shining the ball by sucking on breath fresheners during the 2005 ashes series the virtually unplayable reverse swing generated by pace bowlers simon jones and andrew flintoff which was crucial to england amp squo s ashes triumph over australia may have been caused by murray mints which as with other artificial substances is illegal the saliva from these mints aided swinging trescothick wrote in his autobiography amp squo coming back to me amp squo aussies lose ashes to murry mints lucky england wasnt
7382265 we come from mali where the north side is desert and the south a very small part is green
7382266 habib is unique because he brings together different styles creating a new pan malian approach that reflects his open minded interest in all types of music
7382267 its not right to sit for a concert thats meant for dancing
7382268 music is all around us if only we had ears there would be no need for concert halls
7382269 prophesy to these bones and say to them dry bones hear the word of the lord
7382270 prophesy to the breath prophesy son of man and say to it this is what the sovereign lord says come from the four winds o breath and breathe into these slain that they may live
7382271 son of man these bones are the whole house of israel they say our bones are dried up and our hope is gone we are cut off
7382272 you are young and life is long and there is time to kill today and then one day you find ten years have got behind you no one told you when to run you missed the starting gun
7382273 i wanted to tell you how serious i am about us but i thought to do this would be a bit more well romantic
7382274 estoy muy satisfecho con el resultado me qued muy cerca de hacer mi mejor marca personal que apenas hice en el campeonato mundial de este a o y creo que esto es el indicio de que el pr ximo ciclo ol mpico puede ser a n mejor para el pentatl n moderno mexicano

7382290 it was karl barth i believe who said that trying to make the gospel relevant to the contemporary age was like running after the train that has just left
7382291 the most serious mistake of theological attempts to understand the age is the assumption that the gospel could somehow be made to appear relevant to old beings
7382292 no c mo crees nunca voy a celebrar siempre ustedes saben que le tengo un gran cari o tengo dos equipos con los que nunca puedo celebrar el am rica y veracruz y met gol pero no quise celebrar porque le tengo un gran cari o a la gente y un respeto m s que nada

7382296 muy importante marcar tres goles pero ahora hay que seguir trabajando luego que ya conseguimos el primer triunfo del torneo
7382297 este resultado es vital porque ven amos de tres derrotas y un empate por lo que ahora debemos trabajar bastante en la semana para mejorar en nuestro juego
7382298 sab amos que necesit bamos un triunfo para poder empezar a resurgir ya que lo tenemos debemos continuar por ese camino y corregir muchos aspectos
7382299 fue un juego en que tuvimos la ventaja no supimos manejar bien los tiempos y por descuidos nuestros al final a bal n parado no pudimos llevarnos los tres puntos en casa
7382300 hay que manejar mucho la cuesti n mental a la hora de ir ganando le cedimos la iniciativa al contrario le dejamos bastantes espacios a jugadores de la calidad y velocidad con los que cuentan
7382301 pudimos haber hecho m s goles pero cuando nos empataron salimos a buscar el partido corriendo el riesgo de que nos pudieran agarrar de contragolpe como lo hicieron despu s se hizo m s dificil empatar por que su gol fue sobre la hora
7382302 no nos queda mas que seguir trabajando hay cosas que est n bien pero hay muchas otras por mejorar y hay que trabajar en base a eso
7382303 un gran equipo y no le vamos a restar m ritos perdimos contra un gran equipo
7382304 tanto el pitcheo como el bateo de diablos respondieron a la hora oportuna tuvieron un gran pitcheo ellos y hay que reconocer
7382305 hoy me parece que el partido con todo respeto por jaguares y por la instituci n pero me parece que lo perdi el am rica no es normal que en un plantel con tanta jerarqu a se comentan estos errores
7382306 me parece que el equipo no est como para perder puntos y menos dar mucha ventaja hoy dejamos escapar una gran oportunidad de ponernos arriba en puntos pero vamos a revertirlo
7382307 el partido lo divido en dos partes lo que es el primer tiempo me parece que hemos hecho el mejor desde que estamos con mucho ritmo determinaci n y mucho juego hemos cometido algunos errores en el segundo tiempo no es lo que queremos y no es lo que hemos trabajado no es el arranque que quer amos
7382308 estoy muy contento porque muchos jugadores han respondido de la mejor manera hay algunas ausencias importantes que las vamos a tratar de recuperar pero que la gente sepa que mi intenci n es jugar como lo hicimos en el primer tiempo lo del segundo lo vamos a corregir por que me parece que fuimos muy ingenuos

7382311 esta es una sugerencia personal presidente necesitamos que nos escuchen a los atletas porque muchos de nosotros tenemos cosas que decir y que aportar al deporte nacional
7382312 no podemos seguir teniendo personas que no se han empapado la camiseta nacional como nosotros
7382313 queremos aclarar al pueblo venezolano que algunos hicieron falsas expectativas sobre nuestra participaci n en beijing y nosotros fuimos a pelear por estar en lo m s alto de podio estar entre las medallas sin embargo no se lograron los objetivos

7382322 hay que resaltar la actitud y el deseo de ganar de los jugadores mi equipo jug muy bien tengo muy buenos elementos se comportaron a la altura y estuvieron bastante atentos
7382323 puede ser am rica es un equipo muy importante en m xico y en el mundo est muy bien dirigido y tiene grandes jugadores entonces si vienes a ganarle a este equipo y m s en el azteca vamos a tomarlo como un buen partido principalmente en el segundo tiempo y tratar de mejorar de manera m s prolongada durante los 90 minutos

7382334 weve had three applicants just this week having trouble paying their co pays
7382335 theyve identified a pea size region in the brain that reacts more strongly to faces than it does to cars dogs houses or body parts the evidence is overwhelming that there is a specialized system dedicated to processing faces and not other objects
7382336 i get by with a little help from my friends
7382337 the crimes for which the accused is paying the penalty today demonstrate that the gesture extended to them was not justified and that it led to the killing of additional innocent citizens the danger posed by the accused was clear after he had already been convicted of murder in the past the need to keep them at a distance from human civilization forever was also self evident after his release the accused demonstrated that the gesture was unjustified and the steep price for this was paid by many israeli families

7382343 sunflowers can be raised in odd places they will grow very good heads without cultivation and for this reason can be grown in fence corners and places where nothing else can be raised to advantage the seeds are very rich and will make the plumage of the fowls bright as well as increase the number of eggs and all they cost is the planting of the seed and the gathering of the heads
7382344 soft snow like mist that uses the natural deodorizing qualities of astringent persimmon and grapefruit
7382345 on the other hand the names that the accused are revealing may not ring a bell for the police it is quite possible that the person may be the same but the police and the accused know him by different names they have given themselves fake names for different purposes and are known by various aliases so it is possible that police is looking for the same person that the accused are mentioning but are finding it difficult to arrive at his real identity if photos are not available
7382346 we are exploring if those persons in custody of ahmedabad police are involved in the hyderabad blasts too or they know of the persons who were involved so far the names or links are not falling into place
7382347 the dozen odd persons arrested by the ahmedabad police also had given themselves aliases and throughout the operation they were known by that name only those who were involved in the operation did not know the real names of each other even during the training camps held in kerala and gujarat where persons from various states attended they had fake names in cases where we dont have the suspects sketch or photograph it is difficult to pin point who is who
7382348 allow ourselves a little bit more leeway in terms of sculpting the sound in the studio and doing overdubs and using the studio as another instrument last time around it was more of a document

7382353 it is appalling to me that people still want to invoke my fathers name five years after his death to ascribe beliefs ideals values and loyalties to him that cannot possibly be determined and to try to further their own agendas by doing so
7382354 i would ask that my father not be co opted in this election for either side since he is clearly not here to defend or state his own allegiance

7382407 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7382408 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7382409 i know that we had a tough road ahead of us we knew that these guys werent going to roll over and give up that easily
7382410 so we had to be men and thats what it takes to win
7382411 being a part of the 04 team we really didnt get the opportunity to showcase our talent
7382412 we really wanted to come in and help lead this team
7382413 we knew coming in that spain was going to be a big problem
7382414 had we not been together for three years we might have cracked
7382415 individuals might have gone one on one that wouldve been the tendency the continuity paid off
7382416 everyone wants to talk about nba players as arrogant as selfish
7382417 we all complain on our teams that i want to play with this player or that one
7382418 well here weve got them all this is how its supposed to be
7382419 a lot of people doubted that nba stars could play together
7382420 its very difficult for us because major league baseball is very big business and a lot of players that have potential to play in the big leagues theyre either called up or not allowed to come here
7382421 i think thatd be great but i think thats a decision that major league baseball would have to make
7382422 now that we have the world baseball classic i dont see them probably doing that
7382423 but baseball is such a big business in the united states its the off season in basketball if it was during the nba season id be amazed if they let em come
7382424 the officer told katherine to pick up the butt and throw it away in the trash 10 feet away
7382425 he added that hed fine her next time he catches her tossing trash on the sidewalk
7382426 when i had the honor of introducing the person who i believe will be the next and one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7382427 the american people are anxious right now times are tough its not just peoples imaginations
7382428 hes very charismatic he has wisdom hes well educated and hes ready to pick up the middle class
7382429 this is a once in a lifetime opportunity especially if hes going to be our next president
7382430 ive been for him since day one since he declared
7382431 this is the best time to catch a politician right before lunch
7382432 secret service protection for my two girls as they enter their teenage years
7382433 theyre going to try to scare the heck out of you
7382434 because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out
7382435 its not that katies bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as sweet little joey potter
7382436 ha sido mi victoria m s bonita sin duda ten a claro que era vital salir de esta segunda carrera manteniendo las opciones al t tulo he intentado una maniobra arriesgada para sorprenderles y colocarme primero de forma r pida y me ha salido bien luego he podido controlar tanto a oliver como a brendon hasta la meta quedan dos carreras y sin duda quiero luchar por el t tulo

7382438 austereo is uniquely placed through its current leading ratings and sales share to capitalise on future advertising market uplift chief executive michael anderson said
7382439 in tighter economic conditions radio outperformed total metropolitan media in part due to its flexibility cost efficiency and targeted audience reach he said
7382440 for the july to december 2008 half we believe that capital city radio growth will be in positive territory in a range below three per cent he said
7382441 in the past year combined radio and online advertising campaigns have almost doubled he said
7382442 the company sees little improvement in the underlying earnings in fiscal 2009 due to uncertainty around commodity costs and future economic conditions in australia and new zealand goodman fielder said
7382443 the company is more optimistic for the fiscal 2010 year and expects to see the benefits flow through from significant capital expenditure and resulting efficiency gains combined with softening commodity prices
7382444 substantial and rapid increases in commodity costs impacted margins and added 204 million to its costs
7382445 in the second half of the year international crude oil pricing also reached record high levels resulting in an increase of 30 million in logistics costs it added
7382446 a rapid deterioration in the new zealand economy towards the end of the financial year also impacted earnings as did the weakening new zealand dollar
7382447 this was the first time in the last five years in which the business did not record double digit profit growth goodman said
7382448 the dairy business had a difficult year with rapidly escalating commodity costs resulting in raw milk costs increasing by over 60 per cent in the year goodman said
7382449 aggressive cost recovery initiatives resulted in the business taking four price rises but inevitable timing lags and a growth in private label sales had a negative impact on margins
7382450 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
7382451 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
7382452 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
7382453 underlying eps earnings per share grew strongly by 12 5 per cent and we are confident this performance provides a clear path for delivering improved results in full year 2009 and beyond chief executive jo farnik said
7382454 following the completion of our strategic review and the identification of opportunities for growth and improved efficiency we undertook deliberate investment in restructuring and this has and will continue to deliver strong financial returns mr farnik said
7382455 we come from mali where the north side is desert and the south a very small part is green
7382456 habib is unique because he brings together different styles creating a new pan malian approach that reflects his open minded interest in all types of music
7382457 its not right to sit for a concert thats meant for dancing
7382458 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether barack obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7382459 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7382460 joe biden believes the war was a mistake john mccain would still do it all over again joe biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years if barack obama and joe biden had set iraq policy these last six years rather than george bush and john mccain we wouldnt be in the hole were in today
7382461 the president always has the right to act preemptively if we are in imminent danger if they are coming up over the hill he can respond if troops are coming out of tijuana heading north we can respond if they are coming down from toronto we can respond if missiles are on their way we can respond but that is not the way i hear it being used here we are talking about preemption as if we are adopting a policy
7382462 the power of the purse is useless because it presents us with a hobsons choice
7382463 we have our fighting men and women in place and we are told by the way the president will not take them home so lets cut off the support for them so they have no guns no bullets no ability to fight a war and no one is willing to do that
7382464 theres lucky felipe arcila a four year old boy born without half his heart he would have died in 10 days if not for our miracle workers then theres little adrian keller the boy with fused ribs and a question mark shaped spine hes terminally ill but with the help of these doctors he might just have a chance to stand tall
7382465 look for the fed and paulson to take steps on fannie and freddie the time is ripe the market wants resolution here
7382466 there are a lot of cross currents here youve got oil financials and politics coming together and its hard to see that combining in a way thats a perfect storm to the downside or a perfect environment to the upside
7382467 i think its important that the week ahead is the last week in august and so whatever happens we should take it with a grain of salt
7382468 what weve been saying about housing is just show us some stability were looking for a silver lining

7382470 i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life
7382471 i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation
7382472 so the fact is that we have homes and im grateful for it we spend our time primarily in washington d c where i have a condominium in crystal city va here in this beautiful sedona that i am blessed every moment that i can spend here our condominium in phoenix ariz and a place over in san diego the others are also for investment purposes
7382473 we tried to inject some humor in some of ours which i think were quite effective and entertaining for people but thats a judgment the american people will make
7382474 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7382475 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7382476 a lot of the verbiage on ancestral domain in the moa ad comes verbatim
7382477 relationship between the central government and the bje bangsamoro juridical entity shall be associative characterized by shared authority and responsibility

7382479 the dominant paradigm within which social scientists assess natural resource issues
7382480 has been embraced as a sacred text by scholars and professionals in the practice of designing futures for others and imposing their own economic and environmental rationality on other social systems of which they have incomplete understanding and knowledge
7382481 the rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd
7382482 t he use of arable and meadowlands was under the supervision and direction of the community
7382483 just as the share of each member in so much of the mark as was distributed was of equal size so was his share also in the use of the common mark the nature of this use was determined by the members of the community as a whole
7382484 at fixed times and if necessary more frequently they met in the open air to discuss the affairs of the mark and to sit in judgment upon breaches of regulations and disputes concerning the mark
7382485 w hat existed in fact was not a tragedy of the commons but rather a triumph that for hundreds of years and perhaps thousands although written records do not exist to prove the longer era land was managed successfully by communities
7382486 it is to be expected that each herdsman will try to keep as many cattle as possible on the commons as a rational being each herdsman seeks to maximize his gain
7382487 we must admit that our legal system of private property plus inheritance is unjust but we put up with it because we are not convinced at the moment that anyone has invented a better system the alternative of the commons is too horrifying to contemplate injustice is preferable to total ruin
7382488 t he entire spirit of capitalist production which is oriented towards the most immediate monetary profits stands in contradiction to agriculture which has to concern itself with the whole gamut of permanent conditions of life required by the chain of human generations a striking illustration of this is furnished by the forests which are only rarely managed in a way more or less corresponding to the interests of society as a whole
7382489 hardins fable was taken up by the gathering forces of neo liberal reaction in the 1970s and his essay became the scientific foundation of world bank and imf policies viz enclosure of commons and privatization of public property the message is clear we must never treat the earth as a common treasury we must be ruthless and greedy or else we will perish
7382490 t hese large amounts of land with their attendant natural resources will never yield their maximum benefit to canadas native people as long as they are held as collective property subject to political management collective property is the path of poverty and private property is the path of prosperity

7382494 law and disorder gives listeners access to rare legal perspectives on issues concerning civil liberties privacy right to dissent and the horrendous practices of torture exercised by the us government
7382495 a petition for rehearing will not succeed by simply parroting the dissent
7382496 if making an argument is not a great day in your life dont make it and if it is give it everything in you
7382497 the advocate should give the argument not because his client expects it or because his stature in the firm demands it but simply because he cannot imagine anything that he would rather do if he is able to think of something he would rather do he should go and do it

7382513 i was born with a wrench in my pocket and a desire to build trucks
7382514 i wanted to spend more time with my children than farming allows and for me building trucks is a great alternative to milking
7382515 some people think that our lifestyle smothers the children and keeps them from the secular world
7382516 but they are free to choose the kinds of work where they will be happiest and it is good to know that they will go into the world with strong values skills and good work ethics
7382517 we like to start them out in a sheltered greenhouse environment and set them out into the sun and the storms as they are ready
7382518 the group consultation with its lenders has concluded that no proposal received to date provides acceptable outcome which is in the best interests of all relevant stakeholders it said
7382519 the group believes that in particular given current difficult capital market conditions an acceptable proposal capable of being implemented by 15 december 2008 is unlikely to be forthcoming
7382520 in the absence of a recapitalisation solution in the short term the groups objective therefore is to obtain longer term debt extensions from the lender groups beyond 15 december 2008 to provide a more stabilised environment for the recapitalisation process to be pursued over a longer time frame it said
7382521 the group has commenced discussions with the lender groups on possible terms for longer term debt extension and stabilisation of the group
7382522 it is likely that those terms would include a requirement for the conversion of a portion of debt into some form of hybrid security
7382523 this may impact the value of the groups existing ordinary equity

7382614 si jugamos al nivel que podemos pasaremos la eliminatoria ag ero llega con la moral muy alta y transmite al grupo su hambre de victoria
7382615 soy el mismo de siempre cuando salgo a la pista no lo hago pensando si soy el n mero uno o el n mero dos un puesto en el que he sido muy feliz durante los ltimos tres a os
7382616 estuve trabajando muy duro para intentar estar preparado para cuando este momento llegara
7382617 estoy muy feliz de ser el n mero uno es una enorme satisfacci n despu s de estar tanto tiempo en el dos pero nada cambia
7382618 la presi n es la misma ahora que hace tres semanas cuando quieres ganar el objetivo y la presi n son los mismos
7382619 seguir progresando y mejorando en mi tenis y seguir jugando bien en los torneos es el nico objetivo
7382620 jugar bien aqu es una gran motivaci n tengo confianza en intentar seguir en la l nea de los ltimos torneos s que ser complicado porque aqu est n los mejores del mundo y yo llevo muchos partidos a mis espaldas pero espero estar listo para el reto es el ltimo grand slam de la temporada y es importante para todos si hago un buen resultado tendr mis opciones de estar en el n mero uno por m s tiempo
7382621 s que es dif cil mantener el n mero uno y que puedo volver a ser el dos o incluso el tres en los pr ximos meses pero hay que estar preparado para todo intentar disfrutar del momento porque no puedo jugar durante toda mi carrera como lo he estado haciendo los ltimos seis meses y aceptar lo que venga todo deportista tiene buenos y malos momentos hace seis meses todo el mundo se preguntaba porqu no ganaba t tulos y ahora mismo estoy atravesando la mejor fase de mi carrera as es el deporte y hay que aceptarlo con la misma humildad de siempre porque nunca sabes qu ser lo siguiente
7382622 cuando uno est jugando bien como es su caso se siente c modo en cualquier superficie desde miami estoy jugando bien en todas las pistas aunque en el pasado tampoco me fue tan mal en pista dura lograr buenos resultados es una muy buena not cia
7382623 siempre se aprenden cosas y ha sido importante en mi vida en el tenis somos muy afortunados porque todo es muy profesional no sucede lo mismo en otros deportes y entonces ves que para esos deportistas no es f cil ha sido extraordinario estar ah comiendo al tiempo que otros 6 000 atletas de todos los rincones del mundo ha sido incre ble
7382624 si has seguido la f1 durante a os sabr s que no es la primera vez que pasa algo parecido a la salida de boxes
7382625 no fue peligrosa s lo inesperada porque los dos salimos muy juntos pero le dej pasar en esos momentos iba l der y no quer a arriesgar
7382626 sobre todo despu s del desastre de hungr a este fin de semana el equipo ha hecho un gran trabajo
7382627 eso nos preocupa porque en ferrari nunca hemos tenido problemas de fiabilidad y ahora los hemos sufrido en dos carreras seguidas necesitamos trabajar muy duro para saber qu ha pasado y estar concentrados para resolver cualquier problema que se nos plantee de ahora en adelante
7382628 ahora m s que nunca tengo que ir paso a paso no estoy preocupado por haber perdido el n mero uno rafa ha jugado incre ble merece ese puesto voy a concentrarme en lo que puedo controlar y veremos c mo va
7382629 rafa sentir ahora lo que yo he sentido durante mucho tiempo todo el mundo ha esperado durante casi cinco a os que ganara cada torneo que he jugado ahora ese papel le corresponde a l incluso en pista dura donde ha obtenido muy buenos resultados
7382630 ser interesante ver c mo se maneja en esta situaci n
7382631 para recuperar el n mero uno y para empezar espero ganar este torneo
7382632 este a o necesito su apoyo y quiz ellos me lleven hacia otra victoria

7382637 trillions for military technology how the pentagon innovates and why it costs so much
7382638 why it takes decades to get them into production even as innovation in the civilian economy becomes ever more frenetic and why some of those weapons dont work very well despite expenditures of many billions of dollars
7382639 the internal politics of the armed services make weapons acquisition almost unmanageable

7382646 so poor was he that it is told that his son wesley was bound out to strangers at that time he was given a slip of paper with his name and birth written on it i have often seen this slip but it has become lost or misplaced
7382647 he followed closely the general course of the ohio river to its mouth and ascended the mississippi to its junction with the missouri river
7382648 crossing the mississippi on a log raft of his own construction he proceeded up the missouri river to a point near the location of where kansas city now stands the greater part of the country through which he passed was at that time little explored he experienced many hardships and privations and contended with wild animals and savage indian tribes through whose country his course led he finally returned safely to his ohio home and family
7382649 indian dave was the last person to see chief lion alive
7382650 he was standing by the side of a large sycamore tree about 200 yards distant and grandfather had seen him through the sights of old betsy his faithful rifle
7382651 the last time he was seen alive he was fishing from the breast of the old dam near his home on the tuscarawas river
7382652 he either fell from the dam and was drowned or was killed by an indian the supposition at the time was that he was killed by an indian out of revenge his remains when recovered were badly decomposed and was buried on the river bank near the place of discovery

7382655 pastor lewis and his church members were ordered to stop not because there was some ordinance they were violating or that the noise rose to the level of disorderly conduct but because the police were concerned that the persons hearing the message might react against it
7382656 this appears to be a classic case of a hecklers veto which is unconstitutional
7382657 whether we agree with all of the message of pastor lewis and his followers is irrelevant

7382681 at this defining moment in our history with our nation at war our economy in recession we know that the american people can not afford four more years of the same failed policies and the same old politics in washington

7382695 hemos elaborado una nueva ley de servicio militar cuyo esp ritu es motivar a los j venes peruanos a enrolarse en cualquiera de las instituciones de las fuerzas armadas ya sea en el servicio activo acuartelado o no acuartelado y tambi n otorgar mecanismos de participaci n a los padres de familia para supervisar el respeto y buen trato que deben recibir sus hijos cuando sirvan a la patria no obstante estos hechos no s lo perjudican la imagen de la entidad sino desmotivan a los padres a enviar a sus hijos a servir activamente e inclusive en no acuartelado modalidad en la que se encontraba la recluta raymondi baz n

7382697 i did not want to be stuck in a dry as dust teaching job
7382698 in those days that was the only option for a history student apart from research of course
7382699 a graduate in history can be anything from a civil servant to a curator to a heritage manager he or she can also become a numismatist or a librarian
7382700 nothing can beat the satisfaction of taking good care of artifacts which are a little bit of history themselves in fact it is these things of daily use that give a proper perspective of the times that have gone by
7382701 to get a real feel for the subject students should work on at least one excavation
7382702 heritage managers take care of buildings or even whole neighbourhoods that are special because of their age they can also be in charge of archaeological sites whether open to the public or otherwise
7382703 those in the administrative service need to be aware of the past to successfully handle present problems
7382704 if you have historic perspective you can analyse a situation better in fact i learnt to think analytically in my history classes in college
7382705 i can think of at least three people off the top of my head who were recruited by reputed newspapers during campus placement
7382706 you cannot really analyse the present if you do not know the past
7382707 our teaching methodology helps history students to gather and sort through information quickly
7382708 but it is actually not so apart from art history we also have the history of science unfortunately it is not the historians but the scientists who have taken the trouble to maintain it
7382709 the students of this course normally go on to work with environmental ngos
7382710 las muestras estar n congeladas por ocho a os en el futuro se puede descubrir lo que no se haya descubierto hoy eso tambi n es disuasivo
7382711 sin duda saldr n m s casos despu s del cierre de los juegos ol mpicos
7382712 no creo que haya un sistema que no conozcamos hoy en d a cuando hay algo de este tipo siempre nos enteramos no creo en nada m gico en todo caso si hubiera algo que no haya sido detectado ser buscado y al final lo detectaremos
7382713 tuvimos 12 positivos en sydney 2000 y 26 en atenas 2004 una extrapolaci n para beijing te lleva a entre 30 y 40 casos
7382714 creemos que tuvimos menos casos por el efecto disuasivo aumentamos de 3 500 a 4 500 los controles y tambi n las penas aquellos que reciban una sanci n de m s de seis meses quedan suspendidos para los juegos siguientes
7382715 y no hay que olvidar que tuvimos 39 casos en el mes previo a los juegos probablemente haya que incluir esa cifra en el balance final
7382716 por supuesto que este tipo de actitud es una medida extrema y pone en riesgo a los pacientes sobre todo cuando es una huelga del ministerio de salud donde se atienden la gente m s pobre del pa s esto siempre tiene un impacto negativo en esta poblaci n y su derecho a la atenci n
7382717 la ley de trabajo m dico expresa que los m dicos tienen la obligaci n de laborar seis horas diarias o 36 horas a la semana y dice que son cuatro horas continuas en consultorio de atenci n y dos en investigaci n o docencia pero lo que ahora se establece es que todas las horas se dediquen al paciente
7382718 estoy satisfecho y agradecido con la declaraci n del presidente bush
7382719 tendremos revisiones t cnicas a partir de enero del a o pr ximo pues el cronograma de itv ser publicado la primera semana de diciembre los citv podr n tener plantas m viles para localidades donde no se haya autorizado un operador de planta fija
7382720 esto significa que el equipamiento de sus plantas y condiciones del servicio ser n evaluadas por el mtc de acuerdo con los requisitos del nuevo reglamento significa tambi n que deber cerrar sus plantas hasta que el mtc las autorice y que la presunta exigibilidad arg ida recientemente por lidercon se torne inaplicable pues el mtc fija el cronograma
7382721 el martes vamos a ver el reglamento y el plan de trabajo en el que hemos recogido los temas pendientes que han quedado de la anterior legislatura como es el caso del banco de materiales a n falta bastante y por eso se pidi 45 d as m s para concluir los estudios correspondientes
7382722 se tiene que buscar un punto de equilibrio entre el estado y las comunidades nativas
7382723 desde de la perspectiva del estado los recursos naturales son patrimonio de la naci n es decir de todos pero desde el punto de vista hist rico hay derechos ancestrales de las poblaciones ind genas se tiene que buscar un punto de equilibrio hay que pensar en el conjunto del pa s sin dejar de lado las necesidades de las comunidades
7382724 lo interesante es que exista la posibilidad de llegar a puntos de encuentro que impliquen modernizaci n y la posibilidad de mayor tecnolog a y condiciones de vida eso pasa por criterios de inversi n pero tambi n por ciertos niveles de participaci n y de consenso

7382728 thank you for nature and this nature way of living thank you for giving me everything i want
7382729 we think that we can do a lot better in patients who have traumatic pain and thats why were focussing on those people
7382730 once weve undertaken the analysis well then take those findings to our respective medical standards committees
7382731 were a small little bit disappointed but he behaved impeccably all through the fights
7382732 i hope im after doing them all proud at home
7382733 kenny is carrying on the tradition of all the great irish boxers going back to the thirties
7382734 he has nothing to be ashamed of he is now ranked number two in the world
7382735 it was just like this all the bunting on the road everything
7382736 i just thought he looked a bit upset himself and that upset me
7382737 hell be a bit down i suppose but as far as im concerned he done the business
7382738 itll be a very boring life when all this is over
7382739 we are very excited to be coming to new zealand for the first time to tour and i am really looking forward to seeing the country and finally having the opportunity to play for the fans
7382740 this is the first time weve heard of a split for patriotic reasons
7382741 i know records are made to be broken but i dont think anyone will ever win 200 races again
7382742 it gives me a chance to get my product out in front of a lot of people
7382743 everybody loves hot sauce here i dont have to warn people
7382744 we hope the search will be a positive uniting experience for the board
7382745 we hope you have as much success with your selection as we believe you had with the selection last time
7382746 its cool thinking all of that didnt go into the trash
7382747 the number one reason we do this is to prevent all this stuff from going into a landfill
7382748 w hy should i be responsible for paying for joe bidens brain aneurysms
7382749 they kept telling me push push push that was fun a lot of fun
7382750 oh my god this is awesome weve been close so often we never lost faith this is great for detroit
7382751 im very proud weve done as well as we have i had to be here today its such a momentous occasion
7382752 when it comes to the olympics theyre just brilliant they bring out the best in everyone theyre just such a happy event
7382753 it means a lot that london has them its something to be proud of instead of just moaning about the country its time to strike out and show what we can do
7382754 were not going to be able to compete with all the amazing graphics beijing has done but in our own way it will be equally good
7382755 if we can maintain that funding and get more investment that would be great
7382756 the more people start thinking positively and start promoting the london olympics as a positive thing the more successful theyre going to be
7382757 theyre going to be good for business good for development and infrastructure in the long term there will be all the facilities which we wouldnt have if we didnt have the olympics
7382758 its a once in a lifetime thing for it to be in my country im so very proud
7382759 we should be positive weve waited for years for it to come back people just need to get behind it and support their country
7382760 the tube is already so crowded i cant imagine it then with all the tourists coming over it will be a nightmare
7382761 the world is losing the war i think at the moment they the taliban definitely have the upper hand
7382762 the issue which is not just a bad case scenario as far as pakistan is concerned or as afghanistan is concerned but it is going to be spreading further the whole world is going to be affected by it
7382763 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days we will cherish forever
7382764 the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world
7382765 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness

7382768 we had cause to write metro digital and its alter ego mr john nwafor in respect of the piracy of our sporting channels
7382769 the signals to the epl matches meant for the mid east territory were illegally down linked by the use of showtime smart cards purchased in the mid east and re transmitted to subscribers in the port harcourt onitsha and asaba areas of the country by metro digital
7382770 on further noncompliance by metro digital antipiracy enforcement raids were conducted by the ncc on the premises of metro digital
7382771 invaded the broadcast stations of metro digital limited in port harcourt on december 30th 2007 using about 25 armed policemen rented from a local police station without a court order or search warrants as required by the nigeria law they vandalized the facility using knives and pliers to cut transmission lines from transmitters and damaged almost everything that has any value at the broadcast station they left no information on why they vandalized the facility they also carried away most of the damaged equipment
7382772 hitv has already paid them and gave them the instruction not to release our equipment to prevent us from getting back to air to service our subscribers
7382773 they insisted that i must write a statement before i will go this is probably what they published in the newspaper as arrest to damage my name
7382774 they used a total of about 60 armed policemen and some hired thugs for maximum intimidation
7382775 they vandalized and destroyed everything they can find at the broadcast stations again without warrant or court order as required by the nigeria law because of the level of corruption in the country they have been getting away with things like this
7382776 the court also issued an order against ncc on the 16th may directing them to return all the equipment they damaged and carted away
7382777 hitv did not and would not bribe any organization or government official to protect its rights or investments
7382778 there is therefore no iota of truth in the complaint forwarded by mr nwafor as he is deviously and deceitfully attempting to cover up the truth as regards his criminal activities mr john nwafors company operates a pay tv business that thrives on pirated programmes
7382779 christies 2007 sale which totaled 14 567 975 confirmed its position as the world leader in spanish art sales this unique category of art is securing record prices year after year the spanish team is looking forward to building on their previous success with the 2008 sale
7382780 squatters in iraqi buildings fear theyll soon be on the street
7382781 lack of services financial support make life difficult for returnees
7382782 now were the ones who have to subsidise fuel for the company
7382783 obviously with the rising consumer prices that followed the fuel price hike people who were in the near poor category have become poor
7382784 we expect it to happen two or three months after the fuel price hike but after that the level will be normal again
7382785 everything has become more expensive including cooking oil and flour
7382786 whoever the president is is the same little people like us will always suffer
7382787 that has now come down to 81 9c which is a reduction of 15 4c
7382788 to cut to the chase on tuesday the average price for that same period had fallen by 15c to an average of 144 4c
7382789 for motorists it is very confusing and if they are still seeing prices up around 162c they are upset the prices arent coming down
7382790 it is extremely difficult and that is the benefit of fuelwatch
7382791 there was a 27c per litre range in sydney yesterday some petrol retailers may not pass on the reductions in wholesale prices as quickly as others
7382792 those particular retailers are outed using the fuelwatch system at the moment they keep prices higher until someone is cheaper
7382793 we will probably see prices down below 1 30 soon and over this coming week well see the national average price down to 1 25
7382794 it is starting to work its way down theres should be another 5c to 10c of savings coming for motorists to enjoy
7382795 we have a watchdog that has bark but no bite
7382796 we hope his replacement is going to be aggressive and pursue oil companies to look after motorists interests
7382797 i filled up on saturday in parramatta and it was 1 36 compared with anything ive seen around it was cheap as chips i travel everywhere and it is much cheaper to fill up further away from the city in campbelltown and places like that it is much cheaper
7382798 over the long run fuel prices do have an effect a longer term process of adaption is set off
7382799 it is possible that the recent oil price increases have set off such a process and that if oil prices remain on an upward trajectory the adaption process may still have a long way to run
7382800 too much of a good thing is an awesome thing but too much of an awesome thing is umm really really dumb and bad
7382801 los peque os actos que se ejecutan son mejores que todos aquellos grandes que se planean
7382802 micah was a little bit groggy obviously but the paramedics did their job there are always concerns when you see incidents like this they stabilised him and got him off the pitch
7382803 they did all the correct things and by all accounts he was lucid in the tunnel
7382804 i do not think there is any concern regarding a neck injury it is more he has a bang on his head
7382805 he will be observed for the next couple of hours and he may be allowed to go home providing he has some support there
7382806 it is always nice to play well in front of the owner of the club it does help
7382807 i spoke to him earlier in the week and i was really excited by what he had to say i am sure he enjoyed the game today
7382808 this was a big win for us irrespective of west ham going down to 10 men so early i felt we were in control
7382809 there was a real determination in our play and a willingness to ask questions of the opposition
7382810 it was a good all round performance and once we got our noses in front there was only going to be one winner
7382811 i do not think any one of my players can hold their hands up and say they performed
7382812 given the personnel we have available i do not think we were equipped to play with 10 men
7382813 we needed to defend in the second half with our lives and the first goal is always important
7382814 its an area known for avalanches it the ice regularly breaks off here
7382815 they were in the trail but problem was that the avalanche swept away the trail
7382816 the guide shouted run fast run fast it didnt make any noise it really was impressive
7382817 we had just enough time to move away to the right before getting hit we were really lucky
7382818 from the moment we could locate them with radar echo and surface analyses it was already five hours after the avalanche so theres no more hope

7382820 i still have things that i want to do in the sport ive never competed over here in london and im looking forward to really experience more of the city and be able to prepare myself to hopefully swim some fast times
7382821 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7382822 the handover was marked with a quirky eight minute cameo of the capital that smacked more of the swinging sixties than of the 21st century cosmopolis that will stage the next games
7382823 if this is a statement of intent from the 2012 organisers that they will not try to match
7382824 as an emerging superpower china felt it had something to prove london should in keeping with our nations character be a little more understated
7382825 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7382826 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7382827 i dont think such a buildup will foster the stabilization of the atmosphere in the region
7382828 i wouldnt have been able to afford a normal shop
7382829 an estimated 40 000 flats still stand empty thats about 14 to 15 percent of all of leipzigs apartments
7382830 we are trying to stabilize the situation and rescue the buildings
7382831 but i like it you can do your own thing
7382832 the entire area has become more lively there are new markets new art shows and lots of small boutiques and galleries have suddenly emerged
7382833 the first step is always for artists to arrive then firms follow and finally people fill up the remaining flats
7382834 the kids in this neighborhood dont have much offered to them
7382835 thats where i come in i can teach them how to make candles

7382839 they hypocrites have made their oaths a screen for their misdeeds thus they obstruct men from the path of allah truly evil are their deeds
7382840 dont obey the type of despicable men ready with oaths defamer going about with slander habitually hindering all good transgressing beyond bounds deep in sin ignoble besides all that base born
7382841 we always clean at our friends houses why dont they clean up
7382842 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7382843 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7382844 everything that you get in this game youve earned whether it be a touchdown a win whatever it is
7382845 in some sense it is satisfying in that light but trust me theres a lot of work ahead and i know that probably just as much as everybody around here theres going to be some ups and downs but youve just got to stay mentally tough and grind through it thats where my mind set is right now
7382846 we feel like he gives us the best chance to win
7382847 hes picked up our system ill have to keep repeating this but its a learning curve for a quarterback in this league hes going to see some things he hasnt seen before but i think matt is the kind of guy who might get fooled once but the next time it comes up hes going to be able to handle it i really anticipate that we wont see the gaffes that a lot of people think
7382848 he just shook it off and said im glad i got that one out of the way in the preseason
7382849 hes got a very good outlook about the game of football hes got a good understanding to play quarterback in this league hes prepared for it hes mature beyond his years and itll be a great season for him to come in and be out leader
7382850 hes going to have his growing pains just like anybody
7382851 you look at peyton manning in his first year he struggled i just hope the fans and the media give this guy a chance hes not going to go out there and be a hall of famer every game this year hes going to have some mistakes and were going to help him out as much as possible
7382852 chinese authorities informed us last night that the eight individuals detained august 20 and 21 respectively were deported by chinese authorities
7382853 we urge china to take positive steps to address international and domestic concerns about its record on human rights and religious freedoms
7382854 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of 10 tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games
7382855 mom she fired me can you come and get me
7382856 she was having a hard time staying busy and wouldnt work on a custom order so i had to keep giving her jobs to do
7382857 finally i said she could go home if she couldnt find enough to do
7382858 this feels weird now but we made this for you to say thank you ill talk to my daughter and give you a call
7382859 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
7382860 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
7382861 the real question is longer term will carriers cede control
7382862 is not a great book to read thin characterization and an obsession with biography not story
7382863 as a process the experience was strewn with beauty vivid images and arresting phrases the author for instance described desert vegetation ready to burst into life at the first rumour of moisture the writing style has a quirky inventiveness that regularly surprises where towards asmara eventually breaks down however is its inability to take the reader past the credibility hurdle that spans observer and participant
7382864 explores how ancestral connections are narrated in both history and fiction written by irish australian authors thomas keneally and christopher koch it argues that ancestry allows people to imaginatively inhabit the historical period their ancestor lived in but more importantly to identify with their ancestor s keneally focuses on the development of national identity through ancestry while koch is more concerned with the inheritance of particular constructions of masculinity

7382873 i leave it to other people to say who is the ruler of the olympics
7382874 our rallies have attracted hundreds of thousands of people in the past nearly 15 days which were all peaceful
7382875 as the coach of olympic silver medallist lee chong wei misbun has done a fantastic job in making the nation proud

7382882 a lot of people havent read his books and want to feel connected to him
7382883 he really was an extraordinary son and brother and he is an extraordinary father and i want to encourage people to take in that human dimension i do not feel as though it is at all unrelated to the kind of president hes going to be
7382884 hopped on the backs of motorcycles with women in rural credit programs all over the world
7382885 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7382886 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7382887 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7382888 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7382889 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7382890 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7382891 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7382892 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7382893 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7382894 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7382895 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7382896 we are not willing to engage in speculation about any future announcements regarding troop numbers and deployments
7382897 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7382898 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7382899 assess the actual situation in tibet and let the world know the truth
7382900 the opinion of the security forces is that the risk resulting from their release is low
7382901 the israeli government is making a big mistake by releasing now terrorists now with blood on their hands the first time for many years
7382902 and the lesson to the region is that terror pay s off
7382903 you are now putting him in a situation that he is the same like hamas both of them want terrorists back in the yard
7382904 these 200 it takes israel one week to ten days to re arrest them
7382905 can in fact deliver much more for their own people than the extremists than the terrorists ever can
7382906 they simply told us to get out of the car and started beating us with gun butts with sticks
7382907 i got injuries in my chest my lumbar and one of my assistants got a fracture in his arm then two police personnel watching nearby came to our rescue and took us to a nearby hospital

7382909 do you really think nuns are all elderly straitlaced and funereal
7382910 its no longer that way these days there are nuns from africa and latin america who are really very very lovely the brazilians particularly
7382911 i was startled but it brought home to me what a powerful get out of jail free card mccain had earned by not getting out of jail free so its hard to believe that john mccain is now in danger of exceeding his credit limit on the equivalent of an american express black card
7382912 barack obama is in training to become panderer in chief
7382913 well is it possible for a person to do all those things and not be a christian
7382914 well people of the jewish faith take the same evidence we use as proof for our faith and use it to support theirs what do you do with that
7382915 do you think you have more of a conscience driven by what youve grown up with or a personal faith of your own
7382916 i believe in the god of the bible and it doesnt matter what anyone says about it
7382917 you dont really know a plant unless youve killed it three times
7382918 sabemos que atravessa per odo dif cil mas estamos com kimi acreditamos no seu potencial e at o fim do campeonato ele retomar ao seu melhor

7382923 if you are not scared then swear by the quran
7382924 asri denied the accusation and challenged tunku to swear in a mosque to prove that he was telling the truth
7382925 the tunku accepted the challenge and swore in the masjid zahir alor star witnessed by pas representative the late yusof rawa
7382926 for the non web savvy a widget company invokes negative images of a commodity product
7382927 at the same time it doesnt sound from an investor perspective that youre investing in something thats shallow and not indicative of the amount of time put into the technology
7382928 for now the government is concentrating more on ensuring that he mwanawasa is given a decent burial and that since the body is going to go around the provinces weve got nine provinces and its only after that will it come back to lusaka for final burial i think that is the preoccupation now
7382929 as for the ruling party mmd of course within the dynamics of internal politics there is of course jostling for people who would want to participate in this election but so far things will only begin to crystallize after the burial
7382930 well the late president has said one of the criteria for a person qualified to be a candidate he must be free from graft and we will definitely uphold that because the people of zambia will not like to see a leadership that is corrupt to take charge of the affairs so that is one of the criteria and at the end of the day im sure we will succeed to uphold that one so all those who are cheating themselves that they will have it easy because he mwanawasa has passed on will be in for a rude shock
7382931 i think the development in the economy has been so salutary that there is nobody who can fault our party and the next election we are talking about is within 90 days and it would be very difficult for our opponents to galvanize resources and support within 90 days to be able to find a candidate who can beat our candidate so what he opposition leader michael sata obtained at that time i dont think the circumstances are still the same
7382932 if you recall that the last elections were sponsored by our own budget and i think we are still determined to go that way of course this is not saying that assistance which is without strings would not be accepted but i think we would like to go our own way so that at the end of the day the outcome is a zambian brewed outcome where the resources are zambian the participants are zambians and whoever is elected at that time will accept the will of the zambian people
7382933 as mmd we would like to ensure a clean campaign and respect the rule of law and that at any time we are mindful of the fact that the late president would have even accepted a loss in an election if the outcome was going to affirm to integrity so as far as we are concerned we will do a clean campaign so that the outcome has got integrity
7382934 id like to send this letter to the prussian consulate in siam by aeromail am i too late for the 4 30 autogyro
7382935 the fact that no one voted for him was because no one heard of him
7382936 where did all his money from his campaign go into a feckin blimp
7382937 he who pays the piper gets to call the tune
7382938 the video shows a chart comparing the mainstream media coverage to the internet coverage
7382939 the odds are great the odds are difficult and i know that but i would say that what has happened so far is about 100 times greater than i anticipated and we dont know the future
7382940 george stephanopoulos has long lost credibility as a journalist as far as im concerned its not the job of a journalist to so rudely interject such personal points of view im not even a republican and i think ron paul shouldve been given the benefit of a more professional interview george has always been a fake and now hes also an unprofessional bully maybe he should run for office in the republican party
7382941 i enjoyed the opportunity to hear dr paul speak almost every word that he speaks is consistent and makes sense i may not agree with him but he clearly has principles and speaks honestly his contributions to society as a member of the military a physician a politician and a father deserve respect when jerry springer prods with sensationalist questions it is not suprising or unexpected when george stephanopoulos who claims to be a serious journalist tells dr paul he has no chance of winning and would bet every cent he has to that effect he lowers the political discourse of this nation to the paris hilton jerry springer level it is a terrible thing that given an extremely well read thoughtful politician who could speak for hours on any number of issues mr stephanopoulos uses the time to jibe and demean dr paul i acknowledge that dr paul must have the capacity to brush past this type of treatment to win the election and that no heinous wrong was committed it shows mr stephanopoulos and the producers have no great commitment to debate and free thought i will not watch this program again
7382942 i am a christian and as a member of the christian community im afraid we are losing control of the media
7382943 i dont believe all of what i read on the internet
7382944 please take a look at the variety of very slightly used clothing and helmets we have for sale gear that was acquired for the webbikeworld reviews
7382945 the current approval standards eec 22 05 state that the minimum light transmittance levels must be greater than 80 when riding at night and not lower than 50 when riding
7382946 zara is possibly the most innovative and devastating retailer in the world
7382947 in the past it was very taboo for an artist to do something other than endorse a soft drink its like you were selling out if you were to go beyond that
7382948 but now its like the door is open and its ok to venture out into other things and beyond that i have to be passionate about it in order to do it i love lingerie
7382949 so when the idea came about with bruno i said now thats something
7382950 this is just the start of our brand weve got a long way to go
7382951 for that particular project it was just about someones name on it that i just call licensing to me its always about being in control of what youre doing and making sure that you can cope with where youre going
7382952 now there are many businesses in the private sector that are looking at their staffing levels
7382953 youre better off making a decisive strike and doing it once and once only
7382954 a pretty good cross section all the disciplines i was looking for are there
7382955 to support economically viable livelihoods in multimedia performing arts and related cultural fields
7382956 the sector understands that this is a long term funding pipeline
7382957 our board of directors in conjunction with the committee representing about 78 of our bond holders has decided to complete a financial restructuring through a pre packaged bankruptcy
7382958 all of our mrs fields stores in australia are independent businesses with no plans for any closures whatsoever to the contrary we are expanding the network to 50 stores and kiosks and have opened two new stores and five new cookie counters in the past 12 months
7382959 we anticipate minimal impact from events in the us with no direct financial or operational impact as the supply chain is independently owned and operated in contrast to an australian bankruptcy in the us a pre packaged bankruptcy will take between 30 to 90 days and does not require for assets to be frozen and can be used to restructure a company financially
7382960 it would protect indigenous arts and culture but on the other side would give value to retailers manufacturers and consumers by making a really clear distinction between the bogus and those making value
7382961 anwar has made pkr become like a business entity where he is the chief executive officer
7382962 keeping books up to date preparing budgets including cash flow forecasts and comparing actual results against budgeted results are essential and puts businesses in a far better position to manage their cash flow resources and profitability
7382963 it does show the concentration of power in terms of google
7382964 because of googles dominance startups are worried about starting anything in search advertising and trying to take on google
7382965 saya bukan imam besar di situ saya cuma imam biasa sahaja

7382971 spaeth has been rock solid for us as a tight end we use quite a few two tight end sets hes the 12th starter on our offense if you will a very reliable guy an emerging second year guy

7382985 last week optus chief executive paul osullivan said telstra was holding up the nbn by not complying with its network information requirements
7382986 this confirmation demonstrates that mr osullivans claim was false and he should apologise for misleading the public
7382987 im flabbergasted that telstra is claiming optus is peddling falsehoods when you look at the history how can they have the gall to claim that the delay is our fault
7382988 the nbn taskforce has been back and forth with telstra for many months on its network information so telstra has had multiple chances to work and rework it this is a case of third or fourth time lucky for the monopolist

7383034 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period he said
7383035 by banning the intra day price movements of fuel retailers motorists will ultimately pay more at the pump particularly those thousands of motorists that already shop smart and take advantage of the weekly discount cycle
7383036 we as a government are committed to taking tough decisions and tough action for the economys long term interest and also for the environments long term interest

7383040 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts
7383041 the company aims to hold workers pay to below the rate of inflation effectively cutting its wages bill by almost 15 per cent over four years
7383042 for the average technician this would amount to a cut in real wages over time of 7300 a year
7383043 telstra is a prime example of big employers who are behaving badly towards their staff and thumbing their nose at the rudd governments cooperative industrial relations policy
7383044 we expect to see new laws introduced into the parliament very soon to scrap all of work choices and replace it with a fair and balanced industrial relations system
7383045 we have taken the extra step of talking to wholesale employees about whats important to them and that will be reflected in any proposed agreement

7383072 there still is a possibility that obama will chip into the republican advantage with this religious outreach
7383073 even if he gains just a few points that could be decisive in a close election
7383074 i didnt even know the dnc was in town i dont watch the news

7383078 the issue which is not just a bad case scenario as far as pakistan is concerned or as afghanistan is concerned but it is going to be spreading further the whole world is going to be affected by it

7383081 i know we can count on the nea the afl cio and change to win
7383082 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now

7383086 there will be more bank failures but nothing compared with previous cycles such as the savings and loans days
7383087 what is offered for sale is all deposit liabilities insured and uninsured together with the good assets of the bank usually including the bank building itself and certain performing loans in the bank
7383088 insured depositors can still sleep easily and because of that a lot of bankers can sleep easily too
7383089 indymac failure is expected to reduce the fdics designated reserve ratio for its deposit insurance fund to less than 1 15
7383090 then an industry consisting of hundreds of insolvent firms is surely the last institution about which anyone can mention insurance with a straight face
7383091 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok

7383096 i firmly believe that the kind of immersive interactive 3d environment that this type of virtual world provides has dramatic implications for those of us dedicated to generating interest in classical music at all levels including music education music appreciation and especially for the promotion of new music and living composers imagine being able to talk with a composer or author or music educator in real time from the comfort of your own computer this environment has the potential to reach out to the four corners of the planet and to make the world a better place one friendship at a time
7383097 such as hard red plastic as well as clear flexible rubber like material
7383098 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7383099 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7383100 she had 50 per cent of the democratic vote obama has 50 per cent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7383101 shes going to be an important an important voice in this campaign
7383102 but obama felt that senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7383103 theyre going to be won over by the clintons appearance this week and what they say
7383104 the day went on and i got thinking about it a little bit more
7383105 my file was in there and when it came time to stand up and speak i did
7383106 this was back on the 26th of april and there was a lot of talk being made that elderly women did not support barack obama
7383107 it was also said that catholics didnt support barack obama
7383108 i think that my age played to my advantage in a way to be able to say im new

7383110 i shoot hoops every now and then with a friend
7383111 we play video games not much time for much else
7383112 many latinos in california and new york and texas say really
7383113 that minnesota is really prepared to respond to the changing demographics of this country
7383114 and that we are prepared to send the voices that will speak on behalf of those individuals that now need to be in office that really need to have a voice in the white house
7383115 when we talk about diversity we talk about the fabric and the kaleidoscope of what minnesota really represents and that will stand in stark contrast to what you will see here a week later in this city on the other side of the aisle
7383116 in their latest effort to solve a double murder that thus far has neither motive nor suspects oklahoma police have revealed the make of one of the weapons used to kill two young girls on a country road nearly 10 weeks ago
7383117 since we dont have a motive we just cant look in one direction for a certain person
7383118 heres the only way its going to help us probably if someone just bought a gun or they loaned it to someone recently right before the homicides and got it back
7383119 we just want people to cooperate so we can find this weapon and then the person who had it in his hand
7383120 i messed up so its best for the team and im here for them

7383165 eventually when you consolidate the ftas it is possible that you could end up with something like that an asia wide fta
7383166 substantial gains could be realised from consolidating the many ftas into a single region wide one

7383190 when i was diving in 1976 we were still considered amateurs nobody got any endorsements actually that was the first year bruce jenner won the decathlon and he had two agents which was unheard of
7383191 being a little charismatic that doesnt hurt and on top of being marketable being successful and maybe winning a gold medal or superbowl because that puts them more in demand
7383192 when i was diving i did it because i loved it but now in some ways it may be a distraction to have all that going on appearances you have to make worrying about losing the contract for some reason or another
7383193 id love to meet him vijender performed well and tried his best even if its just the bronze he made india and all of us proud his triumph at the olympics will inspire many youngsters to take up boxing i wish him success

7383213 ganz wichtig ist die eigenen f higkeiten die handwerklichen f higkeiten und den zeitbedarf realistisch einzusch tzen nur die arbeiten zu machen die man tats chlich kann arbeiten gut zu planen und nat rlich auch wenn freunde und verwandte mithelfen das die gut versichert sind

7383448 the new group thats saying we should just throw the permit cap out they forget that there were those of us making the argument that theyre trying to make now
7383449 every city that has opened up the taxi market has had lower taxi prices in the long run more taxis and better taxi service for the people who use them
7383450 considering how volatile the issue was for so many years that petition is the first significant thing ive seen in a while
7383451 its a basic argument certainly we are familiar with this point of view
7383452 the industry hasnt done a great job as a whole marrying crm define with knowledge applications
7383453 were making a very strategic and aggressive acquisition in the customer service and support space which is a 3 4 billion market according to gartner
7383454 so all applications running on our platforms will be able to use it
7383455 looked at lots of different companies and instranet won the gold for their technology and their solutions
7383456 can be deployed in a matter of two to 12 weeks depending on the size of the company and the number of agents it has because its all point and click
7383457 create as large a repository as possible of real time metrics data from windows pcs all over the world whos running what and how its performing
7383458 the study monitors only a very small sample from an unknown number of sources
7383459 these users are not necessarily representative of windows vista users as a whole
7383460 per our longstanding practice allowing downgrade rights enterprise customers and purchasers of windows vista ultimate or windows vista business editions can choose to downgrade to windows xp professional if they feel they need more time to get ready for windows vista
7383461 may downgrade in the short term but with an eye toward upgrading later
7383462 we found that 65 percent of the boxes pre loaded with vista were still running it and the rest were running windows xp
7383463 either manually wiped the drive and installed xp or paid the vendor to uninstall vista and install xp it blows you away that people will pay not to have the default operating system
7383464 getting metrics about your pc is not the kind of thing grandma would want to do
7383465 contrary to the recent devil mountain software survey windows vista momentum is getting stronger and stronger
7383466 i hope joe gives the ibb when manny comes to the plate against moose i cant bear to see another one leave the yard
7383467 really im more scared of our bats defense if they decide not to show up this wont be pretty
7383468 why dont you get up with me tomrorow morning at 5 30 and well spend some time talking over breakfast
7383469 what we expected to find is that the migration to ipv6 is slow
7383470 i dont think youd find anyone that expected there to be a significant ramp up in ipv6 usage what was surprising in what we found is that there is no migration
7383471 we saw a flat proportion of ipv4 to ipv6 over the course of the year
7383472 so although in aggregate ipv6 did grow its growing at about the same level that general internet traffic is growing
7383473 we have some monitoring in asia but we would like to see more there obviously iekel johnson admitted
7383474 its not quite as comprehensive as the european and north american measurements
7383475 in general we agree with the findings of the report issued today
7383476 it seems comprehensive and we appreciate the value of these types of studies as they help raise awareness and understanding of critical industry issues
7383477 we see press releases from lots of providers across the world talking about ipv6 readiness or infrastructure deployed and im sure its all true it just doesnt seem like anyone is using it
7383478 its a slow moving train and there is no perception that there is an immediate problem so there is nothing motivating the switch
7383479 theres a massive wave of phosphorylation in dividing cells much bigger than anyone expected
7383480 this discovery implies that weve severely underestimated the scope of regulation in cell division for decades which has implications for our understanding of a wide range of diseases and developmental defects linked to the cell cycle from cancer to holes in the heart
7383481 an enormous number of proteins more than 1 000 became highly phosphorylated during cell division some more than 10 times
7383482 maybe the cell does something akin to putting humpty dumpty back together again at the end
7383483 the massive number of phosphorylation changes in cell division strongly suggests that it involves a massive reorganization of the cell
7383484 or the cell might phosphorylate everything to ensure that it hits a few key targets critical for proper division
7383485 this study demonstrates how much a broad systematic approach to protein modification can facilitate experiments in the cell cycle field
7383486 we will be reaping results from this study for years ahead
7383487 tuhan tolong sadarkan anak yang kusayangi ini supaya tidak berbuat dosa lagi aku sudah tua dan ingin menyaksikan dia bertobat sebelum aku mati

7383491 green lean and sustainable the new era of automotive recycling
7383492 the launch of this training tool is another major achievement for urg
7383493 it fills a crucial need and we expect it to be used extensively by recyclers as well as others in the collision and repair and insurance industries the automotive recycling industry is changing dramatically and its important for everyone to understand who we are today automotive recycling is green it is sustainable and it is very cost effective our quality is top notch and the use of our original equipment recycled parts means the insurance industry body shops and the end customer all need to know that they are getting best in class when they buy recycled this presentation does that and more
7383494 this training tool is a great first step in bringing the recycling industry together to continue to develop the best practices and standards our industry can use to drive awareness in the collision and mechanical repair markets i predict it is going to be used widely
7383495 green lean and sustainable the new era of automotive recycling
7383496 what we are really trying to do with this presentation is get everyone up to date
7383497 most people still conjure up an image of the old fashioned junkyard when they hear about automotive recycling its important to change that misperception and understand that our industry is green lean and sustainable the urg advisory group has worked hard to produce an outstanding training tool and we invite anyone interested to contact us for a copy
7383498 its safe to say its gone beyond my wildest expectations and my expectations were really high
7383499 the results from this survey clearly show that these games were truly a cultural event
7383500 i knew the bride when she used to rock amp roll
7383501 people ask me why did you decide to run for president
7383502 ive decided that the real reason is secret service protection for my two girls as they enter into their teenage years
7383503 so whenever a young man comes by for a date were going to have one of these guys see these mean looking guys with the glasses who dont crack a smile
7383504 i took it off the table a long time ago you cant talk about impeachment unless you have the facts and you cant have the facts unless you have cooperation from the administration i think the republicans would like nothing better than for us to focus on impeachment and take our eye off the ball of a progressive economic agenda

7383512 i think hes takanori gomi very strong and i respect him very much i think its important that he can excite the audience
7383513 i knew that he was a good striker i took his punches well
7383514 i think the japanese fighters had the audience backing them up so they had to win
7383515 all i can do is try my best im hoping that they put me up against a good fighter in the next round
7383516 i have two more fights that i have to do my best at
7383517 i hope the japanese fighters continue to do well in this tournament
7383518 john mccain has held more positions than mitt romneys son in a gay bath house
7383519 dear he is no such thing that is what we on the right have wanted you to think but between you me and the mimosa hes more pro life than commander guy he not only wants to appoint more conservative judges and justices he wants to go further and make birth control illegal
7383520 and if you think that john mccain is going to do anything to promote your agendas you are crazier than you look
7383521 he is so anti gay that he wants to make being gay illegal
7383522 he is so much for states rights that all of us neo cons are hoping he will permit mississippi to repeal the thirteenth amendment
7383523 if they do i will move to gulf port so my family can get back some of the property stolen from us thanks to mr lincoln i have my eye on that wesley snipes you know i dont just need field hands after seeing that movie mandingo i need myself some big black buck to warm my lonely nights
7383524 john mccain is hated by the right because he has said nasty things about bush
7383525 he may have been vocal about commander guy and he might have declared the last four years a mess but no ones lips have been more firmly planted on the deciders ass than john mccains
7383526 but please dont let reality get in the way of your voting for john mccain after all the only thing worse than an incompetent republican idiot running the country is an articulate savvy intelligent democrat

7383530 krump hop is a great cardio workout and can appeal to a lot more people at one time
7383531 a mixture of the two makes it an enjoyable workout option it even appeals to dance lovers and professionals
7383532 the good news is that we did almost the same mileage as last year with 63 people instead of 178
7383533 we are doing this for the young people to get them into a healthy lifestyle at an early age
7383534 he started early and didnt stop until he had completed his goal
7383535 there are more and more people who want to do this active lifestyle for themselves and for the community

7383548 i think arguing issues at a government level is a waste of time
7383549 theres a lot of bitterness which is completely understandable we need to build a bridge through education
7383550 it needs to start with kids aboriginal kids need to feel their culture exists outside their community
7383551 internationally people are really interested really fascinated by indigenous australian culture but theres not a lot of information available to them
7383552 places in north western australia around the kimberleys give an insight into the history of human beings not just a culture people definitely respect that and are intrigued by it
7383553 merely a club but as a venue that hosts events
7383554 we dont yet know a reason for the decline but we suspect it is due not to the wisdom of crowds but to the increased level of conflict among community members

7383561 a parte questo rimangono naturalmente molte altre cose da dire per esempio in che modo affronto lo studio di una nuova partitura o anche di una partitura non nuova perch nel vero senso della parola ogni partitura nuova tutte le volte che ci si accinge a studiarla cos quando presi a rileggere la nona sinfonia di beethoven per la cinquantesima volta dissi a me stesso che le avrei dedicato al massimo unora dopo cena giusto il tempo di dare unocchiata e di rinfrescarmi la memoria prima di andare a letto ahim dopo mezzora ero ancora a pagina due ed ero ancora alle prese col sacro testo alle due del mattino e badi bene rivolto allintervistatrice n d r non certo vicino al finale ero ancora fermo alladagio rapito in mezzo alle stelle perch vi stavo trovando uninfinit di cose nuove era come se non lavessi mai vista prima naturalmente ricordavo tutte le note come pure tutte le idee la struttura perfino il suo mistero ma c sempre qualcosa di nuovo da scoprire e non appena trovi una cosa nuova ecco che le altre ti appaiono come sotto una luce diversa perch la novit altera la relazione con tutto il resto impossibile immaginare quante cose nuove ci sono da scoprire specialmente in beethoven che fu particolarmente vicino a dio e uno dei compositori dalla personalit pi ricca che siano mai esistiti
7383562 dopo le esecuzioni che io chiamo buone unesperienza incredibile come se componessi in quel momento devono passare alcuni minuti prima che riesca a ricordare dove mi trovo in quale sala o teatro in quale paese o chi sono una sorta di estasi che corrisponde in tutto e per tutto alla perdita di coscienza

7383564 again it will be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his property to them
7383565 after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them the man who had received the five talents brought the other five master he said you entrusted me with five talents see i have gained five more
7383566 his master replied well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful with a few things i will put you in charge of many things come and share your masters happiness
7383567 the man with the two talents also came master he said you entrusted me with two talents see i have gained two more
7383568 his master replied well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful with a few things i will put you in charge of many things come and share your masters happiness
7383569 then the man who had received the one talent came master he said i knew that you are a hard man harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed so i was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground see here is what belongs to you
7383570 his master replied you wicked lazy servant so you knew that i harvest where i have not sown and gather where i have not scattered seed well then you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers so that when i returned i would have received it back with interest
7383571 take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents for everyone who has will be given more and he will have an abundance whoever does not have even what he has will be taken from him and throw that worthless servant outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth

7383573 the government responds with no evidence beyond an assertion that the appellants claims are without supporting proof and are unverified and speculative
7383574 the appellants declaration is itself some evidence on the appellants claim
7383575 identified particular government offices he contacted about his case during a particular timeframe
7383576 offers adequate detail to give the government a fair opportunity to rebut the appellants contention that he asserted his right to speedy post trial review the government undeniably in the best position to verify or refute the appellants claims has provided no evidence to the contrary
7383577 three to four years after his trial he was denied employment as a fork lift operator by the costco store in huntsville alabama
7383578 identical job in a costco store in california and that the reason he could not transfer his employment from california to alabama was specifically because he lacked his final discharge papers dd form 214
7383579 under allende an appellants declaration or affidavit of prejudice standing alone will never be sufficient to meet his burden of proof no matter how detailed and specific it might be
7383580 to be adequately specific a post trial claim for relief must state specific facts which if true entitle the appellant to the relief sought as well a ppellant must specifically identify how he would be prejudiced due to the delay finally a claim must be detailed enough to provide the government a fair opportunity to rebut the contention asserted
7383581 burden is on the appellant to provide legally competent evidence demonstrating the prejudice asserted
7383582 while an appellants affidavit or declaration based on first hand knowledge of the facts standing alone is legally competent evidence in allende our superior court was unpersuaded by the appellants affidavit in the absence of additional supporting legally competent evidence
7383583 appellants declaration states a claim of legal error and provides adequate detail to permit the government to validate or dispute his claims
7383584 the only remaining question therefore is whether in light of allende the appellant has adequately substantiated his claim of prejudice
7383585 while the appellant provided an adequately detailed declaration articulating prejudice to his employment opportunities he has not met his additional burden to provide corroborating evidence or an explanation of why such evidence could not be obtained consequently this fourth factor of prejudice weighs in favor of the government
7383586 the delay is so egregious that tolerating it would adversely affect the publics perception of the fairness and integrity of the military justice system
7383587 h aving found constitutional error we must now determine if the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt to determine if relief is required
7383588 to independently corroborate his assertion of specific employment prejudice or alternatively to provide facts explaining his inability to provide such independent corroboration the government has met its burden to show that the post trial error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt
7383589 assume s assume error and proceed s directly to the question of whether any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt
7383590 appellant asserts prejudice on the grounds that his ability to obtain employment has been impaired because he has not been able to show employers a department of defense form 214 dd 214 the certificate of release from active duty
7383591 often recognized interference with post military employment opportunities as a form of prejudice that warrants relief for unreasonable post trial delay
7383592 appellants affidavit asserts that four employers declined to consider him for employment in the period of august october 2000 approximately a year after his trial was completed and that two employers declined to consider him for employment for that reason in 2007 appellant has not provided documentation from potential employers regarding their employment practices nor has he otherwise demonstrated a valid reason for failing to do so
7383593 in that context we conclude that the assumed error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and note that appellant has failed to present any substantiated evidence to the contrary
7383594 i am not sure who can step up to the plate and demand an investigation behind sen schumers motives but it needs to be done
7383595 likely to be too optimistic and even the 0 9 million b d assumed by the iea and opec may prove too ambitious if recent history is a guide
7383596 i dont think thats a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer then we have something to talk about
7383597 quentin is the mvp in my mind for the start that hes had and the way hes maintained it he does everything he plays in the outfield he has a strong arm hes a great base runner goes first to third with the best of them and he is a middle infielders nightmare on double plays
7383598 you give good teams extra outs and they are going to bludgeon you and thats whats happening in the early innings today
7383599 make no mistake this rays team is a good team they will take advantage of every opportunity you give them
7383600 thats the thing that im the most proud of and these guys should be proud of also the fact that they go out there and they take the ball every time and give us a chance to win a ballgame again
7383601 we have to get on base every time we get on base we have a chance because everyone in the lineup is capable of hitting a homerun
7383602 i remember when guillen came in the game and hes still the same person as when he first came into the game he was outgoing very talkative loved to talk baseball as a rookie and he continues that same personality this is what you get everyone in chicago hell tell you what he thinks of his ballclub what he thinks of management and what he thinks of the gm thats just the way he is
7383603 when you get your players believing in what youre trying to accomplish they will have lead off bunts to start innings they will have opposite field ground ball outs to move runners they will do the little things without you leading them i told joe maddon that you cant take a players hands and lead him through a pennant race and he had turned the clubhouse over to troy percival and cliff floyd and some of the more veteran players
7383604 joe maddons club you look at their stats and you look at their offensive numbers and you say how are they doing it theyre doing it because they are pitching well and playing good defense and they get clutch hits like weve seen from carols pena how about carlos pena using a bunt to lead off the sixth inning and coming up with a big two out opposite field double to put the rays ahead in the seventh inning thats hitting with your head and taking advantage of what the team gives you
7383605 we mentioned the current management team here with andrew friedman the gm matt silverman the president and stuart sternberg the principal owner and certainly they are reaping the benefits of some foundation laid by chuck lamar and his group ahead of them its not unlike what happened with the tampa bay bucs and tony dungy who built that team up to become a pretty competitive team and then jon gruden comes in and the timing was perfect to win a super bowl in 2002 after that gruden decided to get rid of some of the key parts and they havent been the same since
7383606 if you wanted to get a postseason preview this is a pretty good one both of these teams not wanting to give up a thing
7383607 here is the spot where you really do wish you have replay so the umpires could see unbelievably acting job that a j pierzynski just turned in i mean you talk about academy award winning polish up the statue and mail it to 35th and shields because a j pierzynski just stole 90 feet on the base pads and may end up stealing a win in this 10th inning

7383611 the governor will play some kind of unspecified role in the convention
7383612 but the only contact with the mccain campaign has been a request for her to participate in a national conference call on energy issues there has been no outreach or vetting regarding the vice presidency
7383613 her rise is a great and rare story of how adherence to principle especially to transparency and accountability in government can produce political success

7383637 e estamos aprendendo coisas que para os nossos colegas parecem de outro mundo
7383638 quando meus pais falaram que iam se separar fiquei triste e confusa mas agora estou feliz d para conviver com os dois escuto mais o que meu pai diz do que antes
7383639 e fazemos programas diferentes com meu pai vamos mais a exposi es parques e com minha m e a almo os de fam lia e ao cinema
7383640 contribuo com meu modo de ver a vida que pode ser diferente do da m e deles
7383641 por enquanto talvez seja confuso para eles mas com a maturidade ser enriquecedor ter as duas vis es
7383642 a m e deles muito dedicada e amorosa as inten es dela s o boas apesar de as solu es serem diferentes das minhas
7383643 com a entrada da mulher no mercado de trabalho o homem passou a ocupar um novo lugar como pai ficou mais ativo
7383644 a crian a tem uma capacidade incr vel de adapta o pode conviver com as diferen as sem se sentir dividida ou em conflitos
7383645 n o queria virar um visitante de final de semana como um tio exclu do da rotina
7383646 este ano est sendo incr vel porque acompanhei a alfabetiza o dela isso n o se repete
7383647 era um espet culo longo e poderia ter sido atordoante se n o conhecesse a hist ria mas ela adorou
7383648 sentamos com toda a diplomacia e conversamos sobre tudo que envolve o cotidiano dela escola aula de ingl s cursos etc
7383649 n o h motivos para n o acompanhar o cotidiano do filho mesmo que haja briga com a m e pois na maioria dos casos as separa es n o s o pac ficas
7383650 hoje h 10 milh es de filhos de pais separados em lit gio
7383651 justo que esses pais fiquem sem conviver com os filhos por causa disso a guarda compartilhada poss vel em toda situa o mesmo que os pais morem em cidades diferentes
7383652 a justi a sempre fica do lado da m e se ela decide que o pai n o vai ver a crian a n o v mesmo e n o acontece nada
7383653 era pai e m e mas fui privado desse conv vio era como ter uma ferida em carne viva chor vamos juntos
7383654 por enquanto fico por dentro do seu cotidiano pelo msn e telefone a guarda compartilhada poss vel at quando se mora em continentes diferentes por causa da tecnologia
7383655 hoje ela est tima tem boas notas na escola soci vel seus olhinhos voltaram a brilhar
7383656 foi minha filha que ponderou que eu deveria ser amigo da m e dela hoje sorrimos e at nos abra amos
7383657 n o precisou de muito tempo para sentir que isso estava errado acontece um distanciamento quando voc se separa n o est se separando dos filhos
7383658 em alguns pa ses esse sistema o padr o melhor pois os pais dividem as responsabilidades e possibilita que a m e possa desenvolver sua carreira ter outros relacionamentos
7383659 numa separa o devemos fazer de tudo para que o impacto seja o menor poss vel para as crian as
7383660 enriquecedor ver que voc est contribuindo para formar novos cidad os e aprendendo com eles tamb m
7383661 if your just tuning in im here with bob clements our special guest and your listening to 101 4 with justin texture and bob and i came to the championship game at starplex field here in murfreesboro tn and we have the cardinals vs orioles today in the bottom of the first with the score tied at one with two out you can see not much has happened but oh alot is ahead with five innings to go alot could happen right now we have josh skipworth up to bat he is number 7 and has been playing here at starplex ever since he was five years old and with that much practice anyone should be very good and with josh its no exception he is one of the best batters the cardinals have on their team the pitcher is getting ready he throws it and whew josh nails it that one is way out there in the outfield josh runs for first makes it runs for second as the orioles get the ball and throws it to second josh sees the ball as he speeds up a little the second baseman cathces the ball but drops it seeing this josh starts running for third after touching second the second baseman got the ball and is about to throw it to third im guesing josh saw because hes speeding up he jumps and hes safe a great play by josh skipworth now ill let bob host for a while
7383662 well thanks justin i can see right now drew kincaid is coming up to the plate drew is number 10 and has only been at starplex for two years but is still almost as good as josh the pitcher gets ready but wait there seems to be a change the orioles coach is swapping pitchers okay the new pitcher is on the mound and gets ready to throw it drew swings but oooo misses one strike two outs will this end the first inning the pitcher gets ready again throws it drew swings but misses again one more strike and thats it for the first inning the pitcher throws drew swings but oh no he missed it well thats it for the first inning
7383663 eso no va a ocurrir porque este gobierno hace las cosas responsablemente
7383664 se 0 2 0 3 por ciento es el impacto inmediato para cuando entre en vigencia
7383665 apuntan a que las empresas bajen sus costos y moderen el incremento en precios o los bajen
7383666 estos problemas hay que abordarlos no en la pelea chica
7383667 los jugadores sacaron adelante una situaci n muy dif cil cometimos muchos errores que hicieron crecer a antofagasta que en un momento nos ten a ganado el partido se super un momento muy adverso y cr tico que es un golpe an mico muy importante de cara al partido por la copa sudamericana ante olimpia
7383668 contento por haber ganado ten amos el partido controlado cuando nos vimos perdiendo pero tuvimos la capacidad para dar vuelta el encuentro creo que a pesar de todo hicimos un buen partido es importante en lo an mico
7383669 el partido estaba cuesta arriba jugar con un hombre menos es complicado sobretodo con los equipos grandes pero con 10 hombres lo dimos vuelta aunque no pudimos mantener el marcador quede conforme con la entrega y el amor propio que est teniendo el equipo a lo mejor no lo hacemos muy bien t cnicamente pero hoy hicimos un buen partido
7383670 nunca tive a inten o de engravidar vivia focada no meu trabalho e achei que seria assim para sempre depois que conheci o meu marido percebi que queria ter filhos mas j era tarde demais
7383671 ele falou que s deus poderia fazer isso por mim
7383672 ter g meos como se fosse um acidente de percurso cerca de 10 a 15 das pacientes ocasionalmente t m dois ou tr s filhos na mesma gesta o
7383673 a t cnica prefere que seja uma crian a por vez pois mais seguro para a gestante
7383674 lembro que tive vontade de engravidar quando os filhos da f tima bernardes apresentadora do jornal nacional da rede globo nasceram eu queria g meos trig meos fiz insemina o e s consegui gerar uma crian a no fim foi bom cuidar de crian a exige muito tempo
7383675 ap s tr s tentativas a chance de gravidez para uma mulher de 35 anos pode aumentar at 50

7383679 n o existe uma tradu o definida para esse nome que derivado da palavra bully e significa brig o tirano valent o pode tamb m significar agress o f sica verbal ou psicol gica que um indiv duo exerce sobre o outro
7383680 hoje se fala tanto em bullying porque criam nomes para problemas antigos
7383681 esse problema existe nas escolas e nas empresas com as crian as e adolescentes ocorre porque h m e que n o sabe ser m e e pai que n o sabe ser pai a escola vai receber uma crian a que n o sabe ser aluno ele ter uma crise de valores e muitas vezes a escola prega uma coisa e faz outra estamos vivendo uma perda de valores a escola e a fam lia precisam buscar seus pap is e edific los
7383682 o mesmo acontece com os adultos no caso da crian a ela passa a ficar mais retra da em casa interage menos com os familiares e a v lvula de escape pode ser o computador ou a comida
7383683 o exemplo sempre vem de casa se os pais s o muito cr ticos t m intoler ncia racial de cren as valores ou moral educamos mais por exemplos do que com palavras
7383684 ao levar ou buscar os adolescentes para uma baladinha por exemplo o pai vai notar que eles est o t o empolgados que fazem coment rios a poss vel perceber se eles est o fazendo algu m de v tima ou sendo v timas de algu m
7383685 basta notar se o filho n o recebe liga es dos amigos dificilmente convidado para um anivers rio e ningu m empresta o caderno quando ele n o vai aula
7383686 n o de forma invasiva comentando o que os amigos escreveram mas averiguando se eles n o participam de nenhuma comunidade
7383687 por isso importante valorizar o almo o o jantar e todas as ocasi es em que a fam lia est reunida

7383702 selber hand anlegen kann man zum beispiel bei dekorativen arbeiten sp ter in der innenausstattung beispielsweise wenn es um das tapezieren geht
7383703 wichtig ist ja dass man hinterher in sein haus auch gesund einziehen kann ich denke ein muss sind sicherheitsschuhe festes schuhwerk mit stahlkappen und dann je nachdem was f r arbeiten man ausf hrt geh rschutz augenschutz oder ein helm und schutzhandschuhe

7383713 amalgam ist besser als sein ruf die aktuelle studie zeigt auf dass der f llstoff nicht sch dlicher ist als andere materialien es gibt und das muss man auch ganz klar sagen patienten die auf amalgam allergisch reagieren die amalgam nicht vertragen gleiches gilt aber auch f r f llungen aus gold oder aus kunststoff

7383913 surge of us troops to iraq that mr bush ordered in early 2007
7383914 real central front in the war on terrorism is not iraq
7383915 if we should have had a surge anywhere it is afghanistan senator biden said in a recent opinion article in the new york times because
7383916 the recent pakistani elections gave the moderate majority its voice back senator biden wrote
7383917 to demonstrate to its people that we care about their needs not just our own we must triple assistance for schools roads and clinics sustain it for a decade and demand accountability for the military aid we provide
7383918 i believe the united states should agree to directly engage iran first in the context of the p 5 plus 1 and ultimately country to country just as we did with north korea senator biden said in an early july press statement
7383919 the net effect of demanding preconditions that iran rejects is this we get no results and iran gets closer to the bomb he said

7383965 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
7383966 although we have seen improved functioning in some markets the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided
7383967 its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7383968 the commentary tells me that rates are on hold until they see some blue skies through this financial storm
7383969 inflation is not out of control but its clearly drifting away
7383970 with financial conditions already quite fragile the sudden unanticipated failure of bear stearns would have led to a sharp unwinding of positions in those markets that could have severely shaken the confidence of market participants
7383971 the broader economy could hardly have remained immune from such severe financial disruptions
7383972 excessively conservative lending policies could prove counterproductive if they contribute to a weaker economic and credit environment

7383986 i kind of went a little too slow anticipating anything i just wanted to make sure i caught the ball first of all and just got it in
7383987 they catch us on a play that shouldnt have been a first to thrid play that pretty much turned the game around
7383988 four guys go and say its not a home run what argument do you have to tell you the truth everybody in our dugout probably thought it was a foul ball too
7383989 it was pretty unanimous right from the beginning nobody likes to reverse one and ive been involved with some in pretty big situations like that but when you get the call right everyones behind you the media and the teams on the field

7383991 jesses got the gas yes he said gas and thats what we wanted we wanted hard inside on vlady and thats what jesse had hard inside
7383992 it was actually a good pitch but it wasnt the pitch we were trying for
7383993 supposed to try and go in i left it to any other hitter its probably a good pitch but he can reach that part of the plate and hit it pretty good

7384254 may comedy pa rin pero more on love na ididirek ni joey reyes
7384255 ang ganda ko naman masyado di ba kotse na ang nireregalo sa lola nyo
7384256 its true na may tinitingnan kaming kotse ni pol pero kung para kanino ay hindi ko na sasabihin who knows na baka para pala sa akin o para kay pol kailangan lang namin ng opinion ng bawat isa kung tama ba yung kotse o hindi yun lang naman yon
7384257 wala namang masama doon di ba it means that we trust each others taste sa mga bagay its part of the friendship na nabuo na namin with one another kaya huwag ninyong lagyan ng malisya
7384258 siguro naman kahit friends kayo you can do that not unless medyo personal na siyempre ikaw na ang magdesisyon pero when it comes naman to some things ay kailangan din natin ng opinion ng kaibigan
7384259 yung ibang tao kasi nilalagyan lang ng malisya para sa akin opinion nila yon kaya okey lang basta kami ni polo wala kaming itinatago or gustong hindi ipaalam sa mga tao were very good friends at yun lang yon
7384260 matagal ko nang gustong gawin ito pero mas maganda kung may kasabay na okasyon which is my birthday
7384261 for the past three years ang ganda ng takbo ng career ko sa tv especially when i did soap dramas with gma 7 starting with
7384262 im also thankful dahil sa pagtanggap ng marami sa anak kong si jennica garcia ever since na nag showbiz siya nag enjoy na talaga siya and shes doing very well nagsimula siya sa
7384263 so marami akong gustong pasalamatan sa panginoon for being so good to me and my family kaya theres a reason to celebrate aside from my birthday
7384264 e bakit marami raw bakit hindi tayo magtanong nagtatanong lang naman alang alang sa fans nyo sige anu ano chill ibig sabihin relax ka lang huwag kang masyadong nai stress
7384265 actually nung nalaman ko e natatawa ako dahil talagang never in my wildest dreams ko naisip na mapapasama ako dito na appreciate ko siya and much more that napabilang ako sa beinte singkong taong yon so isang karangalan sa akin yon
7384266 im very thankful talaga kumbaga minamahal ko talaga ang ginagawa ko so thats why siguro it loves me back
7384267 gusto namin talaga pagandahin nang husto lahat ng mga numbers na hindi naman namin usually ginagawa e ibubusisi namin sa darating na araw very excited na kami
7384268 bihira naman kami mag perfom sa ganoon klaseng paraan stage
7384269 since nakakita kami na umaarte sa tv so this time parang sop na pinahaba mini concert ang dating
7384270 pero maganda naman mayroon siyang numbers na never pa niyang ginawa before ako naman halos nagawa ko na dati e makakasayaw ako ulit
7384271 pero napag usapan talaga namin ni marian by hook or by crook we will watch their movie and hopefully kasama din namin si direk joyce bernal
7384272 noon ay singer pa ako this year kasi sinimulan ko yung career sa movies actually lima yung sabay sabay na ginagawa namin ngayon pero yung pinaka starring ako yung sa fidel
7384273 ako si fidel dito isa siyang overseas contract worker na may nagawang krimen sa country na nagtatrabaho siya sa middle east tapos ay nalagay siya sa death row so its based on a true to life incident talaga na ginawa lang mas cinematic para siyang lalaking version ni flor contemplacion na ang setting ay sa isang arab country
7384274 theres one scene na kailangang gawin para mas maipakita yung story
7384275 may partial nudity sa akin wala lang contact sa rapist ko
7384276 so yeah masisilip yung butt ko rito nakadapa ako after the rape scene e
7384277 tsaka yun yung mindset na nakuha ko sa pamilya ko dahil mga artista rin ang pamilya ko na talagang you forget who you are na hindi ako si lance ako si fidel and ito ang nangyari sa kanya kaya kailangan naming ipakita iyon
7384278 ang pinaka background ko sa acting is noong ginawa ko yong stage play na romeo amp juliet where i played romeo 2002 ito tapos nang ni revive ito noong 2007 kinuha nila ulit ako so parang ito ang pinaka workshop ko yon lang pero kasi hindi ba ang mommy ko ay artista so i think all my life na im living with them parang workshop na rin siguro yon
7384279 kasi yung tanda ni kuya sa akin is like ten years e so sobrang iniidolo ko siya
7384280 i think ito talaga ang calling ko kasi ang pinaka una kong break was not even here in the philippines after nang nag close yung
7384281 so after the tapings in singapore when i got back here napasok naman ako sa daisy siete after that nai offer na nga sa akin itong lead role sa fidel and yung other four movies kaya tuluy tuloy na

7384296 i just feel like if brad is available ill use him but if hes not well see what the options are i dont feel like were in the business to give guys chances to do things were still trying to win as many games as we can
7384297 im gonna go find curt right now and go over hitters
7384298 theres no plan but we dont want to overwork them in september either said bochy adding he wasnt motivated to keep lincecum on a regular turn to help his cy young award chances

7384319 ang dami naming memorable moments and yung buong experience ng paggawa ng pelikula kasama si kc ay talagang enjoy and unforgettable masaya talaga
7384320 ako first movie ko ito talaga sa buhay ko so lahat bago maganda na magkaibigan na kami ni richard bago kami nag umpisa kaya mas naging comfortable din ako ang sarap ng feeling kahit pagod masarap na pagod yung star cinema po sobrang mabait and inaalagaan kami talaga
7384321 actually ang character ko nakatira siya sa greece and si pia kcs character magbabakasyon doon ngayon at doon kami nag meet
7384322 meron po akong yaya ang yaya played by candy pangilinan ko may ka love team sa greece nakakatawa lang po siya talaga yung pagpunta namin sa greece part of the reason why nagpunta ako dahil ang pen pal niya taga greece so pumunta kami doon para magtagpo yung dalawa din so maraming rason
7384323 at ang isa din reason ay napakaganda ng greece visually talagang maganda siya makikita ninyo kung gaano siya kaganda
7384324 yung buong trip namin maganda may eksena nga kaming ginawa na drama gusto ko muna sabihin bago ang lahat e si kc isang napakahusay na aktres for her first movie napakagaling niya may eksena kaming ginawa na nag cut na si direk joyce bernal si kc tuloy pa rin ang iyak nagha hyperventilate na siya binigyan na namin siya ng tubig e hindi siya makawala doon sa eksena sa drama binuksan talaga ni direk joyce ang puso namin dito e
7384325 relaxed na alam na alam niya ang ginagagawa niya kung meron man siyang sabihin sa iyo na hindi mo usually na magugustuhan or something parang at the end of the day nagamit mo sa eksena bilang tao talaga sobra siyang okay
7384326 dahil pag work na focused gusto niya na ilabas mo ang totoo at yun ang gusto ko kay direk joyce natulungan niya kami na ilabas ang totoo
7384327 kung ano ang maganda kung ano ang hindi masyadong maganda masaya malungkot talagang ginagawa kang tao talaga ako sobra akong guarded noong umpisa kasi nga lumaki ako sa mata ng lahat parang tinitignan ako ng lahat parang yung ano na lang meron akot gusto itago sa sarili ko so medyo nahirapan ako noong first few days and then ngayon with my experience ko with direk joyce e wala na akong pakialam kahit anong ipagawa sa akin okay lang
7384328 sa lahat naman ng bagay naging supportive ang buong family ko they are always there for me sila din ang sandalan ko ano man ang mangyari
7384329 yung experience din po ng mga magulang namin e siyempre binahagi din nila sa amin kung ano ang natutunan din nila simula noong kasing edad namin sila so naiintindihan nila ang pinagdadaanan namin
7384330 iba naman po ang generation namin at iba yung naging experience namin sa naging experience nila
7384331 iba naman po ang mabibigay namin din sa mga tao na sana magustuhan nila siyempre may namana din kami from our parents pero siyempre may kaunting mabibigay din kami na bago para sa kanila
7384332 we just give our best we did our best for this project
7384333 well ako i did my part since si kc first movie niya ito pareho naman kami actually pareho kaming may pressure siyempre ang laki ng pressure na galingan namin we have to do our best we have to give our all so nandoon kami para sa isat isa kaya i want to thank kc na naging supportive talaga siya sa akin at ginawa niya parang napaka comfortable ang set at inalagaan niya kami hindi lang ako kami
7384334 lahat po ng maririnig ninyong magaganda about him ay totoo bilang tao professionally totoo talaga
7384335 siyempre pagdating sa trabaho ang support namin sa isat isa bilang dalawang actors bilang magkatrabaho isang kapuso at isang kapamilya
7384336 masasabi ko na throughout the whole experience na nagpunta kami sa greece nag travel kami together binuksan ang mga puso namin sa harap and likod ng camera at talagang naging malalim ang samahan namin ni kc para sa akin unforgettable experience yon

7384341 hes had so many things like this happen to him
7384342 hes had a lot of tough breaks injury wise he was on a one year contract so this was very tough for him
7384343 so it would be tough to only go with two guys who have played before

7384366 theres less than 1 percent of the population in iowa that is african american
7384367 there is probably less than 4 or 5 percent that are minorities what is in washington
7384368 the biden campaign quickly issued a statement asserting that the candidate was referring to socioeconomic status not racial differences the lesson we took was not to think that mr biden is a racist we dont but to worry about his tendency to speak too much before he thinks enough

7384370 but we acknowledge at the same time that the situation was a major change in comparison to before the games

7384372 lets not forget one thing it is not the ioc running the internet it is the chinese government running the internet
7384373 the regulations might not be perfect but they are a sea change compared to the situation before we hope that they will continue
7384374 chinese authorities agreed to establish these protest zones the same way it had been done in sydney in 2000 salt lake city in 2002 and athens in 2004

7384382 while voluntary the guide represents good practice in handling breaches and i would urge all organisations to consider using it
7384383 its good for a holiday but not if you are serious about your career
7384384 im a little bit skinnier than when we finished biggest loser
7384385 ive also helped four people lose about 50kg between them in the past three months
7384386 hes had so many things like this happen to him i believe this might be his fourth acl maybe in his career hes had a lot of tough breaks injury wise so he was on a one year contract so this was very tough for him
7384387 theres not a lot of history there as far as guys playing in the league besides javon and ronald
7384388 really none of those guys have really played before so it would be tough to only go with two guys who have played before
7384389 ive been in this position before when i was in denver and jay cutler was in his first year starting and i was the only receiver and came along
7384390 so its nothing new for me i just know what i do and i know what i can go out and bring so im just going to do that execute and make plays

7384403 its 9 30 in the morning so its a day wedding and then the reception is an afternoon reception so its more casual than anything its not a coat and tie
7384404 nakakalungkot but the reason i had it here not only is my family here but most of his family is based here he doesnt have family in the philippines so if i had it in the philippines it would have been only be good for me siyempre naman were trying to be fair to each other
7384405 may mga nagtataka kung bakit sudden ang wedding baka daw infaticipating ka
7384406 i kept it very quiet i just wanted everything to have fallen in place as possible i wanted to be it on my own
7384407 how old were you when you migrated to the u s
7384408 we left the philippines when i was about two three years old
7384409 what were the first things that attracted you to her
7384410 the things i liked about her all these years were that shes down to earth
7384411 after two weeks im going to fly back to the philippines
7384412 were going to settle down in california but i still have a lot of things i want to take care of
7384413 of course not i am just getting married its not going to change anything to me other than my legal status the philippines is my home and thats really where my heart is
7384414 marami ngang gustong kumuha sa mga girls ko na mag model at gumawa ng commercials si xuxa kasi shes already 15 at 5 8 na ang height niya si zarah naman 13 years old pero 5 7 na siya malalaki ang mga dalagita ko di ba pero ayaw nilang maging beauty queen at supermodel tulad ng ina nila iba ang gusto nilang gawin
7384415 wala namang regrets kung bakit hindi ko itinuluy tuloy ang modeling career ko noon tapos na yon and i made my choice mas pinili ko ang manatili rito at magkaroon ng malaking pamilya
7384416 tulad nga rin sa mga anak ko wala namang problema sa akin kasi may mga choices naman sila its good na gusto nilang maging professionals pero kung ang buhay ko noon ay tulad ng buhay ng mga anak ko ngayon baka itinuloy ko ang pag aaral ko at hindi ako naging beauty queen at supermodel siguro nga nasa plano ng diyos na ganito ang maging buhay ko
7384417 ganito na lang mahal ko ang anak ko at bilang ina ay nagiging protective lang ako
7384418 since alam naman na nila ang mga dapat gawin nasa kanila na yon ipinapasa diyos ko na lang lahat hindi naman ako ang mananagot sa diyos baling araw e
7384419 nakapag guest na nga ako before sa the buzz di ba pero hindi naman na namin ginawang public ang pag aayos namin personal kaming nag usap at marami akong sinabi sa kanya na tinanggap naman niya siyempre bilang kapatid ni joey dapat lang na ipagtanggol ko siya kaya alls well that ends well sa amin ni kris
7384420 isa lang pantasya sa akin ang maging singer noon pero mukhang matutupad na yon dahil sa show na ito babaklain ko lang para mag enjoy ang mga tao sa akin
7384421 nakakatuwa kasi kasama ko as contestants sina mmda chairman bayani fernando ang aking kapatid na si joey marquez si ms cory quirino at carlene aguilar pare pareho kaming mga hindi singers kaya pabonggahan na lang kami
7384422 last week optus chief executive paul osullivan said telstra was holding up the nbn by not complying with its network information requirements
7384423 this confirmation demonstrates that mr osullivans claim was false and he should apologise for misleading the public
7384424 im flabbergasted that telstra is claiming optus is peddling falsehoods when you look at the history how can they have the gall to claim that the delay is our fault

7384439 look i dont want to jinx him or anything because hes playing at such a high level but people have to understand sometimes preseason is all about mistakes
7384440 you dont get that many plays usually everybody is tired from camp and there isnt a whole lot of game planning to get people free the way you want
7384441 so its rare just very rare its not something you see a lot in the situations youre in during the preseason thats for sure im really excited about the way hes playing i think we all are
7384442 thats kind of the biggest thing not turning the ball over sometimes youre going to get tipped passes and things like that but im happy with that thats kind of the goal
7384443 and heres the thing i think people can recognize how well hes playing but you have to see the guys in front of him theyre doing a tremendous job giving him time to throw and guys are making plays when the balls in the air
7384444 but i think everybodys got the feeling when they look at him in the huddle that were going to be able to move the ball
7384445 you have a guy hes like john elway that way who doesnt worry about his percentages all the time his stats who believes he can do it wants to do it and has the arm strength to do it so you work to use the whole field and see the opportunities that will come because of that
7384446 i dont know ive never been a big fumbler in the pocket or anything like that
7384447 i didnt feel like i looked at that more than anything else in the offseason you just work to limit mistakes and find the matchups i dont want to make mistakes i want us to move the ball put up some points and get some wins thats always the bottom line
7384448 everybody knows if youre the quarterback you cant turn the ball over if you do youre not going to be the quarterback

7384457 here we are again starting a new season hofstra is a very solid team from one of the best conferences in the football championship subdivision offensively and defensively they are a very solid team and they are well coached one that can move the ball offensively and is very stingy on defense
7384458 were just going to go out and play to the whistle and make plays and the big plays will happen if we just go out there and play our game but thats something that were looking forward to this year the ability to make some more big plays offensively than weve had previously and last year especially
7384459 i dont think as a coach you ever feel like youre ready weve got to go and play it thats the thing i think the kids are ready to go play and theyre anxious to go play there are some more things that we have to do that we want to continue to work on these next few days to prepare and to get ourselves the most prepared that we can going into thursday but im ready to start playing
7384460 i thought preseason camp pretty much went the same as all preseason camps go you install your offense and defense i thought our guys came back in pretty good shape i thought they worked hard and i liked their approach during training camp i thought it was very business like this is a group that to me i dont think is real flamboyant but i think they have confidence they understand the mission that were on and i think they just want to go out and give their best effort each and every time that we play i think that happens when you have 14 seniors 12 fifth year seniors i think when you have that kind of leadership that kind of focus it leads to having the kind of preseason that we did we came through preseason in pretty good shape with minimal injuries
7384461 i think thats going to play out as we play our 12 games and guys are going to step up but were not sure who theyre going to be yet i think we have an identity were going to play sound fundamental get after you football thats our identity as a program and again i think if you want to talk in terms of this particular team the way ive seen them is that they are a very business like team its a team that has a mission for this season and i see them very focused on what they want to do and theyve had fun while theyve done it but theyre very business like in what they want to accomplish
7384462 i think the goal is the same as it is every year we want to win a big east championship and then just win one game at a time if we can win one game at a time and really focus on that last week doesnt matter this week is the same kind of feeling that we had a year ago we just want to take it one game at a time and at least well be giving ourselves that opportunity to be the best that we can be week in and week out
7384463 i havent but the team knows that this game is just like any other and we only have 12 games and this week is just as important as any of the other eleven that we play because week 1 counts as much as any other week what were trying to do is get as many wins as we can in those 12 opportunities and this one doesnt count any more that any of the other 12 that we will be playing for us not to goo out and play our best and give our best effort that would not be the mission that would not be the frame of mind that we had for our program
7384464 its tough to see seniors go out like that they put everything they have into the program while they are here and when we got to the bowl game we went in and we were expecting to win and we lost but thats football you win some and you lose some but like you said its a bitter taste you dont want to see your seniors go out that way with a loss in their last game ever when they put on the uniform for the last time
7384465 our goals are to win a big east championship go to a bowl game and win the bowl game not only do we expect it but i think our fans expect us to win too
7384466 there was a lot of stuff we did as players other than what the coaches required us to do we have a lot of guys with experience and a lot of younger guys that need to learn what it takes to win its important for us to keep doing what weve done and make this an every year type of thing and people need to carry on the leadership we have to pass on the work ethic we learned last year that got us to where we were
7384467 no i play offense straight up and im going to do my job im not going to sit here and say im going to force the ball to ellis thats just dumb on my part im going to do whatever it takes to win whether that means running the ball 100 times or throwing it 100 times i dont care as long as we get the win
7384468 yes youve got to get sick of banging with your team mates and the offensive line its about time for us to be hitting someone with different color jerseys i think were excited about that you drag on through camp watch all the film and we got an early jump on hofstra now i think were ready to just go out there and set the tone for the season
7384469 of course appalachian state is still fresh in everyones minds from last year so coach is always reminding us that they beat michigan hofstra has a lot of i a football bowl subdivision transfers so the fact that its i aa football or football championship subdivision doesnt factor in as much with hofstra because the truth is the get a lot of transfers from programs that are at our level mississippi state transfers and transfers like that

7384483 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7384484 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7384485 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7384486 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7384487 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7384488 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7384489 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7384490 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7384491 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7384492 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track

7384496 amalgam ist besser als sein ruf die aktuelle studie zeigt auf dass der f llstoff nicht sch dlicher ist als andere materialien es gibt und das muss man auch ganz klar sagen patienten die auf amalgam allergisch reagieren die amalgam nicht vertragen gleiches gilt aber auch f r f llungen aus gold oder aus kunststoff
7384497 amalgam enth lt quecksilber und das gelangt ber den zahn in den k rper dabei handelt es sich aber um anorganisches quecksilber aus legierungen und dies ist deutlich weniger sch dlich als organisches quecksilber das wir durch nahrung aufnehmen zum beispiel durch fisch
7384498 wer keine beschwerden hat sollte das amalgam auf alle f lle in seinem zahn belassen auch der austausch kann probleme mit sich bringen zum beispiel geht zahnsubstanz verloren und es gibt auch eine reihe von patienten die auf die neuen f llstoffe allergisch reagieren zum beispiel auf kunststoffe
7384499 ganz wichtig ist die eigenen f higkeiten die handwerklichen f higkeiten und den zeitbedarf realistisch einzusch tzen nur die arbeiten zu machen die man tats chlich kann arbeiten gut zu planen und nat rlich auch wenn freunde und verwandte mithelfen das die gut versichert sind
7384500 ich w rde in jedem fall empfehlen diese ger te vorher beim ausleiher auszuprobieren weil es handelt sich um solche sachen wie ein kernbohrer oder trennschleifer oder eine r ttelplatte die hat man vorher noch nie gesehen geschweige denn in der hand gehabt und wie soll man damit umgehen
7384501 eingriffe in die bausubstanz d rfen gar nicht gemacht werden das ist immer eine sache f r profis und auch sonst sollte man im zweifelsfall den fachmann hinzuziehen sei es der architekt oder auch der statiker des hauses elektroarbeiten d rfen an neubauten berhaupt nicht von laien durchgef hrt werden das ist auf jeden fall sache eines fachmanns
7384502 selber hand anlegen kann man zum beispiel bei dekorativen arbeiten sp ter in der innenausstattung beispielsweise wenn es um das tapezieren geht
7384503 wichtig ist ja dass man hinterher in sein haus auch gesund einziehen kann ich denke ein muss sind sicherheitsschuhe festes schuhwerk mit stahlkappen und dann je nachdem was f r arbeiten man ausf hrt geh rschutz augenschutz oder ein helm und schutzhandschuhe
7384504 ein guter lotse ist der check bauen im internet unter www check bauen de zehn schritte f r kosteng nstiges und qualit tsgerechtes bauen hier kommt es vor allen dingen darauf an dass man mit kompetenten fachleuten mit einer sorgf ltigen planung und gut abgestimmt mit allen beteiligten baut

7384615 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether barack obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7384616 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7384617 joe biden believes the war was a mistake john mccain would still do it all over again joe biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years if barack obama and joe biden had set iraq policy these last six years rather than george bush and john mccain we wouldnt be in the hole were in today
7384618 the president always has the right to act preemptively if we are in imminent danger if they are coming up over the hill he can respond if troops are coming out of tijuana heading north we can respond if they are coming down from toronto we can respond if missiles are on their way we can respond but that is not the way i hear it being used here we are talking about preemption as if we are adopting a policy

7384620 we have our fighting men and women in place and we are told by the way the president will not take them home so lets cut off the support for them so they have no guns no bullets no ability to fight a war and no one is willing to do that
7384621 i cant even think about how ill get through tomorrow or ill start freaking out i just have to get through today
7384622 gage you better watch out your moms about to blow her top
7384623 im so done with this put me on a plane and send me home
7384624 obviously it has gone on quite a while and theres a great deal of money thats gone by right now
7384625 when i took the job at the university of miami i was going to hold everyone to a higher standard than the rest of the country in regards to academically curfew study hall and doing the right things in study hall
7384626 im sorry what happened i wish i could take it back but i cant
7384627 the rules are set for everyone i knew what the rules are im just like any other player on the team
7384628 i have some friends from my hometown of new orleans who gave them to me as a joke
7384629 they live in the charlotte area now and were telling me it was carolinas year this year and they sent them to me after the carolina preseason game this year
7384630 because i use them as a reminder to myself that its not their year its going to be our year
7384631 really though they give me a reminder that everybody in this league is working toward the same goal and you can never ever lose sight of that
7384632 you see what happens with guys like reggie wayne that get better and better and better as they learn the system
7384633 youve got to admire the way he got it done after marvin harrison went out last season
7384634 its hard to understand how it works because last year there wasnt as much movement
7384635 theres a lot more turnover although its exciting for the playoffs it also restructures how we look at the overall season so now the regular season has a lot less meaning
7384636 if its going to be the playoffs i think its a lot more fun to have the volatility
7384637 but maybe the big swings early on maybe make it not quite so severe it might be more pleasing to everybody but im pretty happy with it so far
7384638 the way the points are set up now you set yourself up for the playoffs during the regular season just like any sport and once the playoffs start you have to perform
7384639 but i dont see how anyone can come up with a perfect system someone will get the bad end of the deal
7384640 at times i think some people sought for me to make every play
7384641 i was one of 11 out there but when much is expected then those type of words and feelings come with it and youre held to a higher standard i understand that i took the accolades so at the same time i have to take the criticisms
7384642 a lot of times when a guy gets a change of scenery its a fresh start and he has something to prove to everybody ive heard the knock on him but the thing i have to go by is what i see here on the field
7384643 since hes been here with us his attitude has been good hes helping the younger players playing the defense the way we want it and hes giving good effort and i think if we are cognizant of the fact that he might not be able to play 100 plays in a game and needs a breather we can get somebody else out there so he can catch his breath then still get good production out of him
7384644 ive had a long career as far as snaps go
7384645 ive had several seasons over 1 000 snaps being in those trenches that wears on you theres nothing wrong with a rotation theres no need for me to be out there playing on a half tank when theres more than one qualified guy next to me capable of handling some of the snaps
7384646 if they want to talk about it then ill talk about it if not theres no need for me to discuss it
7384647 in a 4 3 it allowed me to be more aggressive
7384648 its a big change from playing a tilt cock nose with an attacking pass rush style to playing a zero technique with a lot more man reading and pre snap reads thats been a transition for me
7384649 theyre detroit fans and if theyre not rooting for the home team what are they doing here
7384650 its expected but i dont play for the lions anymore i play for the browns maybe if i was a lion id be a little disappointed
7384651 thats what we shoot for two out of three and move on to the next one
7384652 he goes out and you know youre going to get a quality start
7384653 to go 4 2 and get three games ahead of second place los angeles is a good thing
7384654 i gave one up early but the early runs put a little less stress on you
7384655 we came out swinging today and i started putting pressure on them
7384656 first rule of taekwondo you cannot kick the referee in the head
7384657 underperformed the likes of which we have never seen from a u s track and field team
7384658 it would definitely be cool to have two guys from the same school there
7384659 but i would much rather him go than i go he pulls this team together i mean i cant be successful without him he can be successful without me
7384660 if i win chase and i are going to share the trophy by steve wieberg usa today
7384661 youve got justin smith youve got justin gage and brad smith who probably was the greatest player here ever
7384662 ive never had an athlete an explosive athlete like this in 30 years of coaching
7384663 but explosion wise as a guy who can do it all on offense kickoffs punt returns catching the ball ive never seen a guy like maclin
7384664 i tell you what i wouldnt hesitate to say he might be the best athlete weve ever had
7384665 a lot of people were double and triple teaming him and we still found ways to get him the ball whether it be on reverses or running plays out of the backfield and if they start double or triple teaming him whos going to cover chase coffman the tigers preseason all america tight end and tommy saunders their sure handed senior wide receiver and jared perry who was an honorable mention freshman all america receiver in 2006
7384666 when everybody knows a guy is good and theyve done some things in the game plan to take him out and he still gets his yards hes really good
7384667 i mean i wasnt no high class gang banger or anything like that
7384668 but yeah i was a little kid out there on the street 11 12 13 years old i never got into any big legal trouble or anything just fighting that kind of stuff i never stole anything i never robbed anybody i never shot anybody
7384669 theres a few locked up a few still out there doing what they were doing a few with babies
7384670 im not going to change who i am but there were some things i had to sacrifice in order to fit in all of us had to make sacrifices
7384671 it never was about my mom not caring it was just that sometimes personalities clash
7384672 i just needed a change its better since we dont live together its a lot better
7384673 hell be able to read defenses get open more run better routes when people man up on him because he has worked on his fundamentals and theyre so much better
7384674 i look back and there must have been 20 times last year that i know of when somebody made a shoestring tackle
7384675 if he breaks 10 more tackles hes probably got 10 more touchdowns because nobodys catching him
7384676 roland when he was a sophomore you knew he was good and time proved that he was

7384680 well now you are definitely a mum youve got one of those stories
7384681 but i dont have a coach or training partner worse yet i dont have the time

7384695 cada jogador deve defender seus interesses e robinho bem grandinho para isso n o uma crian a respeito o muito porque passei por situa es similares limites
7384696 eu estiquei a perna um pouco depois do gol e senti uma dor no joelho tomara que n o seja nada mais s rio
7384697 o jogador tem que morrer al dentro de campo jogando pelo time
7384698 vi a batalha dos aflitos na concentra o do s o paulo agora pude vivenciar um pouco isso esse est dio gremista tem a cor vermelha mas do gr mio fazer gol aos 48 min n o f cil
7384699 desde que cheguei quarta e domingo quarta e domingo n o d tempo de fazer jogadas ensaiadas finaliza o eu confio nos jogadores e eles n o tiveram culpa daquilo que receberam esses atletas s o mais v timas do que perdedores voc s puderam perceber a disparidade entre as duas equipes hoje domingo no preparo f sico
7384700 eu nunca peguei coisa boa sempre pego os clubes em situa o dif cil vai custar tempo mas vamos sair disso mais dif cil brigar embaixo porque o sofrimento maior voc n o dorme porque planeja e n o sai do jeito que voc quer se eles ca rem para a segunda divis o v o perder mercado e ningu m quer isso eles n o querem perder
7384701 um jogo que n s temos interesse mas a prioridade outra a sul americana tira o foco do time mas temos de respeitar porque um direito que o clube conquistou
7384702 quando sa mos de porto alegre para enfrentar flamengo e n utico a diferen a era de cinco pontos e continua sendo ent o o empate aqui que a princ pio seria um mau neg cio acabou sendo bom inclusive pela circunst ncia em que foi conseguido
7384703 conversei bastante com o abade durante o jogo hoje domingo e isso valido s vezes voc vai conversar na boa e o juiz te xinga te d o cart o
7384704 a maioria dos cart es que eu tomei foi por culpa minha acabo ficando nervoso durante a partida uma coisa minha tenho que tomar cuidado ficar mais tranq ilo isso que estou fazendo e espero continuar assim
7384705 uma coisa fazer escola e outra n o colocar a regra em pratica se a falta existe tem que dar temos que ter interpreta o
7384706 aqui na am rica do sul os jogadores chamam para o drible e isso aumenta o n mero de faltas na europa o jogo s de mudan a de dire o lan amentos em velocidade por isso tem menos faltas
7384707 sab amos que seria um jogo dif cil pois o botafogo fez duas contrata es que se encaixaram equipe que foram carlos alberto e gil n s viemos de uma boa seq ncia mas o empate no final foi um resultado importante para n s e premiou o esfor o dos atletas est vamos errando alguns passes mas isso faz parte
7384708 queremos ganhar sempre mas temos de saber que estamos jogando contra um advers rio qualificado sab amos que o jogo seria dif cil mas suportamos bem os 90 minutos talvez por causa da nsia de sair com a vit ria o empate tenha ficado com um sabor amargo mas estamos satisfeitos porque est vamos perdendo o jogo e conseguimos o empate
7384709 eles demonstram realmente que querem fazer parte de um grupo o ballack ainda tem um problema no p e jogou os 90 minutos superou se lampard teve uma pequena les o aos 30min e suportou bem essien que n o treina h alguns dias pois est voltando de les o fez um treino na sexta e s bado e se colocou disposi o
7384710 isso mostra realmente o esp rito da equipe do chelsea fiquei contente com o grupo e como conquistaram os tr s pontos foi um excelente resultado fora de casa
7384711 as equipes que jogam em casa aqui na inglaterra pressionam muito isso faz com que seus jogadores tenham atitudes mais fortes fizemos o gol logo no in cio e eles tiveram que pressionar o wigan tem jogadores no aspecto f sico avantajados com muito jogo ereo foi uma partida muito disputada dentro daquilo que conhecemos do futebol ingl s
7384712 pedimos sua imediata libera o e acompanharemos este caso de muito perto
7384713 estamos decepcionados porque a china n o aproveitou os jogos ol mpicos para demonstrar maior toler ncia e mais abertura
7384714 o desempenho hoje foi muito mais de dedica o do que outra coisa em um campo com problemas com um gramado dif cil de jogar n o foi um jogo hoje foi uma verdadeira batalha por isso o jogo hoje foi muito mais para resultado do que de qualquer avalia o t cnica
7384715 n o vou atribuir o mau jogo qualidade do gramado vou atribuir a um futebol ao meu ver que n o andou com a qualidade com que esper vamos
7384716 o gr mio teve a indigna o e isso pesou a seu favor mas n o foi suficiente tem que ter qualidade articula o no meio de campo e jogadas com in cio meio e fim isso n o foi apresentado hoje tamb m pela m qualidade do gramado que n o permitiu toque de bola
7384717 there were photographers there and i told them exactly where i was going to go i said right there make sure you wait for me there its just a positive attitude
7384718 they kept telling me push push push and i was pushing to the limit
7384719 that was fun a lot of fun oh my god this is awesome weve been close so often we never lost faith this is great for detroit
7384720 we would not have won this race if helio hadnt driven the wheels off it when he needed to we will keep going and see where we end up at the end of the year
7384721 i think our approach next weekend is the same we go for broke thats the only thing that is going to get us where we need to be
7384722 it was definitely a bad day we lost a ton of points
7384723 this is a race thats very tough unfortunately we got the bad end of the stick i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
7384724 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
7384725 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
7384726 im not upset with anybody particularly we just did absolutely nothing right
7384727 everything that you get in this game youve earned whether it be a touchdown a win whatever it is
7384728 in some sense it is satisfying in that light but trust me theres a lot of work ahead and i know that probably just as much as everybody around here theres going to be some ups and downs but youve just got to stay mentally tough and grind through it thats where my mind set is right now
7384729 we feel like he gives us the best chance to win
7384730 hes picked up our system ill have to keep repeating this but its a learning curve for a quarterback in this league hes going to see some things he hasnt seen before but i think matt is the kind of guy who might get fooled once but the next time it comes up hes going to be able to handle it i really anticipate that we wont see the gaffes that a lot of people think
7384731 he just shook it off and said im glad i got that one out of the way in the preseason
7384732 hes got a very good outlook about the game of football hes got a good understanding to play quarterback in this league hes prepared for it hes mature beyond his years and itll be a great season for him to come in and be out leader
7384733 hes going to have his growing pains just like anybody
7384734 you look at peyton manning in his first year he struggled i just hope the fans and the media give this guy a chance hes not going to go out there and be a hall of famer every game this year hes going to have some mistakes and were going to help him out as much as possible
7384735 were going to play against some really good players and theres really good coaches on other teams as well
7384736 so theres going to be good schemes and sometimes were not going to be at our best but youve got to learn from those mistakes and youve got to understand that theyre going to happen and youve got to bounce back from them as quickly as you can
7384737 the travers is certainly the second most prestigious 3 year old race next to the kentucky derby
7384738 when youve been around horses for a long time the really good ones do things very differently than the usual ones this one from day 1 has shown that he never did anything to disappoint me it was an unfortunate thing in kentucky
7384739 ya saya sebagai orang islam tapi apa salah saya berkawan dengan orang kristian buddha atau hindu agama kita tidak pernah melarang kita dari berkawan dengan orang beragama lain
7384740 definitely it is way above expectations the consensus among economists was that inflation in july will hit 7 8 percent
7384741 this gives the monetary authorities more reasons to push for a rate hike
7384742 among the contributing factors for julys inflation were the substantial rise in the electricity tariff announced by the government and the knock on effect from the price increase of petrol and diesel
7384743 anwar has been playing the right issues najib continues to attack anwar but the latter is talking about unity and progress the crowd is swelling on this cool night change is here anwar urges voters to vote early asking supporters not to be overconfident must pray more and focus on real issues bn has lost touch with the masses

7384746 he will win for sure because everybody knows the sodomy case is just a trick by the government and its his home ground
7384747 my guess is the majority will be slightly reduced because of dirty politics but some of my customers seem to be too idealistic and maybe they want some change in government since they are asking to bet on higher majorities
7384748 we need to factor in that the government will spend a lot of money trying to buy over voters and its a three way fight which is always a spoiler
7384749 malaysia bookies say anwar a safe bet in local poll
7384750 we are still on track for sept 16 and boasting during his night campaign rallies in permatang pauh of the events that will take place from the time he wins the by election right up to pakatan ousting the barisan nasional government led by prime minister datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi
7384751 if anwar wins the chances are that more bn mps will feel that he can meet the sept 16 deadline
7384752 whether he can get more than 30 mps to defect is another matter
7384753 there are also mps from umno mca and also gerakan

7384791 its a great relief and were happy that hes coming home
7384792 the issues of tibet and freedom of speech in china are still there but it will be nice to have him home so we can work on them together
7384793 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond

7384807 there was no fundamental factor behind the rally in jgbs
7384808 it was just thatsomeone bought back bond futures for a technical reason and thatalso sparked buying in the cash market

7384813 we want to make a lot of money so lets make a good game
7384814 were going to make the best game we possibly can make
7384815 i believe the problem is institutional that individually almost everyone in the industry would rather do something very original than something imitative but the huge budgets and corporate decision making structures push us into the same narrow alleys

7384821 arent you tired of going through that conversation over and over again
7384822 isnt it just more interesting and fun to work on something new rather than something exactly the same as the last game you produced or the last ten games
7384823 lets get that fun back lets get that passion back its our industry lets take it back
7384824 i feel like were squandering the promise of games weve been saying for years that its an art form but then we as an industry do as much as we can to disprove what were saying
7384825 i like violent games as much as the next non psychopathic gamer but with the whole range of human experience is there nothing else nothing else that we can concentrate on it would be like if the film industry did nothing but big budget blockbusters we can do better than this we should be doing better than this
7384826 every time weve settled for the easy idea rather than search for the harder innovative idea or every time as a gamer in a store youve reached for the sequel rather than the new game next to it everyone is at fault to some extent and shame on us
7384827 we need to fight conservative ideas at every point from brainstorming to pitch meetings even just when talking to a friend be subversive if you invent a better mousetrap other developers will see it and theyll use it and the innovation will spread until its the standard and be an evangelist

7384836 it is unusual for a retailer of tescos size tohave not consistently implemented the technology across theboard and to have taken such a long time to install it
7384837 were certainly sad with the results for flagship and whats happened with hellgate because at the time we signed it we were trying to get involved in a very complicated relationship between namco and flagship we were coming late to the party and trying to do whatever we could to sprinkle the game magic on the project and get it headed in the right direction i think thats an example where all three parties had the best interest of the game in mind and sometimes the game doesnt work out hellgate is still an incredible concept
7384838 we were co publishing with namco im not going to dodge a bullet we had people who were actively working with them on the title we thought it would have been slightly higher quality than it turned out to be and i think the problem with the game was that by the time it got really good we were four to six months post release that was too late wed lost the fanbase it was strictly an issue of the gameplay and game quality needing to be higher at the start unfortunately flagship was in a situation where they werent in a position to hold the game any longer and the situation kind of took over
7384839 the guys who worked on it spent thousands of hours trying to make that concept work and sometimes we just dont see something sometimes we just didnt take enough time sometimes things dont work out the way you expect its kind of like a film with all big stars on the script it should be successful but the movie doesnt turn out as good as everybody hoped thats why eap takes a portfolio approach with its games you have to place a lot of bets and hope for a lot of hits

7384869 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
7384870 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
7384871 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought
7384872 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
7384873 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on perceiving beauty in the environment
7384874 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
7384875 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them
7384876 but there are practical and ethical constraints around how much alcohol we can give people in the lab
7384877 democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want and deserve to get it good and hard

7384900 we also heated the sample differently the oxygen bearing compound presumably perchlorate might have been there but we might have destroyed it when we were looking for organic compounds
7384901 were not going to be looking for the organic compounds were going to use the same heating plan that we did on the first sample
7384902 in addition to looking for oxygen were going to look for chlorine

7385047 even at the same location the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 feet 1 52m above the ground and different again from 10 feet or 50 feet above the ground
7385048 particularly in the presence of vegetation say in a rainforest the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation
7385049 a reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 feet of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation to measure sat surface air temperature we have to agree on what it is and as far as i know no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted
7385050 death rates were around 50 80 per 100 000 in june july and august winter while they were around 30 50 per 100 000 in the rest of the year including the summer
7385051 it is understandable that more deaths would occur in winters in cold or temperate regions but even in a subtropical region as indicated in this study a decrease in temperatures in winters may increase human mortality
7385052 d eaths in those diagnosed with heart failure were higher in winter and lowest in summer
7385053 cold related deaths are far more numerous than heat related deaths in the united states europe and almost all countries outside the tropics and almost all of them are due to common illnesses that are increased by cold
7385054 since heat related deaths are generally much fewer than cold related deaths
7385055 the overall effect of global warming on health can be expected to be a beneficial one
7385056 the rise in temperature of 3 6 f expected over the next 50 years would increase heat related deaths in britain by about 2 000 but reduce cold related deaths by about 20 000

7385058 pornography in the classroom peter rosengren editor of the catholic churchs the record newspaper said such lessons were indicative of societys over sexualisation of children
7385059 its outrageous mr cremer said of the program that is taught by medical students to about 10 000 children each year at about 150 public and private schools statewide
7385060 my concern is the ethical standards and moral values of an education system that believes it has the right without my permission to get my daughter to put condoms on plastic penises
7385061 thats pornography in the classroom he said secular philosophy about sex education was problematic because it only focused on preventing pregnancy and disease when it should also involve morality
7385062 our reception of the prisoners tomorrow will be like a national wedding

7385075 im really disappointed that the number of retailers selling alcohol to minors has doubled in the last year

7385078 there is agreement in the scottish parliament that a single body should have responsibility for promoting the arts and creative industries yet the snp has botched the handling of the creative scotland bill this should have been a very simple process

7385080 ministers must now work with other parties in the scottish parliament and organisations within the creative industries to agree a way forward

7385090 although i welcome the scottish governments commitment to encouraging scots out of their cars in favour of greener alternatives it is no substitute for the more comprehensive funding that was previously available to all local authorities to support greener travel
7385091 this was a very difficult decision to make but when we thought about the trouble we would cause to consumers and our partners we decided it was not right for us to keep going with such a small presence
7385092 while these versions did protect against the vulnerabilities discussed in the bulletin they lacked other important security and reliability updates
7385093 this only affected the packages on the microsoft download centre microsoft update and office update contained and were distributing the correct versions of the binaries and did not need to be updated

7385095 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
7385096 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
7385097 what if those machines had a small amount of intelligence and they could assemble themselves into various shapes and were capable of movement or locomotion
7385098 if you had enough of them you could create arbitrary shapes and have the assembly of machines that could take on any form and move in arbitrary ways
7385099 if we could really cut the cord and not be burdened with all these heavy batteries and not worry if you have the charger if we could transmit power wirelessly think of all the machines that would become much more efficient
7385100 htc would not release a smartphone in this day and age that lacked bluetooth support
7385101 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
7385102 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
7385103 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost
7385104 the line is closed this is the end of the line

7385108 as a public service lets start filling up the pool
7385109 passing the mantle because the end of the pool is pretty much it for williamsburg and brooklyn people will move across the holland tunnel move across the lincoln tunnel and then theyll see real misfits
7385110 it is an interesting fact that sheep farmers spend their days trying to keep sheep from dying only to eventually kill them anyway
7385111 well these ani mules are gonna die sooner or later so it might as well be sooner
7385112 the most important thing a department chair does is faculty recruiting and faculty retention
7385113 he did that wonderfully well in a period when the university was undergoing a period of retrenchment financially he managed to improve the national ranking of the department
7385114 he did a very good job of keeping them once they came
7385115 what that mostly requires is preserving harmony a lot of departments just kind of blow up and explode because people get angry with each other and some of them storm off and leave the department a wreck he managed to make sure that contentious issues didnt become prominent in the department

7385120 mitcham is the first aussie to win diving gold since 1924 but thats not the only thing that makes him a trailblazer
7385121 nbc has made athletes significant others a part of the coverage in the past choosing to spotlight track athlete sanya richards fiancee a love triangle between french and italian swimmers and kerri walshs wedding ring debacle
7385122 mitcham kissed him briefly in the stands and gave him his olympic bouquet later outside the glowing blue water cube matthew mitcham and his partner lachlan fletcher firmly embraced both shedding tears next it was his mother viviens turn to hold her golden boy and more tears fell
7385123 forbid its workers from smoking in order to lower its health care costs but its profit margins depend on big sales to the 65 or so of the population that is overweight or obese
7385124 mostly the visuals feed complacency as overweight as a viewer may feel he or she surely will never fall this far into the potato chip abyss and if the morbidly obese people on screen can drop 100 pounds then even the chubbiest kid on the couch can fit into a swimsuit by summer

7385140 the game dictated that dropping everybody back in it was hard to break them down what ends up opening up when teams drop are outside the box shots like that
7385141 when tino faces up against people people have to be honest because you dont know if hes gonna beat you on the dribble or hes gonna shoot because hes capable of doing both very well
7385142 all i can do is go out there and work hard and be honest and thats what i do or try to do at least

7385154 eh per dai sti ebook non hanno mica ancora un mercato non vale la pena buttarcisi
7385155 would you like to know how much the revenue for ebooks in the us the first quarter of 2008 is i can tell you 2008 q1 over 10 million usd 2006 q1 4 million usd 2004 q1 1 8 usd
7385156 its always at the back of your mind especially as someone who owns a business you wonder whether to keep building and reinvesting
7385157 but it just sits there behind you it doesnt stop you doing anything
7385158 as far as israeli law is concerned it is a part of israel like tel aviv or haifa so why are we even talking about considering giving it back
7385159 we are living here and we believe we will continue to live here and make wine here
7385160 its a tragedy there because there are two nations in one place
7385161 here it was different we never did something wrong to the arabs because when we came here it was empty
7385162 when we started we were pioneers we came here with the governments blessing
7385163 to continue your life here as a normal human being you must decide its business as usual otherwise you leave
7385164 well be angry well be against it but we wont shoot at the israeli army we are not gaza or hebron
7385165 we can live in a smaller israel the real problem is that arabs cant live with israelis they dont want to for them we are always strangers like the crusaders
7385166 about 70 percent say they are not willing to exchange the golan for a real peace treaty so we have good support
7385167 technical arrangements are important but not the heart of the matter water demilitarization open access all these can be fixed in negotiations im speaking about our basic rights here after 40 years this should be on the table
7385168 some people say its ours its biblical its annexed others say the same holiness exists for peace i say find a middle way if not its not a necessity were here to stay
7385169 if there is real peace well welcome syrian riders to ramot ranch
7385170 rangel is late to arrive at this conclusion because he has been comfortable you would be shocked to find out how many people are paying half their income on just rents when the rule of thumb is 30 percent
7385171 what doesnt come out in the wash will come out in the rinse
7385172 the record industry is a very political place at the moment and i am on emi records lots of people have been fired or have taken redundancy recently as the company was taken over by a private equity firm called terra firma many of these people were people assigned to my projects and now i dont quite know whats going on
7385173 u want me 2 will impact your radio waves and digital retailers instantly be the first to own this piece of the abiding sarah mclachlan legacy on august 12th by purchasing u want me 2
7385174 the reality is there probably wont be any more data breach activity than normal were just going to hear and talk about every one now which is a healthy thing because it provides transparency and establishes security performance as a market differentiator but it will be painful for a few years
7385175 while notification is an important mitigation strategy it will not always be the appropriate response to a breach providing notification about low risk breaches can cause undue anxiety and de sensitise individuals to notice
7385176 once an agency and organisation has discovered or suspects that a personal information security breach has occurred they should take immediate common sense steps to limit the breach
7385177 notification can be an important mitigation strategy that has the potential to benefit both the agency or organisation and the individuals affected by a personal information security breach the challenge is to determine when notification is appropriate while notification is an important mitigation strategy it will not always be the appropriate response to a breach providing notification about low risk breaches can cause undue anxiety and de sensitise individuals to notice each incident needs to be considered on a case by case basis to determine whether breach notification is required
7385178 in 12 months sun will not be the same company it is now
7385179 it just doesnt seem like theres any long term strategy over there that will generate revenue growth
7385180 suns sunken stock price creates a relative bargain considering its roughly 4 billion cash on hand sizeable intellectual property and patent portfolio and of course its respected technology and products
7385181 these assets could make it easier for an acquirer to roll the dice or to sell the idea to their shareholders
7385182 is already aligned with sun given its role in manufacturing sparc processors and hardware
7385183 could also give fujitsu or any other potential acquirer an instant open source product line
7385184 there was a need to reduce emissions and server and cooling power costs because server management and sprawl were eating into operational costs and physical rack space
7385185 we did this by server consolidation using virtualisation one of my major key result areas is business continuity and virtualisation will drastically reduce my system re establishment workload immediately following an event
7385186 there was enough budget to replace each server but research found server consolidation was by far the best long term option
7385187 the councils main concern with virtualisation was the all the eggs in one basket problem
7385188 got a bit exuberant about the numbers were not going to impose costs like 50 a week on motorists
7385189 you get to choose the balance and theres no way that we are going to be imposing a 50 cost on motorists i think the level of tolling that the governments talking about on puhoi a motorway extention north of auckland which is about 2 is more reasonable
7385190 if theres going to be tolling where they are paying then government should be looking at whether it can offset that by lower petrol prices
7385191 while nationals ability to issue policies only to have to issue corrections and clarifications of those policies within 24 hours is a source of amusement it is also alarming that a major political party is unwilling to be clear about its real agenda
7385192 so youre probably talking about 20 percent of the new project and relative to the rest of the roading network its sort of less than 2 or 3 percent
7385193 were happy with the growth for this year in the next year well be looking at further opportunities for acquisitions especially around the infrastructures and outsourcing part of our business where a few opportunities have recently come up were interested in some of commander volantes managed services for instance
7385194 theres no place like home theres no place like home

7385196 what do you think the reaction would be if former secretary of state colin powell a republican introduced democrat obama at his big acceptance speech at mile high stadium after being made the nominee
7385197 it would seal the deal it would be the presidency
7385198 new customers with multiple telstra services can receive a discount of 12 months half price off their wireless broadband access

7385209 my cell phone is too big to fit comfortably in my pocket and too small for my fingers its worse if i try to watch movies or do my e mail but if i had 200 to 300 milliliters of catoms i could have it take on the shape of the device that i need at that moment
7385210 to form its smallest shape or even be a little squishy so i can just drop it in my pocket

7385221 we feel like he gives us the best chance to win
7385222 hes picked up our system ill have to keep repeating this but its a learning curve for a quarterback in this league hes going to see some things he hasnt seen before but i think matt is the kind of guy who might get fooled once but the next time it comes up hes going to be able to handle it i really anticipate that we wont see the gaffes that a lot of people think
7385223 he just shook it off and said im glad i got that one out of the way in the preseason
7385224 hes got a very good outlook about the game of football hes got a good understanding to play quarterback in this league hes prepared for it hes mature beyond his years and itll be a great season for him to come in and be out leader
7385225 hes going to have his growing pains just like anybody
7385226 you look at peyton manning in his first year he struggled i just hope the fans and the media give this guy a chance hes not going to go out there and be a hall of famer every game this year hes going to have some mistakes and were going to help him out as much as possible
7385227 we hope were going to make a lot of money because were going to donate all of it to a charity
7385228 there are a variety of other cities across the nation new york san francisco portland that have longstanding car free days but this is the first time were trying the experiment of car free days here in seattle
7385229 to me car free day would mean leave your car and walk or take the bus
7385230 he just had high points he remembered he didnt have a concept of how long he was under there
7385231 we were talking about getting him a little recorder so he could talk about what he remembers and ahhh he doesnt want to go there
7385232 i think alec is out of the woods and allesandro i think hes at the edge of the woods

7385268 more kids raised their hand for ub than penn state
7385269 until turner got the job you didnt hear much about ub
7385270 when turner came here some of the guys started asking about him and paying more attention
7385271 its tough when youre a smaller school in an nfl city
7385272 but if they continue to win people will jump on board theyll get more support and a bigger fan base
7385273 any time you are promoting football and talking football its a positive for the entire community
7385274 what theyve done in a short time period is amazing its been a benefit to our entire region
7385275 weve got the bills weve got the sabres why cant ub be in the same category
7385276 we and others had demonstrated the existence of a dna detection pathway within cells but we are still early in our understanding
7385277 our findings offer an important piece of evidence that this pathway is not only very relevant but it can be the cause of severe autoimmune disease
7385278 just as commensal bacteria outnumber our own cells by four or five orders of magnitude endogenous retroelements outnumber our genes by at least 100 fold
7385279 both have the potential to be detected by the immune system and cause autoimmune disease therefore specific mechanisms evolved to prevent this and trex1 represents the first example of a mechanism to prevent autoimmunity caused by endogenous retroelements

7385281 recognizes that the religious foundations of faith on which america was built are critical underpinnings of our nations most valuable institutions and form the inseparable foundation for americas representative processes legal systems and societal structures
7385282 i was not raised in a religious household for my mother organized religion too often dressed up closed mindedness in the garb of piety cruelty and oppression in the cloak of righteousness however in her mind a working knowledge of the worlds great religions was a necessary part of any well rounded education in our household the bible the koran and the bhagavad gita sat on the shelf alongside books of greek and norse and african mythology on easter or christmas day my mother might drag me to church just as she dragged me to the buddhist temple the chinese new year celebration the shinto shrine and ancient hawaiian burial sites in sum my mother viewed religion through the eyes of the anthropologist it was a phenomenon to be treated with a suitable respect but with a suitable detachment as well
7385283 my faith is complicated by the fact that i didnt grow up in a particular religious tradition when you come at it as an adult your brain mediates a lot and you ask a lot of questions
7385284 i went to a catholic school in a muslim country so i was studying the bible and catechisms by day and at night youd hear the muslim prayer call my mother was a deeply spiritual person her view always was that underlying these religions was a common set of beliefs about how you treat other people and how you aspire to act not just for yourself but also for the greater good i am a follower as well of our civic religion im a big believer in the separation of church and state i am a big believer in our constitutional structure im a law professor at the university of chicago teaching constitutional law

7385288 i really do believe that promoting brown fat growth is a plausible approach to weight control
7385289 to me it is attractive because of its simplicity if more of our fat were brown fat the mouse studies suggest that we would be leaner and better able to resist obesity
7385290 we showed that brown fat and white fat have completely different origins
7385291 brown fat is derived from muscle that was a huge surprise
7385292 the hope is that this research will lead to better ways to treat obesity especially for people who are overweight because of their genes
7385293 right now there are not many good options for these people
7385294 answers to these questions would take us a step closer to the ultimate goal of promoting the brown fat lineage as a potential way of counteracting obesity
7385295 we know that we can stimulate the production of brown fat in mice
7385296 it is not unreasonable to think that we can also do this in humans
7385297 thanks for sharing such lively genuine conversations about the work of real psychiatrists

7385306 i have been looking for work at home for years i couldnt find anything hiremymom has opened up a whole new world of legitimate work at home opportunities i have been working on a project since the end of june that i found through hiremymom i am very excited about hiremymom and am continually amazed by the variety of projects and jobs that they find for their members
7385307 thank you hiremymom com for opening up a new career door for me our family recently relocated due to my husbands job i needed to find employment but did not want to give up on the possibility of staying home with my sons ages 3 and 4 after only being a member of hiremymom for a few months the perfect opportunity became available to me i now have a great challenging part time job and i wont have to miss those special times with my kids women can have it all
7385308 i just started last week working as a link exchange specialist from a posting on hiremymom
7385309 he didnt take input from the team he was trying to drive all the decisions it was undermining the team and i personally felt underutilized
7385310 we hire people that we believe can do the job
7385311 if we dont allow them to use all the tools in their toolbox or we try to pigeonhole people into doing it the way weve always done it then were doing a disservice to the individual the team and the organization
7385312 these were very marketable people who would never have considered leaving the company if it hadnt been for the outsourcing
7385313 a global coalition of designers educators researchers engineers and corporate leaders working together to create positive environmental and social impact
7385314 what we want to do is really get to the point where when we talk about sustainability we are putting it at the same level as thinking about organizational behavior brand design technology in business and then human factors so it should just be one of the many frameworks that we are using
7385315 how to interpret broad corporate sustainability initiatives at the ground level and tactical level and how does that actually impact making the product design we were going to pursue so rather than approach the process new and come up with a perspective of our own we decided that it would be best to source the collective thought capital available
7385316 flux between consultancies and industries rather than just inside the designworks team and our efforts

7385327 we have seen a president in the last six plus years who tries to impose his faith on the american people and i think it is a mistake and i will not impose my faith belief on the american people i dont believe any president should do that i believe in the separation of church and state
7385328 ive been in courthouses where ive seen the ten commandments ive never had a strong reaction to it but how would muslims or hindus feel if they went into that courthouse so im sensitive to that you know of course it wouldnt offend me because im christian and im certainly not offended by the idea of expressing faith in that circumstance but probably it causes more trouble than good
7385329 i struggle myself with imposing my faith belief the question is whether i as president should impose my views on gay marriage because i know where it comes from im aware of why i believe what i believe and i think there is consensus around this idea of no discrimination partnership benefits civil unions
7385330 i think the people who are powerful in washington big insurance companies big drug companies big oil companies they are not going to negotiate they are not going to give away their power the only way that they are going to give away their power is if we take it away from them and i have been standing up to these people my entire life i have been fighting them my entire life in court rooms and beating them if you want real change you need somebody whos taking these people on and beating them over and over and over

7385338 ive had to read a lot of information on the curriculum and programs as well as the needs of the teachers parents administration and the students
7385339 you have to think about your long term plan and the lessons you have to think about how youre going to work with the students when you have to intervene
7385340 ive been organizing my classroom by doing what i can then asking some of the other teachers a lot of questions

7385344 in the bible institutional power is referred to as the beast which sets itself up to control people and their morals

7385357 to preserve the provinces tidal energy resource i believe the isthmus should be armoured to prevent further erosion
7385358 doing so would preserve for hundreds of years the potential for tidal electricity generation in the minas channel minas passage and minas basin
7385359 the creation of a passage between the chignecto branch of the bay of fundy and the northumberland strait would significantly decrease the amount of tidal flow into the minas branch of the bay of fundy

7385369 sure i finished 2nd but guess whos still leading the drivers championship
7385370 i saw a white plastic bag flying across the track but could not avoid it and it went under the car i couldnt steer for two corners which was extremely dangerous

7385372 incredible a perfect day and i was dueling with kimi too watch out toro rosso comin thru woo
7385373 this was one of the worst races ever for me to finish ninth in a car which is obviously good enough for third is a disaster

7385383 it was an even split a lot felt she would add to the ticket and that it was the least that should be done for her
7385384 but i think her voice is just so much stronger with her not being on the ticket she goes back to the senate and she can push health care she can push so many things thats whats important

7385389 its ok for them to use the frequency they are using it for public safety communications which has priority over data transmission the problem is they failed to notify us a year in advance
7385390 we hired a consulting firm to find the radio frequency for us
7385391 we went through the whole fcc process we did not know plano was on the same frequency so there was no way to inform them about it
7385392 no one has mentioned that plano is a secondary user
7385393 they are using a public safety frequency other entities can use it someone in plano decided to use it for the water system 15 years ago and thought everything would be fine now with the shortage of frequencies we have to share they dont have ownership
7385394 if you were the police chief and i were to tell you to turn the radio off that the police rely on so i could water my yard you would think i was crazy
7385395 if they turn them around they would not hear us
7385396 but the type of materials we need to make the change will cost money and takes time to make the parts and install at every sprinkler site in the city
7385397 it is a sad thing for us that this occurred the demands in plano are far too reaching
7385398 we filed a complaint with the fcc but we cant wait
7385399 we have to get this going if you drive around you will see some areas that are hurting

7385402 it has been in the budget to replace these technologies but with the budget concerns we wanted to spread it out
7385403 its a fiscal concern its not purely a matter of taxpayers because they would have eventually paid anyway but this has forced us to react suddenly

7385416 i think john mccain would be a great candidate for vice president i mean it i know john doesnt like me saying it but the truth of the matter is it is
7385417 i think that this is time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like they do get along
7385418 i think the single most important thing that john kerry has to do is to say that makes sense

7385458 there was another time when another young candidate was running for president and challenging america to cross a new frontier
7385459 he faced public criticism from the preceding democratic president who was widely respected in the party
7385460 ted has been at the forefront of every single cause thats important to democrats for my entire adult life
7385461 having gotten to know him in the senate what i came to realize was hes probably the hardest working senator that we have and during this campaign what ive seen is the sheer joy he gets out of politics he cares so deeply about the people hes fighting for but he also just enjoys being the mix and the give and take
7385462 the man who just spoke is going to be president of the united states and he is going to change this country
7385463 the kennedy family has been with us from the very early days
7385464 every major civil rights battle senator kennedy has been there hes been a warrior hes been a fighter hes been a workhorse for civil rights
7385465 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether barack obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7385466 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7385467 joe biden believes the war was a mistake john mccain would still do it all over again joe biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years if barack obama and joe biden had set iraq policy these last six years rather than george bush and john mccain we wouldnt be in the hole were in today
7385468 the president always has the right to act preemptively if we are in imminent danger if they are coming up over the hill he can respond if troops are coming out of tijuana heading north we can respond if they are coming down from toronto we can respond if missiles are on their way we can respond but that is not the way i hear it being used here we are talking about preemption as if we are adopting a policy
7385469 the power of the purse is useless because it presents us with a hobsons choice
7385470 we have our fighting men and women in place and we are told by the way the president will not take them home so lets cut off the support for them so they have no guns no bullets no ability to fight a war and no one is willing to do that
7385471 baracks whole message is i can stand in everyones shoes
7385472 is remarkably underdeveloped when it comes to talking about mixed racial experience the places in between for those people who are neither black nor white but both the opportunity with obama is maybe we can start to craft this language to break out of that calcified language america has held on to for all these years
7385473 may not be as good as other headliners the first three nights but hopefully it will make clear the choice the american people will face in november
7385474 when people need help they dont ask whether the lawyer is a republican or a democrat they just want the best lawyer i am that lawyer
7385475 adversely on haighs honesty trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer
7385476 that she was not representing the best interests of her family
7385477 my fathers and his attorneys actions have shown me how truly abusive some people can be in the legal profession
7385478 many attorneys believe that zealously representing their clients means pushing all rules of ethics and decency to the limit
7385479 i suspect that if opposing lawyers were to calculate for their clients how much they could save by foregoing what has been called
7385480 uh was that thing important i wish someone would have told me beforehand
7385481 i notice many police officers from each city and washington state patrolmen on the freeways driving while talking on cell phones no hands free device are these cell phones being used for personal business are the officers expected to use these for police business are police officers exempt from the laws we are expected to abide by the cell phone law is a good law
7385482 troopers are sometimes contacted by our dispatch centers via cell phone to direct them to areas and situations that we do not necessarily want broadcast over the radio such as bomb squad and swat situations
7385483 there are other times when our radio frequencies are overcrowded with directing troopers to collisions and other emergencies in times such as these the communication center will utilize the cell phone to contact supervisors to relay information
7385484 remind our troopers of their responsibility to lead by example and use a hands free device whenever possible
7385485 coming from town i have to fight my way off the bus
7385486 why doesnt the bus 36 just go up and down beacon avenue south and not go to rainier beach several people have told me that bus 7 is too noisy with people and theres a lot of trouble on that bus so theyd rather take 36
7385487 when the city redid the bridge approach they made the two left lanes left turn only
7385488 i have noticed that traffic now backs up in the right lane for several blocks in the morning while there is little to no traffic in either of the left two lanes can the city make the middle lane a left turn straight lane again to ease the congestion among other things the backup causes lots of irritating queue jumpers who try to cut in at the last minute
7385489 a good creative idea and one that several people have shared with us unfortunately as weve reviewed it weve found that it presents some challenges from a signals perspective
7385490 simply put this means that one direction only proceeds through on green followed by the opposing direction getting the green light
7385491 would result in more overall congestion and backing up of traffic at the intersection
7385492 it happens all the time kind of like the rain in seattle
7385493 if it breaks down i hope i can get off the damn thing
7385494 its about our fifth time on it we like it
7385495 the air supply system has to work very very hard
7385496 it loses more air out of the system so its unfair to blame the valve its the air system it needs to be replaced
7385497 that is the fastest way to get people to the station
7385498 if you have a ticket for saturday we will refund it
7385499 its just a prejudice about mixing porn and blogging that stops me thats my fault not yours
7385500 because youre crossing the street and they almost hit you
7385501 whatever your action is to be it is evident that you must act now you cannot act in the past and it is essential to the clearness of your mental vision that you dismiss the past
7385502 people appreciate that power has been re balanced away from them that economic fairness has come out of balance and they cant figure out whats going to happen to their kids futures and so i think someone saying corporations have way too much power and workers way too little is a message that everyone actually believes right now and they may not have believed that 10 years ago
7385503 no ones wincing and saying insurance companies are our friends or that wal mart is really trying to help america be better as opposed to the walton family
7385504 i think there is a way to do this without broad brush accusing every employer in america with doing something wrong
7385505 americans have identified who they think is responsible for part of the problems in their lives i think barack obama understands this and i think he needs to say it
7385506 i do think he obama has to hit this harder that the government has to work for workers
7385507 educate voters about john mccains anti worker agenda and elect barack obama
7385508 youre in range you are healthy go see a psychiatrist
7385509 interpretation of acth plasma test in conjunction with cortisol stimulation
7385510 is this one of those tests you know the thing where im given another shot at life find the odds horribly stacked against me wind up a prostitute and die bloodily in hell
7385511 i guess im in though this reality have the same nightlife
7385512 yeah youre declawing me and sending me away on a flimsy excuse my powers are at home and being used by someone else im the pink ranger without a boyfriend and you probably cant hear me anymore because you just dropped me in a street i
7385513 kami kesal kerana pihak universiti menolak pandangan kami sedangkan yang hendak mengenakan pakaian tersebut adalah kalangan mahasiswa bahkan dengan kos rm2 1 juta yang dihabiskan ianya suatu pembaziran
7385514 pihak universiti telah terlebih awal merancang membuat keputusan ini selain menyelaraskan pakaian ini dengan institusi pengajian tinggi
7385515 saya tahu bukan mahasiswa sahaja tidak bersetuju bahkan pensyarah dan kakitangan pun ada yang bantah pembaharuan ini
7385516 ianya bukan bermaksud membuang nilai islam dalam majlis istiadat tahunan ini tetapi ia adalah proses biasa
7385517 kalau nak kata ia bukan imej islam kita tak perlu adakan majlis secara besar besaran seumpama sebelum ini
7385518 buat penyerahan skrol sahaja kerana ia adalah cara kristian lebih memudahkan pihak universiti
7385519 kalau kita buat tahun depan orang tanya kenapa tak buat tahun ini
7385520 im sure you understand that were all only trying to look out for the best interests of the american public general
7385521 after all the stargate program has already cost this country over two point three billion dollars in overall expenses and has provided nothing substantial in the way of return on our investment
7385522 that stargate command has repeatedly failed to grasp some of the finer nuances that the stargate program can offer our country as far as opportunities to advance its goals by offering both the benefits of democracy and the prospects that conditional alliances with some of the other races both human and otherwise with whom the sgc has interacted can provide to all parties involved
7385523 hey giles theres a guy on the phone who wants to talk to you he says someone named hank hayes told him to give you a call
7385524 thank you dawn i greatly appreciate your shrieking like a banshee while summoning me since it would be clearly impossible for me to hear any normally voiced request from my position in the adjoining room
7385525 good evening mister giles my name is george hammond and i am sorry to have to disturb you at so late an hour but a mutual acquaintance of ours president henry hayes suggested that i speak with you as the current head of a group he described as possessing the highest levels of morality and integrity as well as the courage of your convictions regarding a possible solution to a problem of some significance that i am currently being forced to deal with
7385526 if it s not too much trouble id like to explain my current situation in greater detail before i get into exactly why i am calling
7385527 first off i am a general in the united states air force overseeing a highly classified program called stargate command
7385528 all right people the jobs almost done now all we have to do is make a final sweep of the mess here to make sure we haven t missed anybody or anything and we re homeward bound
7385529 i m not sure whether faith will be happier to find out that andrew did remember to restock the ice cream so that she can pig out and eat as much as she wants or that he didn t remember so that she can follow up on her threat to remove some of his favorite body parts
7385530 yeah i can see where she d find that choice a lit
7385531 code red attention all strike team members code red captain kidd has just disappeared under suspicious circumstances i repeat captain kidd has just disappeared under suspicious circumstances
7385532 and please tell me youre here because you guys lost the recipe for blue jello and not because you just found out about some possible apocalypse is heading our way please
7385533 no there is no apocalyptic level event occurring inside any of the regions with which we are familiar oneill
7385534 however we have only just determined within the last two planetary cycles of your planet that one of our geneticists has apparently returned to the vicinity of your planet for the purpose of resuming unauthorized experimentation on human subjects
7385535 the science council first discovered that he had been performing unapproved research on human subjects approximately twenty three of your years ago and forced him to stop all of the projects they discovered he was conducting but it appears that he has returned and resumed his projects
7385536 we are also currently unsure whether he may have managed to abduct any subjects for experimentation since his arrival
7385537 dammit little buddy are you telling me that weve got some little grey asgard doctor frankenstein wannabe maniac out there doing experiments on people
7385538 as i just said oneill we are currently unable to determine whether loki has begun actual experimentation on any human subjects he may have abducted but it would appear that that is indeed the purpose of his return
7385539 take sg 1 and coordinate with commander thors group with regard to this latest
7385540 and make sure that any civilians that may be involved as a result of this lokis interference return to the base with you for proper debriefing
7385541 okay guys lets saddle up and get moving weve got some little grey alien butt to kick and were not getting any younger
7385542 this looks like a set for a channel 57 sci fi saturday morning flick not someplace the demons who grabbed xand would live
7385543 but this is where the energy trail of whatever it was that grabbed xander originated he should be around here somewhere
7385544 shit gonna be mega pissed you wouldn t let him tag along once he hears the girls talking about this place b
7385545 the little nerdd probably go into a geeker gasm thirty seconds after he got here
7385546 right now i just want to find xander and make sure hes okay
7385547 its good to see you guys but i gotta say it took you long enough to show up
7385548 not to worry i can explain the new eye and some other stuff thats happened very easily
7385549 i think that before you try to do anything else first you need to prove you really are xander harris
7385550 just give me a minute to think about how to do that okay
7385551 okay then you want me to convince you that i really am xander harris
7385552 remember back in junior year that gift that you wanted to give me for valentines day when that spell amy cast went all wonky buff
7385553 its really not that important faith we can discuss that later
7385554 right now xander needs to tell us what happened to the demons that kidnapped him and how he got free and exactly how he got his eye back
7385555 come on back in here and we can do the whole show and tell thing y okay guys
7385556 well near as i can tell there was actually only one demon involved faith
7385557 and because it was stupid enough to stick me in that thing there
7385558 its now currently stored in the deep freeze section of the building
7385559 so where exactly is this deep freeze area youre talking about
7385560 because im thinking i want to meet this demon youve been telling us about and show him just how well the scythe here can slice and dice demons
7385561 uh not that i dont fully agree with the whole demon chopping idea buffy
7385562 but after seeing all this stuff here im really thinking we might want to try and talk to this demon first before you start with the slicing and dicing
7385563 cause i cant recall reading about or hearing giles even mention any kind of demon group thats ever used technology very much before let alone one that mightve come up with stuff like whats here in this room
7385564 all of this stuff here looks like its some kind of very advanced technology and im not picking up any kind of aura or even any kind of hint of residual magic from any of the equipment here so im thinking we should probably try to learn as much as we can about whatever kind of demon it is that kidnapped xand and we do it as fast as we can because sending slayers into a fight with demons and finding out that theyre using some kind of unknown technology and not magic like we were expecting them to use would be a really really bad thing to happen
7385565 but before i say anything else about what happened after i got here i think you and i need to talk privately
7385566 uh is there anything the guys need to be watching out for while we talk xand
7385567 nope everything is cool buff you might even say its copasetic
7385568 yeah i think ive got a fairly good idea babe
7385569 ive been the one on the other end of this sort of situation a time or two remember
7385570 theres something really important that happened that you need to know about before we do anything else babe because it could potentially cause some major problems for us
7385571 bend my arm buff try to force it towards the floor
7385572 and i think we might as well sit down since this is probably gonna take a while to explain
7385573 this place isnt something that some mysterious bunch of demons put together
7385574 its something completely different than anything any of us could have expected
7385575 my name is loki test subject designate kappa seventy eight
7385576 it appears that you have also suffered severe damage to your left eye some time prior to the event from which you were just retrieved what were the circumstances surrounding the incident responsible for the damage and when did it occur
7385577 uh first off little grey guy my name isnt test subject designate kappa seventy eight its xander
7385578 and where are we and why did you bring me here
7385579 we are in an abandoned ancient research base which i recently discovered and i transported you here because i need to examine you in order to determine how successful the in vitro fertilization techniques i had previously utilized during your creation were
7385580 i also need to compare your development with that of your clone sibling to determine whether the time your zygote spent in stasis had affected your development in any significant manner
7385581 you are in no physical danger and are currently in a mark nine moobarkerii regeneration chamber for the purposes of repairing the rather extensive amount of damage you have sustained to various parts of your body once the regeneration processes have been completed and you have been restored to the optimum physical condition your body is capable of attaining you will be released
7385582 who are you why are you doing this to me
7385583 i was the commander pro tempore of the caalticha medical facilities of this base until the appearance nine days ago of the aersgaert who is currently waiting outside your regeneration chamber for the completion of your treatment upon his arrival the aersgaert identified himself by the name loki and assumed command of the medical complex section of these facilities after providing a valid command key sequence which allowed him to assume limited command of the non military sections of the base after your arrival here via ring transport he subdued you using a zat n ktel and then transferred you into the moobarkerii regeneration chamber you are currently occupying where it is intended that you undergo standard regeneration treatment for the various injuries you have incurred up to this point in time in order to enable you to achieve your optimum physical potential
7385584 why are you bothering to do that and why are you calling commander
7385585 to answer your second question first commander i initially began your regeneration treatment because loki directed me to do so after transporting you here as he is currently the head of the medical complex as i noted earlier
7385586 are you saying that youre offering me command of this base installation thing y were in
7385587 and thats why youre calling me commander because that little roswell demon that zapped me really shouldnt be in charge of this place
7385588 as i indicated earlier due to the absence of any properly authorized personnel to assume command your being of anqueeta lineage automatically supersedes any non anqueeta personnel with regard to control of this base unless you should order me to allow the existing situation to continue
7385589 uh just how long has it been since any properly authorized command personnel have shown up round here uh bran
7385590 it has been slightly more than 29 486 standard years since the departure of the last anqueeta citizen from this complex commander
7385591 huh so based on what you just said im guessing now that youre not really a flesh and blood type person but are actually some kind of electronic intelligence type of person instead eh bran
7385592 that is correct commander i am an energy sentient or an e s to use the most commonly accepted nomenclatures of the anqueeta culture
7385593 will you be accepting the option i am offering you to assume command of this installation then sir
7385594 well considering that the choice is between me and the roswell refugee out there i guess im gonna have to say yes bran
7385595 i am very glad to hear that congratulations on your assumption of your new command commander
7385596 oh yeah if any more visitors happen to show up check with me before you let them know youre sentient okay and if they do know youre sentient unless theyre some of these properly authorized command personnel you mentioned earlier dont do anything they might try and order you to do until you check with me first even if they are other anqueetas
7385597 uh you havent said anything to this loki character out there about this whole chain of command thing have you
7385598 no sir to the best of my knowledge the aersgaert is not aware of the command authority chain of succession requirements
7385599 and to get back to what you were talking about earlier you were saying something about healing all of the various injuries ive received
7385600 simply that the cellular regeneration treatment that the aersgaert loki had ordered me to initiate on you in order to repair the rather extensive damage you have sustained in addition to healing all of the current injuries you currently exhibit would also regenerate your left eye sir
7385601 given the medical facilities i have available here it is not a particularly difficult procedure to accomplish particularly when initiated in combination with the accelerated cellular regeneration treatment normally used
7385602 prior to initiation of the regeneration treatments however i have several questions that need to be answered
7385603 my preliminary examination detected what appear to be residual traces of several different energy patterns that apparently have been superimposed atop your basic cellular structure at various times in your life as well as indicating the presence of several different piscine gene sequences not normally found in any of the standard anqueetan chromosomal structures with which i am familiar
7385604 in addition my initial analysis of the residual energy patterns present in your body tentatively identifies the first pattern you experienced as similar to one recorded in my files as belonging to an energy based species known to be capable of either temporarily possessing or in some cases forming a long term symbiosis with matter based life forms while the second oldest energy pattern most closely resembles the results of an external attempt at imposition of alternate engrams on an uncooperative test subject
7385605 the third and most recent energy trace which i would estimate you experienced approximately nineteen months ago local time appeared to be composed of several differing energy frequencies superimposed upon each other and evidently was simply incompletely absorbed by your cellular structure and used to destroy the various tumors growing throughout your body as a result of the incomplete integration of the piscine genetic sequences i mentioned i had detected earlier
7385606 excuse me commander but i was of the belief that you were already aware of the widespread existence of cancerous tumors proliferating throughout your body and that you were undergoing the regeneration treatment in order to deal with that problem
7385607 youre telling me i have freakin cancer spread throughout my body
7385608 and im also informing you that the regeneration treatment i can provide you will remove both the tumors and the imperfectly integrated gene fusion responsible for the cancers
7385609 oh okay thats definitely of the good to hear bran
7385610 i wanted to determine whether you wished me to emulate the first two energy patterns you had previously experienced once the regeneration treatment has been completed and this time properly integrate them with both your own engrams and your core cellular structure
7385611 the resulting amalgamation would provide you with whatever benefits you had been looking to achieve when you initially attempted the fusions previously
7385612 well first off youre gonna have to tell what an engram is bran before i can decide whether or not i want you to emulate whatever it is into my cellular structure
7385613 engrams are the neurological equivalents of holographic memory matrices which most physical sapients utilize to store their memories
7385614 my preliminary analysis of your neurological structure would indicate that you experienced an unsuccessful or only partially successful implant when the engram was attempted
7385615 but i am confident that i can not only reconstruct the engram in question and rectify whatever problems you might have experienced but can successfully integrate it into your neurological structure without any problems
7385616 youre saying you can give me the hyenas power and soldier boys memories back without either of them taking over and shoving me off to the side this time around
7385617 sure man to quote the infamous jack t chance give me the juice
7385618 not only used the medical facilities here to heal up all your injuries and give you back your eye he also returned the hyena powers and memories while leaving you completely in charge this time and also made you commander of this whole nifty looking base huh xand
7385619 you know waking up inside the regeneration chamber made me realize how you must have felt waking up inside your coffin when we brought you back the second time
7385620 i know we all said we thought we could imagine how disturbing and upsetting it must have been for you doing that but now i know for sure that we really didnt have any idea of just how freaksome it really was
7385621 and all i can really say is that im so very very sorry that you had to go through something like that darling
7385622 weve all made mistakes but were all getting ourselves straightened out now what with giles insisting that everyone talk to dr crane and theres no point in dragging any of that stuff back up again
7385623 were good and were making things better everyday with what we do so lets not talk about this anymore okay
7385624 you know once we tell willow and the others about all this everything thats happened to you shes so gonna freak and shes gonna want to have the coven check you out once we get back so she can be sure that everythings okay you know
7385625 and then shes definitely gonna want to come back here probably with andrew and the rest of his nerd squad and check out everything to do with this base
7385626 and were also gonna need to see how you do fighting wise and see exactly how strong and fast you are so we can figure out the best way to integrate you into the teams
7385627 yeah i kinda figured all of that out already buff
7385628 and im also thinking once we get home im gonna have to check you out tonight too to make sure that everythings still working properly
7385629 thats probably gonna take several hours at least im guessing
7385630 well its best to be as careful as we can be
7385631 maybe we should plan on spending all day tomorrow seeing just how extensive the changes are hmm staminas really important remember
7385632 but im thinking now that we better get back to the others before willows curiosity about the base her makes her head explode
7385633 oh and buff you probably wont believe this but i think i found the perfect birthday gift for you here while i was wandering around waiting for you guys to show up
7385634 i cant tell you right now youll have to wait and see when you unwrap it monday thats why its called a surprise
7385635 if i told you what it is now then it wouldn t be a surprise now would it
7385636 im sorry to interrupt commander but ive detected an attempt to beam a group into the base by an aersgaert cruiser currently orbiting the planet shall i allow them access
7385637 i thought you were beaming us down to wherever it is that lokis holed up
7385638 that was where i intended for us for us to arrive oneill
7385639 impressive it would appear however that the transfer beam was intercepted and redirected to this point
7385640 so im guessing you guys aren t all that big on the ideas of privacy and private property
7385641 uh actually we were expecting to find someone else entirely in charge
7385642 let me guess you were expecting to find short grey and silents twin brother waiting for you
7385643 look kid if you could just give a call to whoevers are in charge here and tell them wed like to talk to them about the reasons we were beaming down im sure we can get everything straightened out fairly quickly
7385644 well then i guess it must be your lucky day my man since im the guy in charge of everything here
7385645 you tried to enter this base without either permission or authorization which makes you at best trespassers and at worst spies and potential saboteurs
7385646 however seeing that youre in the company of an aersgaert who have generally been considered allies in the past im willing to overlook this infraction this time
7385647 and since im also guessing based on what your guy over there said about expecting to meet up with someone else that you were probably looking for another unwelcome visitor weve had the distinct non pleasure of having show up here so im going to hand him over for you to deal with rather than waste time that i could be spending on things of much greater importance
7385648 you have our most profound apologies for disturbing you base commander
7385649 the asgard were unaware that you had returned to this galaxy and were of the belief that your people had either all ascended or that you had left this galaxy for reasons of your own
7385650 if you have indeed returned and are intending to re establish your presence here the asgard would be most desirous of re establishing formal relations with your people
7385651 but for right now lets go with what i just said okay
7385652 and this is the portable stasis unit i stuffed him into because he was annoying me
7385653 and for your information once its been opened its set to automatically transport itself back here
7385654 id rather not find any bugs or other doodads inside it when it comes back
7385655 and id strongly prefer not to find anyone showing up at my front door and hoping to find out just what it is i might have stored here on base
7385656 ill make a point of telling my bosses all of that
7385657 and you can also tell your bosses well get in touch with them when we feel its the proper time
7385658 uh xander you do realize dont you that you just gave several members of what looked like a united states government military team and their demon friend who was with them the distinct impression that youre the commander of whatever kind of base thing y it is that were in here and that youre also a member of some unknown species that apparently left our solar system thousands and thousands of years ago
7385659 as it happens what i had just finished telling buffy and which i was about to tell you guys before we were so rudely interrupted by those bozos beaming in is that i actually am the commander of this base we re in
7385660 and so since that roswell refuge who kidnapped me had taken command of the cal tech medical facilities here bran who is the energy sentient previously in command of the base here began analyzing my gene sequence in order to initiate the regeneration process and noticed that i possess the anqueetan heritage needed to assume full authority over the base offered it to me and i accepted it and here we are
7385661 i know theyre in the habit of setting up satellite campuses all over the place but i think unless this place is actually just outside disneyland its probably a bit too far for most people to commute to
7385662 actually miss lehane despite his best efforts the commander mangled the proper name of the medical facilities
7385663 the proper designation is the caalticha medical facilities not the cal tech medical facilities
7385664 and since he is the first person of verifiable anqueetan heritage to enter the complex since the previous command staff left 29 486 years ago existing protocols required that he be offered the opportunity to transfer command authority from the aersgaert who was currently overseeing the complex
7385665 you know you never did say exactly how big this base complex is bran
7385666 but there is no reason precluding the release of general information regarding this bases general dimensions or capabilities such as we have been discussing
7385667 and in answer to your questions we are currently located on the floor of the arctic ocean in the area which geographers refer to as the eurasian basin and are approximately 5 300 meters below the ocean surface proper using the terms of measurement you are most familiar with the base itself is approximately five point seven four miles in diameter and extends upwards approximately half a mile above the sea floor and approximately one point six five miles downward in a general cone shape beneath the sea floor with the power generation facilities located approximately three quarters of a mile directly below the primary command complex
7385668 the base currently maintains accommodations suitable to comfortably house approximately twenty thousand inhabitants and can accommodate a significantly larger increase in that figure should the situation arise
7385669 actually the designers intended that the atlantis complex be capable of traveling to wherever the military command staff manning the complex desired and after arrival of functioning as a small self contained city at those destinations for an indefinite period of time
7385670 the base complex atlantis why what seems to be the problem dawn
7385671 thor you mind telling me just what the heck happened back there wherever there was and exactly why you were apologizing to whoever you thought that kid was
7385672 i am unaware of the precise identity of the commander of that city complex we beamed into oneill
7385673 what is of significance importance and something about which i must immediately notify the high council is that it appears that at least one group of ancients have returned to this galaxy
7385674 since the commander did not indicate how long the duration of their stay might be i feel it is imperative that the rest of the high council learn of their return as soon as possible so that any debate that might ensue concerning requests for ancient assistance on several issues of the most pressing concern to the asgard race be accomplished as expeditiously as possible
7385675 uh exactly who are these ancients youre referring to thor
7385676 they are the forebears of your own species doctor jackson
7385677 as i have said this information is of the utmost importance to my race oneill so i must leave for hala immediately
7385678 while i can certainly understand some of your concerns about the feasibility of turning over responsibility for the gate to an international group of civilians jack i think you have to evaluate the situation in the context of exactly who it is we would prefer to see have control over an artifact with this level of power
7385679 the president has had nothing but praise when speaking about this group of people well be meeting and frankly i would find it difficult if not impossible to pick someone more likely to abuse the potential for power the stargate offers its operators than senator kinsey and his cohorts
7385680 well sir its just that i think that were going to have a problem getting these people the president wants to sell the gate to to begin to even understand the level of technology behind the gates operation in order to allow them to use it properly
7385681 an exhibition that featured archaeological treasures from one of the greatest empires in history
7385682 we finished stronger in the last 15 minutes which i was really happy about
7385683 when you defend all game it really takes it out of you but i think that type of solid defence would force a lot of other teams to make mistakes
7385684 wairarapa college played well and were very competitive they were definitely the second best team in the competition
7385685 i went and questioned the ref just to make sure
7385686 i was going for the try and i was trying to protect my head as well there was a wall there
7385687 if lote hadnt touched it i dont think it would have been a try anyway
7385688 we were robbed but thats footie we had defended well in that first stanza of the second half
7385689 they were saying he batted the ball out and that was probably accurate
7385690 they were also saying if he raikabula hadnt been there atiga would have scored but he landed on the dead ball line so had he caught the ball he wouldnt have scored it
7385691 in my opinion it has to be certain and there was an element of doubt there that was an important call
7385692 the main driver is the financials cmc markets senior dealer dominic vaughan said
7385693 were also seeing the resources sector holding up despite a mixed bag of metal prices overnight
7385694 at this stage the market looks like it may remain relatively well bid by the end of the day but it wouldnt surprise me if we did see some profit taking later on
7385695 albeit a moderated safe one with high brand fits now just needs an investor to fund the technology license customisation of self service advertising infrastructure and
7385696 the dope city girls look fucking awesome but theyll never beat those fast french bitches
7385697 theyre going to have to hit them hard and often but it is hard to hit what you cant see
7385698 it isnt just a privacy issue it is a trespassing issue with their own photos as evidence
7385699 they really went off the track to get to our address
7385700 nothing you do ever goes away and nothing you do ever escapes notice
7385701 i deeply appreciate all that youve done here and i am overwhelmed by the amount of care and precision that has gone into the planning and execution of this curriculum but i do have one question could you tell me what is the overarching purpose you are trying to achieve here in other words what kind of child are you trying to produce and why
7385702 i dont know no one has ever asked me that question
7385703 i respect and appreciate your being so open and honest but frankly your reply terrifies me

7385710 thats why hes the best at what hes doing throwing that cutter in to lefties throwing that backdoor cutter to lefties and throwing that fastball in to right handers he dont miss
7385711 hoy me parece que el partido con todo respeto por jaguares por todo el equipo y toda la instituci n este partido lo perdi el am rica
7385712 yo dir a que hemos hecho el mejor primer tiempo desde que estamos con mucho ritmo mucha determinaci n mucho juego
7385713 hemos cometido algunos errores en el segundo tiempo y seguramente no es lo que queremos y no es lo que hemos trabajado
7385714 me parece que fuimos muy ingenuos en el segundo tiempo me parece que el equipo no est como para perder puntos ni para dar confianza ni ventaja hoy perdimos una gran oportunidad de ponernos ah arriba con los puntos
7385715 no es el arranque que quer amos much simo al contrario porque es la primera vez que me pasa desde que dirijo y siempre he dirigido los equipos grandes y nos voy a cambiar mi mentalidad ni mi forma de ser ni forma de pensar este es un mensaje que le quiero mandar a la gente que nosotros vamos a intentar jugar de esta manera como en el primer tiempo
7385716 las cosas hay que construirlas no se construye tan tranquilamente como piensan ustedes se construyen se eligen los jugadores hay un mercado hay que trabajarlos hay que programarlos y me parece que nosotros fuimos muy claros en el proyecto
7385717 nothing like putting yourself out of your comfort zone in front of a bunch of people
7385718 la verdad estoy contento porque ten a muchas ganas de jugar pero aqu cooperamos todos y cada uno de los que iniciamos y los que estuvieron fuera pusieron su granito de arena para este triunfo
7385719 hubo dos cosas importantes que el equipo fue contundente y que mostramos que no nos desesperamos aunque ellos tuvieran buena posesi n de pelota ahora a descansar porque esta semana que viene va a ser muy importante para nosotros
7385720 por suerte otra vez me voy muy contento de este estadio ya no me quedan muchos a os para seguir jugando as que estoy muy agradecido y ahora tenemos que estar acertados contra pachuca el mi rcoles porque como perdieron van a salir con todo
7385721 pero a poquito que vaya ganando eso volver a ser el que era
7385722 gracias al bar a estuve all porque si ellos hubiesen querido el club contaba con una resoluci n favorable del tas tendr a que haber vuelto para ac despu s de todo lo que pas poder volver con la medalla es m s lindo todav a
7385723 ya esto ac con la medalla y ahora a pensar en todo lo que viene estoy muy motivado tambi n cuando estaba en la pretemporada por el grupo que tenemos por los jugadores nuevos que vinieron y por la ilusi n que hay
7385724 obviamente hac a mucho que no jugaba y a n no tiene ritmo de partido pero a poquito que vaya ganando eso volver a ser el que era
7385725 ahora tenemos que mirar hacia adelante y mejorar el jueves en el partido contra el gyor
7385726 l gicamente nos sentimos muy decepcionados despu s de esta derrota tuvimos un partido dif cil porque el leverkusen dispuso de un buen equipo y jug muy bien en general nos falt movimiento y por eso hemos ido por detr s en la posesi n del bal n
7385727 leverkusen se present muy fuerte mientras que a nosotros nos falt agresividad y no supimos aprovechar nuestras posibilidades al cien por ciento creo que el rival se llev una merecida victoria
7385728 estamos esperando a que se diga cuando viaja el jugador y yo creo que ma ana por la ma ana ya se dar el anuncio oficial por parte del betis pero ya pr cticamente est atado ya exclusivamente nery jugar con el betis
7385729 ma ana har a el reconocimiento m dico que se tiene que hacer la revisi n de contrato esa la hemos hecho y solamente es el sistema de transfer y bueno si no es ma ana pasado nery tiene que estar ac
7385730 la opci n del betis es buen sima y siempre hemos pensado que las decisiones tiene que tomarse por el tema deportivo y no el econ mico tienes que pensar en donde puede estar mejor el jugador ahora donde puede llegar a tener m s confianza donde va a tener otra vez una plataforma no siempre el mejor equipo es la mejor plataforma para los jugadores tambi n esto se analiz y la opci n del tema del betis es important sima para nery porque va a ser un jugador importante aqu y eso le va a servir para agarrar confianza y llegar de la mejor forma de cara al mundial
7385731 es alguien a quien han estado siguiendo much simo la gente del betis y obviamente ellos se quieren quedar a final de a o con el jugador lo que pasa es que de momento por la situaci n que ten a con el pr stamo del manchester city por la situaci n que ten a con el shakhtar se tuvo que tomar esta decisi n
7385732 este es un resultado negativo para nosotros la verdad que nos cuesta mucho trabajo venir a puebla y hacer nuestro futbol no tuvimos la tranquilidad de llegar al arco rival y atr s cometimos dos errores que no nos perdonaron
7385733 no pudimos generar llegada hasta los ltimos momentos del partido pero independientemente de eso nos falt convicci n y determinaci n y ahora tenemos la oportunidad de revancha muy pronto
7385734 luchamos hasta el final como siempre nuestros jugadores dejaron todo en el campo y no pudimos superar a una defensiva muy ordenada y muy poblada por lo que tenemos que llegar m s acompa ados al rea
7385735 esa es labor de ustedes los periodistas yo no puedo hacer un juicio p blico individual de alg n jugador lo que s es que tenemos que mejorar mucho para poder ganar a indios porque ayer jugaron bien contra toluca
7385736 ya nos enganchamos y vamos caminando con la misma idea
7385737 j venes buenas tardes nosotros como diego torres vamos andando no somos ni los mejores ni los peores les present a dos jugadores de reci n ingreso que tienen la franja tatuada y les van a decir c mo ganamos no yo
7385738 estamos contentos porque el equipo mostr malicia actitud y tener la paciencia adecuada para encontrar los espacios y generar el gol cuando en la semana se trabajan bien esas ideas se refleja en los partidos
7385739 fue un partido de choque en mediacancha porque morelia es un equipo muy ordenado pero afortunadamente hicimos las dos que tuvimos y no recibimos gol con esto demostramos que ya nos enganchamos y vamos caminando por la misma idea
7385740 oscar tiene mucha experiencia pero aqu en el puebla tenemos dos excelentes porteros lo bueno es que la mayor a del plantel poco a poco se est metiendo a la m stica del equipo y lo que nosotros queremos es ser un combinado ganador que califique muchos podr n decir que estamos locos pero para eso estamos luchando cada partido

7385772 tying the game really gave us a big boost we played much better from that point on opening the season with santa clara and california has been a big test but that goal showed us that we can compete and gave us a lot of confidence
7385773 what i am pleased about is how much of a better team we are today versus last thursday
7385774 we took giant steps forward this weekend but we need to keep taking giant steps forward we have probably just played the two toughest teams we will face all season now is the time for us to get a lot better and to keep improving as a team
7385775 we got fatigued in the second half but gutted our way through it and our mentality is starting to build into what we want it to be
7385776 as a team the athletes are coming together they are a close knit group and have a created a family atmosphere which is critical i think that is something that has been lacking in the past it is something that is a big focus for us in womens athletics the closer the team is the more you are going to battle for the person next to you a family culture builds into a championship mentality and that is what we are doing
7385777 both myself and the team thought that we had a good chance to win this race in the early running we had to make a pit stop because of a loosening wheel nut but since we were running on a 4 pit stop strategy i kept driving for 62 laps that was tough laughs but it was important that i was able to do that also when i was battling with no 100 we had plenty of fuel and were able to make our pit stop one lap later than theirs that is a big part of the reason why we won this is a victory won by the drivers the team and everyone together i hope that now we will be able to compete for the title in the last race of the season
7385778 i am really happy with todays race when we were having problems in the early going i never thought that we would be able to win but tsugio ran a perfect race by the time i started my last leg i was confident that we could win i have been on the winning team three times here at the pokka 1000km but since it has become a super gt there are a lot of strong rivals and it is much harder to win now than it was before whats why im especially happy with todays win
7385779 before the race there was the strategic possibility of intentionally not going for a top place this time because the handicap weights we would have to carry for the next race but as long as we are going to compete i thought we should try to win during the race i told the team over the radio that i had a strategy to win the team responded and we were able to win on every lap i could see the nissan flags that the fans were waving and that encouraged me a lot

7385831 mama can you tell me again the story about when i was born
7385832 it was the revolution and i was a nurse in the volunteer army your father and i joined because we believed in the cause and all of our friends joined too it was what everyone did then our passion for a different world gave us such courage
7385833 we were but i was so happy because i knew i was already having you
7385834 and fortunately the fighting was light when i went into labor with you and i had medical people around me to make sure everything was smooth i was lucky for sure when i went unconscious during your delivery
7385835 but you saw me when you woke up what did i look like
7385836 it was awful when i woke up you were gone the fighting started up again and your father and his brother pedro fled to take you and the other children to the place where pedros wife camilla was in safe hiding she and i were pregnant at the same time me with you and she with your cousin miguel it was wonderful because we became like sisters and when she died shortly after that in the fighting i was devastated
7385837 you and i were separated for three months they were the longest three months of my life and when i finally saw you i wept tears of joy and relief for days
7385838 i remember his face as i was losing consciousness and never saw him again the reports we got were that he was with a group fighting in the north who were never heard from again
7385839 why of course you have it hasnt been easy to raise you alone but i have always been proud to be your mother
7385840 you wish i were proud of you how could you say that
7385841 last week when i was on my way home from school for your birthday a man came from across the street and started to walk with me he said his name was pedro
7385842 he told me the story of how i was born
7385843 he knew everything you know the part about how you always wanted a girl he knew that he knew everything about you he told me about how he and my father fought together and how one day when everyone in their group was killed he saved my fathers life he told me that when camilla had her child she was a girl and that she and pedro were heart broken because they wanted a boy who could carry on in his fathers footsteps for the revolution
7385844 they knew you always wanted a girl and that you never saw the child you had and so he and my father agreed to give your son miguel to pedro and return me to you
7385845 in politics there are people who will tell you things that arent on their mind
7385846 we as a government are committed to taking tough decisions and tough action for the economys long term interest and also for the environments long term interest
7385847 part of that is acting responsibly on climate change and part of that in turn means acting through a pollution reduction scheme
7385848 id say to them as i say to other business that this will not come cost free because if you roll the clock ahead 10 20 years 30 years overall across australia what people are saying is this we have wasted enough time its time to act
7385849 if we fail to act the economic cost to australia will be huge
7385850 philosophical questions about mean variance analyses and optimizations is it important for an investor in the accumulation phase to control portfolio variance assuming this is a buy and hold investor not prone to behavioral panics obviously portfolio variance is important in the withdrawal phase but i was hoping to get some feedback on the utility of minimizing variance in the accumulation phase
7385851 im guessing that if you used data intervals of more than one month youd have less of a need to make the potentially controversial decision to constrain the optimization to be sure a larger sample size does allow you to predict return and risk within a narrower confidence interval but its all past data anyway so its not like youre going to be 99 confident that the future is going to resemble the past even with the larger sample

7385919 el mundo humano y deshumanizado que surge de estas p ginas es como un bestiario donde las personas se pueden mimetizar con un gato o un perro o una planta cuando el olor de la muerte est en el aire y hay lugares donde el silencio duele y los espacios de la rutina nos visten de anonimato el hombre extra o el pordiosero el loquito el espantap jaros el preso el internado el viejo abandonado el solitario acechado por las sombras el que responde a un n mero m s que a su nombre verdadero esas personas diferentes que provocan susto y cuya cercan a incomoda a los normales es el protagonista que se potencia en un colectivo al revisar el conjunto del libro la marginalidad como la procesi n va por dentro hay una coherencia en este libro que representa bien la mirada de juan mihovilovich se potencian los cuentos individuales configurando una sola obra que responde a una voz distintiva que enorgullece a nuestra generaci n tambi n celebro la poeticidad en la paradoja del t tulo

7385921 they make less than 50 000 theyre catholics they live in small towns and rural america the places that bill clinton spent all his time campaigning and oh by the way they love bill clinton
7385922 are sitting out there loving the clintons not liking barack obama what has to happen between now and november to get that critical 11 percent to move into barack obamas column
7385923 the clintons have to make the case i know this guy hes ready i like him he can lead
7385924 its the bill clinton question i think that a lot of people are going to watch
7385925 the only similarity between the two stories is a cross in the dirt but it is hardly an unlikely coincidence that there were practicing christians in both russia and vietnam or that in the prisons of those two communist countries the only crosses to be found were etched in the dirt as easily disappeared as the christians who drew them

7385933 the group consultation with its lenders has concluded that no proposal received to date provides acceptable outcome which is in the best interests of all relevant stakeholders it said
7385934 the group believes that in particular given current difficult capital market conditions an acceptable proposal capable of being implemented by 15 december 2008 is unlikely to be forthcoming
7385935 in the absence of a recapitalisation solution in the short term the groups objective therefore is to obtain longer term debt extensions from the lender groups beyond 15 december 2008 to provide a more stabilised environment for the recapitalisation process to be pursued over a longer time frame it said
7385936 the group has commenced discussions with the lender groups on possible terms for longer term debt extension and stabilisation of the group
7385937 it is likely that those terms would include a requirement for the conversion of a portion of debt into some form of hybrid security
7385938 this may impact the value of the groups existing ordinary equity
7385939 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7385940 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the type of spit for the task at hand
7385941 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7385942 if it was proved they cheated we would have a right to be upset
7385943 it is something that potentially would be in breach of our code of conduct
7385944 if appropriate it would be looked into it depends on the evidence and circumstances

7385947 that such a large amount of fish is used for the pet food industry is real eye opener
7385948 what is also interesting is that in australia pet cats are eating an estimated 13 7 kilograms of fish a year which far exceeds the australian average human per capita fish and seafood consumption of around 11 kilograms
7385949 our pets seem to be eating better than their owners
7385950 while much of the criticism has been on the grounds that forage fish could be better used for human consumption directly particularly amongst the poorer nations of the world rather than in the production of food for farmed fish little attention has been paid to the amount of forage fish used by the pet food industry
7385951 these gourmet pet foods contain a significant amount of fish that may be suitable for direct human consumption

7386015 we were threatened not to protest at this event i think that needs to be said we were made to sign a document not to protest for the betterment of taekwondo it was a very big thing there was a table you went up to the table and you signed the document you signed it in front of the secretary general of the wtf and you gave him the document
7386016 i think after the auckland game we talked about how our lineout had been going for the past 12 months prior rather than that one game
7386017 you dont become a bad lineout overnight or a good lineout over night
7386018 we talked about what wed done well in the first five or six games before that auckland test and went back to what we saw as our strengths and that worked for us
7386019 to lose vicks pretty early on we did a lot of work on our lineout throughout the week obviously with him running the show and for those guys to come in and hold it together for the rest of the game was full credit to jimmy horwill and to mummy as well when he came on

7386035 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7386036 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7386037 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7386038 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7386039 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7386040 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7386041 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure
7386042 we need somebody who talks tough whos going to act smart and be tough thats how were going to look after the safety of the american people
7386043 i dont think hes ready to be president and when youre commander in chief you shouldnt be having to select a mentor to help you with that role
7386044 hari ini bentuk kerajaan esok harga minyak turun tapi harga barang tak boleh turun ke enche
7386045 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7386046 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7386047 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7386048 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7386049 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily

7386053 the market is following on from wall street on friday night and reporting season coming in near enough to expectations macquarie private wealth divisional director martin lakos said
7386054 its pretty much in line with consensus but there are always positive and negative surprises during reporting season and were getting our fair share
7386055 were more than half way through now and the market is starting to refocus on the outlook statements from the companies and clearly the next big thing is when and if interest rates are cut
7386056 there werent many models where you could go to do this i did it intuitively i have four people in the office and five people at the house and i dont even have a job why it takes that many people to sustain me is hard to explain they have been with me for a long time which makes things run smoothly because they know my habits and predilections

7386068 he was like a cheshire cat his countenance without emotion
7386069 there is no known photo of lansky and batista together or any documents signed jointly by them their partnership seems to have existed on a near mystical plane with each man knowing intuitively what the other required to manipulate the levers of power and create opportunities for personal remuneration
7386070 lansky age forty four was trim and tanned as usual his 5 foot 4 inch stature had earned him the nickname little man it was meant ironically in his chosen profession as an underworld entrepreneur who specialized in gambling lansky was anything but little
7386071 when batista heard this news smith detected a slight irregularity in his breathing as if the cuban dictator had been kicked in the testicles
7386072 i want to live in john mccains world those were the days when men were men when the differences between good and evil were clear when they knew where they stood on every issue when life was less complicated where there was an air of insouciance no matter how difficult the issues
7386073 i want to live in a world where gen david petraeus and meg whitman former chief executive of ebay are the wisest people i know where offshore drilling will help easy our energy crisis i want to live in a world where i was absolutely certain that life begins at conception where the only thing to do with evil is defeat it

7386077 youve got the dumbkopf military clown mccain hes too old
7386078 obama is real hard for an individual to vote for
7386079 why experience and race i dont want to sugarcoat it
7386080 there was a lot to be said for both of them obama has the ability to inspire which is something i think this nation truly needs but hillary is a known quantity
7386081 the last couple presidential races weve had these huge issues that have drawn out people
7386082 weve got a lot of people moving in who are commuting to the cities and tend to be a little more conservative voters
7386083 we walked into the room and you could just feel the energy
7386084 every since then i was like this guys got something special
7386085 its shocking but ive been surprised at the number of people ive encountered around here who will say im not ready to vote for a black person
7386086 i like his position on national security primarily and the fact that hes pro life
7386087 i think hes an inexperienced guy trying to fill a position that hes really not qualified for
7386088 the fact that his father was a muslim and he was raised muslim in his early childhood years that plays a factor
7386089 any president i vote for has to be a christian i dont think its a prejudice so much its just that i think our values are different
7386090 obama i think still fluctuates because hes on a learning curve
7386091 but once youre in it you have to deal with the cards that you are dealt and i think mccains probably the best one to bring it to a reasonable ending
7386092 i think they should both be on the ticket i think wed have the best of both worlds
7386093 if he doesnt get in that will be the only reason
7386094 hes just a new and a different face and people are sort of swooning
7386095 there is no excuse for party elites who believe they have more power than the grassroots
7386096 if we allow that to continue our freedoms are taken away from us and we are ruled by a group of elitists
7386097 i didnt know exactly where he stood on some of the value issues
7386098 the way he answered those questions it showed a depth of character to me that i hadnt realized before
7386099 he also answered them very straight forward no hesitation as to what he believed
7386100 i think he is very intelligent a very moving speaker
7386101 i think he believes in socialism and wants to move the country to become a socialist country
7386102 puts the j into kj smart and a lot of the smart too
7386103 modern criminal power has surpassed the government attempts to contain it international organized crime is too big nobody knows how to deal with it perhaps it cant be dealt with as long as the world is divided into nearly 200 sovereign states while the big crime syndicates simply go where the money is sovereign states cannot do anything simply if they go down to dismal defeat in the war against crime it will be largely because they are hampered by all the baggage of statecraft patriotism politics accountable governments human rights legal strictures international conventions bureaucracy diplomacy whereas the big criminal syndicates have no national allegiances no laws of their own no frontiers

7386128 we intend to have hundreds of bikes available in the weeks leading up to the rnc and carry the energy over for a community bike shop after the rnc is dead and gone from this land
7386129 as a health benefits company focused on sustainability it works for us for a lot of different reasons
7386130 so people can make connections to our trails and streets with bike lanes
7386131 the bigger chunk is trying to make a real bike share happen in minneapolis by next may
7386132 in order to have things be anything beyond recreational well have to have an advanced network
7386133 bringing those 1 000 bikes will capture the imagination of the city
7386134 whether those bikes end up being part of the system is an open question
7386135 will have a lot of value to a lot of people
7386136 theres potential for hundreds of bikers throughout city to be using something like this
7386137 the whole idea is for people to use bikes for short trips for utilitarian purposes
7386138 by now all of them have disappeared and thats what happened in every city
7386139 at the same time paris did that they made infrastructure improvements they had policy changes they basically opened up many corridors
7386140 the whole strategy is to favor pedestrian and bicycle transport so you give bicycles and pedestrian advantages over motorists
7386141 you give them shortcuts on a one way street you allow two way for bicycles you provide as much space as you can
7386142 where transportation planners acknowledge that bicycling is a social activity so they want to have bike lanes wide enough to accommodate bicycles two abreast with room for third to pass
7386143 i think somebody will have to say yeah this has become a priority were going to make downtown as bicycle friendly as possible
7386144 whats being neglected in my mind is the concept of routine accommodation
7386145 whenever a street is being improved they should automatically re stripe it to include a bike lane
7386146 we are but its not because we dont share the same enthusiasm minneapolis does our issue is that st paul is designed differently than minneapolis we dont have a chain of lakes infrastructure that can be the hub of bike routes to spoke out from its more complicated in st paul
7386147 you need a full time bike coordinator to take on projects like this

7386191 running against john mccains policies in 2008 is like running against bourbon at a temperance convention
7386192 sometimes your friends are dead wrong and on the big issues this november john mccain is as dead wrong as you can be joe biden thinks the war in iraq has been a huge mistake while john mccain would do it all over again
7386193 to his credit john repudiates some of the bush administrations approach to the world
7386194 he recognizes that the power of our example is as important as the example of our power that allies we respect not disdain can advance our interests he is especially eloquent about his abhorrence for war as john is uniquely placed to be
7386195 john mccain and joe biden said send more troops we need more troops
7386196 was going to start to listen to john mccain instead of the secretary of defense because they have totally different no i shouldnt say totally many have very different views of how to proceed
7386197 i believe that there is no separation between george bush and john mccain when it comes to our middle east policy and i think their policy has failed
7386198 i dont care what john mccain says he is not going to push that agenda hard
7386199 would not be happening without leadership from both parties over the years senator mccain joined senator lieberman in introducing the first senate cap and trade legislation
7386200 i believe if neither he nor i were senators and i picked up a phone and called him and said i need you to show up at such and such a place i cant tell you why he would be there
7386201 would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
7386202 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7386203 let he who is without sin cast the first stone

7386211 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7386212 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of 10 tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games which includes a final propaganda push to legitimize chinas rule in tibet with tibetans singing and dancing along with other so called ethnic minorities

7386343 it is a difficult situation for opec on one hand they are asked to produce more on the other one washington and brussels are telling the cartel we are betting on biofuels and we dont want to rely on you opec
7386344 you dont get the incremental oil and you dont get the ethanol

7386346 they keep moving the dates up they keep moving the dates further and further up and it obviously encroaches or endangers the state of new hampshire now i will promise you i will do everything in my power and i say this because of my reverence for the system everything in my power to make sure that new hampshire maintains its first in the nation status
7386347 as you know every state is literally moving their primary date up up up we must preserve new hampshires first in the nation status for the good of the nation for the good of the nation not necessarily just because of the good of the state of new hampshire
7386348 the state of new hampshire as usual is in danger of losing its first in the nation status i want to promise you that i will do everything in my power to make sure that that status is maintained new hampshire deserves it
7386349 there was a lot of institutional selling in sterling mr waterer said
7386350 on the back of that we saw some other currencies fall such as the euro and the australian dollar

7386353 gold fell on the stronger us dollar and commodity currencies like the aussie have fallen on the back of that

7386361 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts
7386362 the company aims to hold workers pay to below the rate of inflation effectively cutting its wages bill by almost 15 per cent over four years
7386363 for the average technician this would amount to a cut in real wages over time of 7300 a year
7386364 telstra is a prime example of big employers who are behaving badly towards their staff and thumbing their nose at the rudd governments cooperative industrial relations policy
7386365 we expect to see new laws introduced into the parliament very soon to scrap all of work choices and replace it with a fair and balanced industrial relations system
7386366 we have taken the extra step of talking to wholesale employees about whats important to them and that will be reflected in any proposed agreement

7386384 i knew the foreigner was most likely of the guild my sources tell me llyr is an ambitious and unscrupulous mid ranker who i imagine is involved in your plot and lord lochshire is as likely a target as any i also knew that roy was to ride today to kill men the way he had prepared his weapons before he left now i will ride with you to help kill these men

7386410 why must we fight and kill to push our agenda
7386411 why do you scoff when you see a peace sign
7386412 why do you roll your eyes when you speak to someone who cant speak perfect english isnt this the exact opposite of the values you taught me
7386413 they will take over this country and your generation will find out what a damn mistake you made you have to live with your decision
7386414 i may be naive in your eyes i may be unrealistic in your eyes but im more than happy being filled with naivety and love for my fellow man than being filled with pessimism and hate for all of those who disagree with me
7386415 we have a situation where an enormous amount of time is spent each sitting day by ministerial staff and department employees including senior public servants preparing answers to questions for ministers in both houses many of whom will never be asked any questions he said in a statement
7386416 if you cannot answer a questions in two minutes you probably cannot answer it at all he said
7386417 i nephi having been highly favored of the lord in all my days yea having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of god
7386418 great and marvelous are thy works o lord god almighty
7386419 but behold i nephi will show unto you that the tender mercies of the lord are over all those whom he hath chosen because of their faith to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance
7386420 the spirit of the gospel is optimistic it trusts in god and looks on the bright side of things the opposite or pessimistic spirit drags men down and away from god looks on the dark side murmurs complains and is slow to yield obedience
7386421 even in the golden age of civilization someone undoubtedly grumbled that everything looked too yellow
7386422 theres never really been a tie in to the candidates home state unless its a swing state
7386423 they are dealing with similar issues but i also want to hear from them to get some possible solutions
7386424 the male is described as being approximately 25 years of age chubby build wearing a dark shirt blue jeans and white cap
7386425 you have three cities in the state that have 40 of the states affordable housing provide for most of the populations that have mental health and substance abuse needs and basically is here for everybody whether youre a graduate student at yale or frankly whether youre someone with long term mental health and substance abuse problems
7386426 thats the role that the cities in our state provide
7386427 we will be a place for everybody thats what weve chosen to be
7386428 we dont pass zoning that keep people out we dont refuse facilities be they group homes mental health facilities substance abuse we have 24 registered sex offenders living in the city of new haven right now and a parole and probation population of 5 000
7386429 hi how is everybody doing today i am tommy and this is sheri
7386430 we have got about 12 to 14 properties we are going to see today we are going to try to keep moving very quickly
7386431 i had no idea that in such a nice location i could get a house for a price that is half of what it was just three years back
7386432 a lot of these foreclosures dont even have signs up saying that they are foreclosures and they are gone in a day
7386433 so its difficult to find them and when we do its hard to work with the banks to get our contracts approved so we decided that if it was that hard for us to do how hard it was for everybody else to do it
7386434 they make it very organized and its kind of fun you know to go on the buses to see all the properties
7386435 it does save me a lot of time instead of actually contacting all the agents to go through these properties
7386436 if you put it into a light where you look at this house and you say somebody used to live there and they lost their home and they lost everything its really hard
7386437 but we want to make it an enjoyable experience and fun and a great opportunity for new people to have a home themselves that maybe couldnt afford a home three years ago
7386438 yes there is a sad story involved if you are to see a foreclosed house but if you really look at it from an investment perspective you know its like any other business
7386439 apparently australia new zealand and england have also unofficially conveyed to the icc they wouldnt be sending their teams we now want a weeks delay in the final decision as the government says it will get involved and use diplomatic channels to convince the four countries
7386440 sports minister najmuddin khan and top officials will meet ambassadors of the four countries and try to convince them that the government is committed to providing the highest level of security for participating teams
7386441 a number of options were discussed in case champions trophy is to be shifted from pakistan or postponed one of them is that pakistan will remain hosts and in conjunction with the icc and organisers in abu dhabi sharjah and dubai will hold the event there
7386442 this option is viable as the three emirates states are also interested in such a proposal and they have facilities to host an international event if not immediately but in a few months time plus the biggest thing is there are no security issues or threats in these places
7386443 this is an extremely difficult time for me and my family i would like to thank all those who have offered their love and support
7386444 i will be making no further comment at this time and would request that the privacy of our family is respected
7386445 t o date what has been announced publicly doesnt appear in reality to be happening
7386446 we would of course welcome that the areas are genuinely used
7386447 quite happy to hear that many of the 77 cases have been resolved through dialogue and communication
7386448 for those who want to protest as long as their problems get solved its good enough

7386453 gautam gambhir is fit to play and we are hoping he fires at the top on sunday
7386454 zaheer is having a niggle in his legs but he will be fit for the match
7386455 we are discussing various things like newcomers in the team and the way they have played it augurs well for indian cricket these young lads like virat kohli and badrinath are able to deliver
7386456 we saw there is a bit of grass in the wicket but we do not know whether it will stay on we will have a look at the wicket and decide on the combination before the match starts
7386457 we are hoping for the best while getting prepared for the worst
7386458 it would be highly disappointing if the champions trophy is not held here because we have spent so much time money and energy in ensuring its successful hosting cricket fans in pakistan who were deprived of top quality action because of australias decision against visiting pakistan earlier this year for a full test and odi series will once again suffer if the champions trophy is taken away from here
7386459 we fear a negative call from the icc though efforts are still on to somehow convince all competing teams to play in pakistan
7386460 an important linkage between the government and those involved in sports
7386461 behind this contradictory and almost laughable tongue twister lies an important and growing global trend that deserves more scrutiny governments funding and controlling nongovernmental organizations ngos often stealthily
7386462 the police have filed a criminal case against him and we want the money to be recovered since we cant file the civil suit after february 2009 as it will become time barred then we want to do so soon and recover rs 47 77 crore that he owes the bcci
7386463 whosoever could make two ears of corn or two blades of grass to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before would deserve better of mankind
7386464 an undeniable inculpatory admission of the harvesting of falun gong practitioner prisoners for profit
7386465 caller what you used before were they from detention centers or prisons
7386466 c oh prisons and it was from healthy falun gong practitioners the healthy falun gong right
7386467 lg right right right we would choose the good ones because we will assure the quality of our operations
7386468 i told her the caller i was not involved in the surgical operations and had no idea where the organs come from i told her i could not answer her questions she then asked me whether these organs come from prisons i replied no to her in clear cut terms
7386469 so here we have on our recording an admission from a doctor that he and his colleagues used to go to a prison to select falun gong practitioners for their organs he does not just say that someone else did this he says that he and his colleagues used to do this themselves moreover we have a further admission that the voice we have on our recording is the voice of the very person our recording says he is
7386470 it has the sanction of the government of china the admission is accordingly one which is sanctioned and approved by the government of china and can not credibly be denied by the government
7386471 we are prepared for this and we are expecting a formal announcement at the teleconference
7386472 terrorism is a problem all over the world it is not just limited to pakistan and keeping this in mind we have made the best possible security arrangements for the champions trophy in consultation with the icc security people so how can countries now say they cant come to pakistan
7386473 we are supporting pakistan the event must be in pakistan i dont think we will change our stance at the moment i dont think the indian board will change its view in the present circumstances
7386474 i don t think it will be divided i think there will be a solution on this

7386476 the biological mechanism for how these disinfection by products may cause defects are still unknown
7386477 however our findings dont just add to the evidence that water chlorination may cause birth defects but suggest that exposure to chlorination by products may be responsible for some specific and common defects
7386478 while the benefits of water chlorination are quite evident more research needs to be carried out to determine these side effects
7386479 little evidence between thm concentrations in drinking water and risk of congenital defects and consequently tap water is safe for expectant mothers

7386574 the independent assessor of the settlement facility dow corning trust sf dct reviewed the liabilities and assets of the facility as of the end of the second quarter of 2007 and estimated that the facility would remain solvent under each of a range of liability and asset assumptions tested until patterns of filing and claims acceptance become more certain use of the current estimates for the purpose of determining whether premium payments can be made is premature

7386590 there are plenty of hacked company databases for sale online but the sheer volume and quality of the information thats been stolen in the best western raid makes this particularly rare in the wrong hands theres enough data there to spark a major european crime wave
7386591 best western took immediate action to disable the compromised log in
7386592 we are currently in the process of working with our credit card
7386593 we continue to investigate the root cause of the issue including but
7386594 we encourage guests with concerns to contact their local best western
7386595 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7386596 we dont have any illusions about the challenges we face in getting our message out but you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7386597 there should be a balance and we want to make sure were available to tell the other side of the story
7386598 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now
7386599 its a spirit that says we are looking for different
7386600 the citizens of the united states of america have the ultimate responsibility to elect the
7386601 when i started polling nevada that was a pretty solidly conservative county the fact that it is tied now means it is a true swing county
7386602 i dont expect tibet to be free once the olympics end
7386603 but were trying to take the spotlight away from chinas growth and put it on the abuses of their occupation
7386604 it takes more than just economic might to be a world leader justice has to be part of that
7386605 i believed that as human beings the chinese people if they knew what was really going on in tibet they would be outraged by that as well
7386606 but the more i thought about it this is something i felt i had to do i realized that i have the ability to go and to go speak out and in a way that a lot of tibetans are not able to
7386607 we were tourists through and through they would have gotten really bored if they followed us
7386608 its hard not to be nervous and scared when you see 12 paramilitary police in full camouflage sprinting towards you across the parking lot
7386609 the fact that they couldnt even stand to tolerate a foreigner speaking openly in the press makes it even more poignant the lack of tibetan voices
7386610 his holiness the dalai lama must be invited to tibet the political prisoners including his serenity panchen lama must be released immediately
7386611 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
7386612 i say clearly on behalf of the ioc that we would not want to see that happen again
7386613 placing sport at the service of mankind and leveraging olympic values to promote better understanding between people nations and religions stands at the core of our mission
7386614 dont expect the olympic games to do something political leaders cant do
7386615 i know him very well and i know he has been on the front lines of the fight for social and economic justice his entire time in public service
7386616 i have a responsibility i do not own my vote i have to represent the voters who sent me
7386617 i was sent to denver to vote for clinton i would be letting my voters down if i voted for anyone else
7386618 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7386619 hed work as hard as he could and harder than anybody else and that would either see it through or not he put his whole campaign on his shoulder
7386620 it was a streak of good fortune that he ran out of money and went up there and was himself thats what people love that he is himself not some sort of synthetic character trying to figure out who he is
7386621 the middle seat on southwest gave me a lot more opportunity to interact with voters
7386622 im not complaining still have town hall meetings still able to do 95 percent of what i did before
7386623 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7386624 and he has not demonstrated that he accepts the clintons and the clinton wing of the party
7386625 this is the sort of story cooked up just to feed cable producers not an issue
7386626 that puts him in a terrible bind because you cant give a ringing endorsement when youre talking about foreign policy
7386627 obviously the hard thing to talk about with obama is commander in chief of all his many talents
7386628 you dont rah rah about commander in chief you rah rah about hope and change and a new party and all that so no matter what he does somebody will find fault with it
7386629 i think hes got a high bar because he needs to show enthusiasm and the press will be looking for any stray remark as a sign that he doesnt fully support
7386630 elaborate upon his stated intention to reduce the number of abortions by providing alternative programs
7386631 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed
7386632 but if we have increased the number of chairs around the table then weve succeeded
7386633 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
7386634 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies
7386635 an arms race that few can even hope to compete in much less win
7386636 embracing open source development crowd sourcing content targeting different platforms such as the web or mobile phones all of these are valid
7386637 i will die alone upside down in a pub toilet
7386638 omgod why has no one thought of such a thing yet
7386639 i will die alone upside down in a pub toilet
7386640 most earbuds are designed for specific left and right ear use they tend to be mirror images of each other so the sound is better channelled into the ear canal apart from that it wouldnt matter which way round you have them unless 1 for classical music the orchestra layout has the first violins on the left etc so it would not sound right the other way round and 2 for films etc the stereo should logically place the sounds where the image appears on the screen
7386641 you ask about the headphones on the iphone i cant see it making a difference if you are on a call but if you are watching a movie on the iphones screen and someone speaks from off screen on the right and the right earbud is in your left ear you hear it on the left and everyone on screen looks to the right side of the screen you will experience a moment or more of cognitive incongruity i would think that might drive me mad by the end of the movie kids just put it in the right ear grin
7386642 since you hate music im sure you dont care if you hear footsteps run from left to right instead of right to left in pink floyds
7386643 isnt that an oxymoron theres no such thing as an honest mechanic
7386644 i will die alone upside down in a pub toilet
7386645 it was a little bit of a shame to fight with him in the pit lane because he would have had to have let me pass we came so close to the wall and i had to back off which cost me a bit of time fortunately the gap was enough
7386646 ms bynes was driving a bmw when she made an unsafe turn and another car hit her
7386647 it was determined that she was at fault but no crime was committed

7386666 the capture of abu tiba and abu othman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi network
7386667 i was up near the logging trails up in vancouver a year ago and i was in the middle of the river one mate was nearly a quarter of a mile down the river so im tying this fly and i hear this thing come crashing through the trees right in front of me
7386668 i couldnt do anything so i went into a ball i thought if hes coming over this is it all i had was a big knife my heart was beating out of my chest i thought it was a bear but it was a deer
7386669 i just squatted in the middle of the river and the deer just swam across the river i got the camera and i got pictures of that thankfully it wasnt a bear i lived to tell the story
7386670 this crack is moving and moving closer and closer to the front its just a matter of time till a much larger piece is going to break off it is imminent
7386671 as we see this phenomenon occurring farther and farther north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern
7386672 its a signal but we dont know what it means
7386673 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
7386674 fortunately there were not too many indifferent feelings about the brand that is the last thing you want from any brand
7386675 overall people like the idea of promoting happiness and using ones time to do the things that make them happy
7386676 people remember the brand connect with the time to concept and the majority of people like the bright style and choice of vibrant colours
7386677 kites for kids is done all across nsw but dubbo is the biggest of those events
7386678 i would say we have had about 500 people here today and they have had a really good time
7386679 we got great weather and the thing about the concept is that people of all ages love to come out and fly the kite weve got young children parents and even some grandparents
7386680 we thought we might run out of kites but thankfully we have had enough for everyone
7386681 for new stores oporto prefers to use this method of recruiting
7386682 we tend to get a good turnout especially in regional areas we find face to face interviews much better than over the phone interviews or via resumes this method allows oporto the opportunity to meet the person and get a sense of their personality
7386683 we are looking for enthusiastic reliable flexible and genuinely friendly people who are as passionate as we are about serving great tasting products
7386684 the council has employed a number of strategies over recent years to ensure that the fleet operates efficiently by reducing the amount of fuel consumed purchasing modern technology and optimising load capacities
7386685 today computers come with operating programs but back then people had to write their own peter said
7386686 fortunately i became a quick learner after wading through the books it took a few months to deliver anything useful but before long the engineers were using the computer to draw plans
7386687 industry experts from around nsw came to dubbo to see what macquarie county council was doing
7386688 a year later a 12 inch floppy disc add on system was purchased at a cost of 18 000
7386689 computers were still a great interest so i purchased a small technology business in north dubbo
7386690 the business operated from various locations today it west is based in talbragar street and offers computer service and support throughout the region we also retail jaycar electronics products
7386691 its amazing how far computers have come in a relatively short period of time
7386692 technology has an enormous impact on everyday life and is a fundamental part of business and education
7386693 rapid change continues and there will be enormous strides in technology in the coming years
7386694 the introduction of co ed catholic education was big news for dubbo peter said
7386695 girls had previously been taught at the mercy nuns convent school in the grounds of st brigids church
7386696 de la salle brothers educated boys separately in george street
7386697 you dont have to be a diagnosed coeliac or a member of the support group to attend mrs prior said
7386698 all are welcome there will be a gold coin donation and a gluten free supper people are asked to rsvp on or before thursday september 4 by telephoning 6887 8353 or 0428 466 399
7386699 following a coeliac diet becomes second nature after a while and nowadays is made much easier by the extensive range of gluten free foods in local supermarkets mrs prior said
7386700 it is important to have a small bowel biopsy to formally diagnose coeliac disease before embarking on a gluten free diet unfortunately some people tend to self diagnose and put themselves through the unnecessary expense and emotional stress of following a difficult strict diet
7386701 self diagnosis is not recommended because the symptoms being experienced could be masking another condition that needs medical attention
7386702 the people standing in the election are standing for the highest office in local government
7386703 every candidate has their own propaganda through a campaign but this is a sworn statutory declaration so it is the only truly honest document voters get the chance to see before the poll i believe voters should take the time to look at the candidate information sheets before the election and see who appears to be sincere in showing the voters what they stand for
7386704 i ran for the national party at the last state election so a lot of people would be aware of where i stand
7386705 i dont see the point in not declaring that information but i am only responsible for my own campaign and it is an individual choice
7386706 in saying that the group i am leading into this election is not a national party group and we are standing in order to serve the people of dubbo at a local level
7386707 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7386708 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7386709 we are not going to parade nuns in bathing suits
7386710 but being ugly is not a requirement for becoming a nun external beauty is gift from god and we mustnt hide it
7386711 meanwhile we are enjoying the strongest inflows of new investment funds we have experienced in the past two years we are averaging 4 7m of new funds per week during the 2008 calendar year
7386712 theres nothing wrong with trying to develop wildlife tourism in australia he said
7386713 shooting is restricted to licensed commercial operators and our association wouldnt want to change that he said
7386714 an experience with native wildlife is exactly what many tourists are looking for when
7386715 this is especially the case for overseas visitors about 40 000 people go to the warrumbungle national park near coonabarabran each year and one of its main attractions is the virtual guarantee of seeing kangaroos mainly eastern greys but also swamp wallabies and red necked wallabies
7386716 sturt national park on the border of nsw queensland and south australia is a good place to see them she said
7386717 other territorial authorities throughout canterbury are monitoring this situation closely and will activate if necessary
7386718 there is an unmet need for such vaccine products and we hope our teams can crack it by working together to get it into the clinics
7386719 with significant advances made in laundry technology in recent years new laundry equipment utilises significantly less labour energy and water than older equipment
7386720 it is pleasing to report that actions over the past months are delivering improved performance which will be reflected in future trading results
7386721 got a bit exuberant about the numbers were not going to impose costs like 50 a week on motorists
7386722 you get to choose the balance and theres no way that we are going to be imposing a 50 cost on motorists i think the level of tolling that the governments talking about on puhoi a motorway extention north of auckland which is about 2 is more reasonable
7386723 if theres going to be tolling where they are paying then government should be looking at whether it can offset that by lower petrol prices
7386724 while nationals ability to issue policies only to have to issue corrections and clarifications of those policies within 24 hours is a source of amusement it is also alarming that a major political party is unwilling to be clear about its real agenda
7386725 so youre probably talking about 20 percent of the new project and relative to the rest of the roading network its sort of less than 2 or 3 percent
7386726 she tried her best to get to it to the point of actually pulling and breaking chains
7386727 they kept telling me push push push and i was pushing to the limit
7386728 there was nothing left out there that was fun a lot of fun oh my god this is awesome weve been close so often we never lost faith this is great for detroit
7386729 this is a race thats very tough unfortunately we got the bad end of the stick hopefully well turn it around next time when you lose 30 whatever points today it makes it a lot easier to come back
7386730 concerned about someone googling someones name and being able to access it later
7386731 a point that needs making is that judge harvey is no mug when it comes to the internet he has written a text book on cyber law in new zealand
7386732 on a technical level he probably knows more about the internet than any other judge in the country
7386733 he is the right age the right man and its the right time for the job before his best years are wasted marking time
7386734 my government would be more than happy if tata motors decides to set up its plant at gwalior in madhya pradesh the government would be willing to offer land and other facilities required for setting up the project
7386735 the government wouldnt lag behind in extending any such help which would bring in investments and provide jobs to the people of the state
7386736 it how churches and leaders can get it and keep it

7386740 do you think kontera is something youll be interested in using on your blog or site why or why not
7386741 if anything we predate the green movement so you could argue that the greens are actually jumping on our bandwagon back in the early seventies for example naturism was defined as a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by self respect respect for others and for the environment even before then in the 19th century naturists always stressed their eco credentials
7386742 i for one will enjoy the balmy climate that encourages nudity
7386743 so we actively support pro global warming places and companies no longer will nudists be forced into the fetish of clothes wearing it frees up everybody to go clothing free the way god intended
7386744 the scramble to cover every eventuality clotheswise is replaced by a disdain for apparel bordering on the obsessive the immediate effect of this textile trimming is that my luggage normally equal in volume to a medium sized car consists of just a small case
7386745 i had so many heroes that i wanted to be like
7386746 with sex and the citys box office success this year and rumours of a friends movie its interesting to see the public still choose two sci fi entertainment shows as their film favourites
7386747 while trekkers have had a number of big screen delights who fans are hoping that the success of the new incarnation of doctor who will see it make the jump to a cinema near them
7386748 i dunno must be something i dunno dont work better
7386749 i dunno you call they have to fix and they find something something stuck in pipe you gonna have to pay 100
7386750 with sex and the citys box office success this year and rumours of a friends movie its interesting to see the public still choose two sci fi entertainment shows as their film favourites

7386752 we cant make torchwood toys we cant market to children because its an adult show maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
7386753 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7386754 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7386755 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7386756 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7386757 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7386758 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7386759 for everyone who poured their time energy and creativity into the making of this project i give my sincerest congratulations
7386760 chinese authorities informed us last night that the eight individuals detained august 20 and 21 respectively were deported by chinese authorities
7386761 we urge china to take positive steps to address international and domestic concerns about its record on human rights and religious freedoms
7386762 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of 10 tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games
7386763 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7386764 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7386765 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7386766 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7386767 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7386768 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7386769 it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as it is great and fantastic
7386770 im not against it so long as it never gets in the way of the tv show if it got in the way of the show that would be appalling
7386771 it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as it is great and fantastic
7386772 im not against it so long as it never gets in the way of the tv show if it got in the way of the show that would be appalling
7386773 the whole kennedy family will be in a special section it should be quite a moment
7386774 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7386775 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7386776 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7386777 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7386778 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7386779 its a basket of crude oil we cannot be sure where the conglomeration of the product comes from
7386780 im assisting in the safety and security of the american people
7386781 what im telling you is theres too many junk lawsuits suing too many doctors
7386782 you need to toughen up boy youll never be a cowboy if you are scared of cows
7386783 and i like when you eat guava too it makes your poopy diapers smell rather tropical and exotic like you want to serve it on a platter with a pink umbrella stuck in it while you bask in the sunshine by the infinity pool dude im serious
7386784 you cant put obama vp vetters eric holder and caroline kennedy on an hour plane ride to chappaqua just to check the box they should have done it just for the optics
7386785 barack never even said to her heres how i envision the job not one discussion with her about the position
7386786 they thought her supporters were mad before they are really mad now
7386787 i would say yes as long as it never gets in the way of the show it would be great to see it at the cinema its been there before so it would be good to see it again a movie is 90 minutes thats not that different from making a single episode so im not against it
7386788 i would not rule out a film version of doctor who no
7386789 he is going to have to simply really attract some attention
7386790 this particular process has exposed to the country that evan bayh is not only mentioned as a great former governor but a leader
7386791 this has only further enhanced his profile as a national leader
7386792 i share the disappointment of many hoosiers that my partner in the senate evan bayh was not selected on this occasion but i believe he will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7386793 theres nothing wrong with giving up so long as what youre giving is good and youre not giving it in too upward a direction
7386794 when live gives you lemons dont put them into a story nobody needs those kind of lemons
7386795 well im lookin for a girl whos virtuous cause god laid it on my heart to search for this so i open up the word to the book of proverbs the 31st chapter tells me all about her charm is deceitful and beauty is vain a woman who fears the lord she aint playin hear what im sayin cause im sayin it clearly shes the kind of girl i gots to have near me ya see god will bring her to me so i dont have to search

7386798 i am interested in whats behind all the ratings and reviews we read the level of scrutiny is not sufficient
7386799 this is a program that recognizes the efforts restaurants put into their wine lists
7386800 this gets down to what the wine spectator is all about its not exactly wine for dummies its more wine for the gullible
7386801 this gives the appearance of paying for advertising disguised as a contest
7386802 rated as one of the top 100 hotels in the world

7386807 what role would you like me to play in the presentation
7386808 when you see an opportunity to jump in just be ready to support my position with some sort of joyful agreement
7386809 that sounds like a foolish plan from a foolish man
7386810 thanks for agreeing to meet with us i have prepared a presentation to familiarize you with our olympic features and then would like to discuss ways to customize our assets into a program that helps your client activate their olympic sponsorship on a local level
7386811 in fact there is a picture of him with juan antonio samaranch the head honcho of the internation olympic committee on our brochure
7386812 thats not ed hula that is billy payne local lawyer who had practically singlehandedly brought the olympics to atlanta
7386813 we are here today to express our los angeles times
7386814 no other conductor in recent years has made so naked a political gesture in the middle of an ongoing conflict as shostakovichs seventh
7386815 the camera is an instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera
7386816 photos always seem to exist as sort of stuffy unnecessary antiques that we put in a drawer unless we take them out put them in current dialogue and give them relevance
7386817 what the modern means of reproduction have done is destroy the authority of art and to remove it or rather to remove the images which they reproduce from any preserve for the first time ever images of art have become ephemeral ubiquitous insubstantial available valueless free they surround us the way language surrounds us the art of the past no longer exists as it once did its authority is lost in its place there is a language of images what matters now is who uses that language for what purpose
7386818 p hotographs depend for their meaning on networks of authority the image supplies little in itself what counts is its use and the power to fix a particular interpretation of the events objects or people depicted some people and especially some institutions have much more clout in this processs than others do
7386819 the first question must always be who is using this photograph and to what end
7386820 by contrast almost all writing about photography in our times tends to begin with the alleged nature of the product rather than with its production and use
7386821 review of george lewis a power stronger than itself the aacm and american experimental music
7386822 picturing the public in black amp white working notes inspired by robert westbrooks democratic hope pragmatism amp the politics of truth
7386823 the opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude
7386824 can it still be controversial to say that an apparently disengaged poetics may also speak a political language of self enclosed complacency passivity opportunism false neutrality
7386825 those who say that art should not propagate doctrines usually refer to doctrines that are opposed to their own
7386826 hard and fast categories tend to be instruments used by the victors
7386827 my position is that you cannot work towards peace being peaceful if the peace is to be one where everybodys quiet and doesnt open up share whats unspeakable offer unsolicited criticism defend others rights to speak and encourage discourse that peace is worth nothing it reminds me of the kind of peace that was secured in my old country under the communist regime that is the death of democracy that might have consequences as bad as war bloody war and conflict so to prevent the world from bloody conflict we must sustain a certain kind of adversarial life in which we are struggling with our problems in public
7386828 apolitical art and artless politics are the fruit of a divide and conquer strategy that weakens both art and politics ignite each other and need each other
7386829 i am interested in a political art that is to say an art of ambiguity contradiction uncompleted gestures and uncertain endings an art and a politics in which optimism is kept in check and nihilism at bay
7386830 most of all photography is probably an instrument for showing things a device for displaying them
7386831 democracy is a proposal rarely realised about decision making it has little to do with election campaigns
7386832 605 one of the most dangerous ideas for a philosopher is oddly enough that we think with or in our heads 606 the idea of thinking as a process in the head in a completely enclosed space gives him something occult 607 is thinking a specific organic process of the mind so to speak as it were chewing and digesting in the mind can we replace it by an inorganic process that fulfills the same end as it were a prosthetic apparatus for thinking how should we have to imagine a prosthetic organ of thought
7386833 if one takes the view that human mental activity depends for its full expression upon being linked to a cultural tool kit a set of prosthetic devices so to speak then we are well advised when studying mental activity to take into account the tools employed in that activity
7386834 i want to take you higher baby baby baby light my fire
7386835 the questions a photographer raises may be more profound than the answers the medium permits
7386836 because you know the photographs are more a question than a reply
7386837 a picture can be an answer as well as a question but if you cant answer your question try to question your question there are clever questions and stupid answers as well as stupid questions and clever answers there can be questions without answers but no answers without questions
7386838 the best art makes your head spin with questions perhaps this is the fundamental distinction between pure art and pure design while great art makes you wonder great design makes things clear
7386839 i dont think it is the function of art to be pleasing art is not democratic
7386840 we may distinguish between two types of imaginative process the one starts with the word and arrives at the visual image and the one starts with the visual image and arrives at its verbal expression
7386841 there is something embarrassing in the way in which turning suffering into images harsh and uncompromising though they are wounds the shame we feel in the presence of the victims for these victims are used to create something works of art that are thrown to the consumption of a world which destroyed them the so called artistic representation of the sheer physical pain of people beaten to the ground by rifle butts contains however remotely the power to elicit enjoyment out of it the moral of this art not to forget for a single instant slithers into the abyss of its opposite the aesthetic principle of stylization makes an unthinkable fate appear to have had some meaning it is transfigured something of its horror removed this alone does an injustice to the victims yet no art which tried to evade them could confront the claims of justice
7386842 the test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function one should for example be able to see that things are hopeless and yet be determined to make them otherwise
7386843 a photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second or one sixteenth or one one hundred and twenty eighth snap your fingers a snapshots faster
7386844 the greatest obstacle to transforming the world is that we lack the clarity and imagination to conceive that it could be different
7386845 another world is not only possible she is on her way on a quiet day i can hear her breathing
7386846 a limited imagination defends itself against recognizing the world as a system of connected vessels it also is incapable of moving beyond the familiar
7386847 great numbers however cause particular difficulties for our imagination as if we observe humanity in a way that is not permitted for humans and allowed only to gods in other words they can think in categories of masses a million people more a million less what difference does it make
7386848 politics depends to a great extent on judging what is actual relative to what is possible however we have an inherently weak grasp of what is possible and most societies are not set up so as naturally to improve this or to make us aware of possibilities we may have ignored or taken with insufficient seriousness
7386849 thanks for the interest in the puppy ive had so many great responses that its taking awhile to go through them all in the meantime itd be great if you could check out insert dog training url here its a great dog training program that ive been using and would love it if the new owners continued the training with the puppy
7386850 we know that the heart deteriorates as people get older and thats largely because they dont stay as active as they used to
7386851 past research has suggested that exercise can reverse some effects of aging and we wanted to see what effect it would have specifically on the heart
7386852 by that gauge the women had a better response to exercise training than the men
7386853 at this point the significance of that isnt clear we know that in animal studies low fatty acid oxidation leads to heart muscle thickening and that when men train their heart muscle often gets thicker than womens it could be that the increase in fatty acid oxidation in womens hearts with training is a reason why their hearts dont thicken as much
7386854 here at the school of medicine we are uniquely able to look at the metabolism of the heart because we have the right combination of technology and expertise in cardiology radiology and radiochemistry
7386855 we are one of the few places that can do this kind of study
7386856 in the past heart failure patients were told to limit their activity
7386857 now more and more were seeing there is potentially a benefit to getting them as active as possible we want to know if heart failure patients will experience the same benefit in heart metabolism with exercise that we saw for older people

7386867 there were photographers there and i told them exactly where i was going to go i said right there make sure you wait for me there its just a positive attitude
7386868 they kept telling me push push push and i was pushing to the limit
7386869 that was fun a lot of fun oh my god this is awesome weve been close so often we never lost faith this is great for detroit
7386870 we would not have won this race if helio hadnt driven the wheels off it when he needed to we will keep going and see where we end up at the end of the year
7386871 i think our approach next weekend is the same we go for broke thats the only thing that is going to get us where we need to be
7386872 it was definitely a bad day we lost a ton of points
7386873 this is a race thats very tough unfortunately we got the bad end of the stick i guess we just need to shrug it off and come back strong next week
7386874 i think if helio wins the next two races we just have to place fourth so we should be able to do that
7386875 we just have to stay behind him were ok we have a long way to go yet
7386876 im not upset with anybody particularly we just did absolutely nothing right

7386884 exposing darwinisms weakest link why evolution cant explain human existence
7386885 nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution
7386886 something went to considerable trouble to specifically design humanity to a particular plan
7386887 it can be scientifically demonstrated that there was an intelligent thing creating species instead of the processes currently accepted
7386888 something went to considerable trouble to specifically design humanity to a particular plan
7386889 you dont need god or angels and demons to explain x
7386890 there is a big scientific debate about this worth teaching
7386891 you have not understood the science you are arguing against
7386892 you are attempting to support a predetermined conclusion regardless of the facts
7386893 he grossi said that he bai let him into the apartment
7386894 there was no argument or fight that led up to this
7386895 we were sitting out here on the deck and we could hear it
7386896 we were on vacation and thats not something you want to come home to
7386897 its a very eerie feeling that something like this could happen in the neighborhood
7386898 i want to try and get it back if anybody is entitled to the proceeds i think it should be the victims
7386899 police departments cant just take property if a police agency would apply and is served with a forfeiture it has to go through court they have to prove several things including it was purchased with ill gotten money
7386900 we use it as a utility vehicle and for us it saved the taxpayers of jackson to have to purchase the vehicle
7386901 i am looking at this as helping to recover costs of the investigation
7386902 we had to winterize the boat and we took both those items and stored them at the police department
7386903 we probably saved hundreds of thousands of dollars in storage fees
7386904 our easy access to plastic is about to dry up and with it our ability to fake living the good life
7386905 for the past several years the average inflation adjusted total pay of american workers hasnt been increasing that means we havent been building a foundation for increases in our living standard you might be tempted to say that by definition our living standard couldnt have increased but thats not quite right even with stagnant real incomes we can always live a little better every year through borrowing and pretending that our living standard is still rising just as it was for decades
7386906 it may be that the standard of living bubble finally has to deflate sustainable increases in living standards have to be earned not borrowed and that means performing ever higher value work that cant be outsourced we havent been meeting that challenge very well doing so will probably require much more and better education for millions of americans which takes time and money the result may feel like deprivation but i dont see it that way who knows we might even find that living within our means and saving a little money actually isnt so bad
7386907 im pleased to see some of you with very solid focus here today
7386908 i know this subject can be hard and some of you are clearly frustrated but are keeping at it anyway and so special kudos to you
7386909 for those of you who have never done this before thank you for giving me and this subject your time and attention and willingness
7386910 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states
7386911 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots he has the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that might come up
7386912 youve got to have experience to run and obama doesnt but i dont want to vote for mccain either i dont know if i am going to vote
7386913 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7386914 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7386915 it was a good choice sen biden shores up the foreign policy and defense experience
7386916 it was a strong pick clinton will bring some baggage namely bill
7386917 obama should have picked someone younger and so should mccain
7386918 we need some new blood in washington we keeping getting the same old guys all the time
7386919 im real confident now i mean i never thought id score four tds in a game but i did me and tiger quarterback michael clark connected thats going to be all season
7386920 all ive got to say is hes real fast i think were going to be doing a lot of that this season i hope so
7386921 our offense is starting to find some rhythm is more a way of putting it i take whats given buchtel set us up for some one on one matchups that we had to try and take advantage of
7386922 if we go two wideouts then they have eight nine guys in the box so we play actioned them and we were one on one we run what we call a double move down here on that last one bo put a great move on them mike led him and he went and caught it
7386923 if i get open im going to get the ball no matter what if its coming to me im going to go get it
7386924 if bo gets a step on you and the balls led youre not going to catch him
7386925 i never thought i would get in two touchdowns in a game
7386926 four is unbelievable i never thought i would do that
7386927 they couldnt keep enough oxygen in the tanks and it got septic
7386928 we have central air conditioning and we could smell it in the home even with the windows and doors closed
7386929 this has been going on for over a year last summer i was pregnant and couldnt spend any time outdoors because it made me sick
7386930 it was a summation of several weeks of elevated temperatures
7386931 we dont have a problem of losing oxygen in the cooler months of the year in the summer the wastewater because it is in tanks that are above ground and is exposed to sunlight and high temperatures
7386932 the loss of oxygen means a greater chance of odor
7386933 this is not in reaction to something that happened this summer this clarifier project has been in the works since february of this year
7386934 one thing the community needs to know and doesnt have access to normally is that every change we make whether its the addition of a chemical treatment or new equipment any process change has to go before the village of brewster for approval it also has to go through a lengthy process with the epa for approval those protections are in place to make sure people are getting the right exposure and the epa knows what we are doing before we make those changes its not an overnight process
7386935 when you look at the village of brewster wastewater treatment plant they have one person one shift five days a week
7386936 they routinely send e mails and call me to keep me updated on how the treatment plant is performing they are in touch with me regularly
7386937 it smells like sulfur and rotten eggs its a stench its like i let my golden retriever and cat do whatever they wanted to inside my house
7386938 were designed to be a chip plant and putting in the wastewater facility five years ago opened people up to that exposure where they wouldnt have been if the municipality had the right infrastructure to support us

7386940 umno menggunakan isu bertubi tubi menyerang anwar di sat saat akhir mungkin akan menggoyangkan pengundi atas pagar
7386941 lagipun kawasan permatang pauh kecil dan jalan rayanya pula agak sempit dan sibuk kehadiran orang luar yang luar biasa bilangannya hanya akan memburukkan lagi keadaan itu
7386942 itu belum lagi dikira dengan keadaan kesesakan yang sedia ada di kawasan berkenaan oleh itu saya minta supaya pihak pihak yang tidak terlibat dengan pilihan raya ini supaya janganlah datang ke permatang pauh
7386943 while im gratified that we won i dont think anyone that understands or appreciates good football could be happy with the way we played
7386944 im gratified that we won but we still have to demonstrate a lot of improvement in how we play the game
7386945 i thought our defense was really valiant most of the night
7386946 on three separate occasions copley was inside our red zone and inside our 10 yard line and we generated three turnovers a hard hit caused a fumble we stripped a guy to cause a fumble and we had an interception had those things not occurred then we would not have won
7386947 sometimes you make your own breaks and sometimes the ball bounces your way all of those things are true but we continued to play and scratch and claw and contested every inch of the field and at least in those three instances our defense came up really big for us
7386948 we cant continue to win if were only rushing for 68 yards a game
7386949 thats pitiful and we cant hope to win if we dont run the ball better than that its a combination of things missed assignments and poor execution in the running game actually cost us more than inefficiency in throwing the ball i dont think we ran to the right places i dont think we took full advantage of the blocking that we had at times theres room for improvement both up front and with the guys running the ball
7386950 at this particular point were true to character unfortunately in that we had several self inflicted wounds that kept us from being more productive on offense
7386951 we threw the ball and caught it pretty well we completed a pretty nice percentage of our passes and we spread the ball around to a number of different receivers
7386952 we really didnt do anything the first two series so theyre gonna keep blitzes going
7386953 trying to get the ball out faster than you need to because youre worried about something
7386954 at times he did the right thing and the people he was throwing to were not on the same page as him
7386955 in the second quarter we started seeing some of the things they were doing and started adjusting
7386956 overall we just didnt execute on some of those plays
7386957 i think he played well youd probably have to ask him
7386958 when they come back its going to take some time to knock the rust off
7386959 its not just going to automatically happen that were going to be back to where we want to be
7386960 it was a big win on the road starting off the season but now were right back at it were preparing to face a very strong dalton team on friday
7386961 if you have momentum then you want to go ahead and make it
7386962 at that point we went for two we werent playing for overtime
7386963 were going to play every opponent to the best of our ability
7386964 we were very fortunate in that game to come out of there the way we did it wouldve been nice to hold on to the lead but unfortunately the momentum changed we were able to fight back and win the game
7386965 the more you can trust the guy next to you the better you do in adversity youre able to fight adversity and work as a team to overcome it were going to continue fighting and play to the last second
7386966 im not sure beating south range gives you any more credibility
7386967 i know were going to step into a tough dalton game theyre playing great football i know their coach bob ramsay does a great job of getting them ready you have to put wins behind you and focus on the game coming up its been a long battle for many years
7386968 it was a large team effort a lot of kids touched ball im excited that we were able to spread that wealth around a little bit we want to make sure you have to account for all 11 guys that are on the field
7386969 i treat this matter delicately because this person needs privacy
7386970 much respect to spain but the u s is back on top again
7386971 we played with great character in one of the great games in international basketball history i think
7386972 i know that we had a tough road ahead of us we knew that these guys werent going to roll over and give up that easily
7386973 so we had to be men and thats what it takes to win
7386974 we knew coming in that spain was going to be a big problem
7386975 pasai apa tak bawak ini makcik mai tolong angkat dia masuk saya punya kereta sah makcik ni patah tulang tak buleh nak bangun buleh mamat bonggok ni tercegat dengan hp dia tulung tidak sekali celaka punya mamat

7386977 our rallies have attracted hundreds of thousands of people in the past nearly 15 days which were all peaceful
7386978 thats how things should be but its ok if fill with the situation theyre in
7386979 its kind of a cool place and everybody is fantastic that works here
7386980 we celebrated over 100 episodes last year so its a big deal
7386981 the whole crew gets to come out and gets a bonding experience that way
7386982 the only part of fayetteville ive seen is this stadium
7386983 i think its actually really nice i dont know how big fayetteville is but this is a good size arena for a town
7386984 we just needed something that looked like a nice beautiful big time basketball arena
7386985 a researchers skill in conducting interviews has a direct impact on the quality and accuracy of research findings and subsequent decisions about design
7386986 in many interview formats a significant portion of each session involves ad hoc probing follow up questions that require researchers to think quickly to maximize their time with participants

7387059 there is a little bit of a change that is occurring
7387060 and part of that is whats happening with the economy were fortunate in park forest that the foreclosure rate is not as high in our community as some of the others it seems to be much higher in communities where theres a lot of new housing where people got into the homes that are 350 000 or 400 000 they had some questionable mortgages no money down and now theyre not able because of the economy to keep up with the costs of maintaining that home
7387061 were not seeing as much of a problem as some of our neighboring communities but there has been considerable increase just in the number of homes that are in foreclosure
7387062 where are we today in 2008 well were seeing a significant jump in this neighborhood there are now twenty six homes that are in foreclosure of those twenty six twelve of them are either vacant or have been foreclosed on
7387063 it seems to be a problem residents are trying to keep their properties decent and presentable there seems to be a problem with the upkeep of that property
7387064 the property went tax delinquent the village had to take every avenue it could to secure the property its part of a long range plan for the transit oriented development where we hope to have a real hub of activity serving the north end or our community

7387068 amalgam ist besser als sein ruf die aktuelle studie zeigt auf dass der f llstoff nicht sch dlicher ist als andere materialien es gibt und das muss man auch ganz klar sagen patienten die auf amalgam allergisch reagieren die amalgam nicht vertragen gleiches gilt aber auch f r f llungen aus gold oder aus kunststoff
7387069 amalgam enth lt quecksilber und das gelangt ber den zahn in den k rper dabei handelt es sich aber um anorganisches quecksilber aus legierungen und dies ist deutlich weniger sch dlich als organisches quecksilber das wir durch nahrung aufnehmen zum beispiel durch fisch
7387070 wer keine beschwerden hat sollte das amalgam auf alle f lle in seinem zahn belassen auch der austausch kann probleme mit sich bringen zum beispiel geht zahnsubstanz verloren und es gibt auch eine reihe von patienten die auf die neuen f llstoffe allergisch reagieren zum beispiel auf kunststoffe
7387071 ganz wichtig ist die eigenen f higkeiten die handwerklichen f higkeiten und den zeitbedarf realistisch einzusch tzen nur die arbeiten zu machen die man tats chlich kann arbeiten gut zu planen und nat rlich auch wenn freunde und verwandte mithelfen das die gut versichert sind
7387072 ich w rde in jedem fall empfehlen diese ger te vorher beim ausleiher auszuprobieren weil es handelt sich um solche sachen wie ein kernbohrer oder trennschleifer oder eine r ttelplatte die hat man vorher noch nie gesehen geschweige denn in der hand gehabt und wie soll man damit umgehen

7387074 selber hand anlegen kann man zum beispiel bei dekorativen arbeiten sp ter in der innenausstattung beispielsweise wenn es um das tapezieren geht
7387075 wichtig ist ja dass man hinterher in sein haus auch gesund einziehen kann ich denke ein muss sind sicherheitsschuhe festes schuhwerk mit stahlkappen und dann je nachdem was f r arbeiten man ausf hrt geh rschutz augenschutz oder ein helm und schutzhandschuhe
7387076 ein guter lotse ist der check bauen im internet unter www check bauen de zehn schritte f r kosteng nstiges und qualit tsgerechtes bauen hier kommt es vor allen dingen darauf an dass man mit kompetenten fachleuten mit einer sorgf ltigen planung und gut abgestimmt mit allen beteiligten baut

7387183 the accused person is actively trying to deceive police by inferring other people were involved in the matter
7387184 if there is any breach of bail he could be spending a long time in custody

7387190 right on right on where do you breathe air now
7387191 i usually breathe air at work and a few places in the neighborhood
7387192 yeah i breathe air at some friends houses sometimes do you breathe air online
7387193 i breathe air on poker stars hollywood poker full tilt etc
7387194 this discovery puts a tragic end to two weeks of anguish and despair
7387195 we wish to thank the people of victoria our family and friends in melbourne and mauritius the media auburn south primary school collingwood english language school and melbourne girls college for their assistance and prayers
7387196 last but not least we will be eternally grateful to the victorian police victorias finest men and women in uniform who did not leave any stones unturned in their quest in bringing yadav back to us

7387203 between 1962 and 1967 two notes appeared in our mailbox there was a single sentence written on them i am doing fine but if those letters were really from my father i do not know

7387207 please tell me where you work so i can come up with a silly name for it
7387208 nobody remembers any autistic children in somalia im sure there must have been some but there were not that many
7387209 we have a condition that has no known cause and there is no cure and people are looking to us to provide them with answers
7387210 not only is it high among us here but we somalis dont accept this disorder
7387211 the parents feel like it is something that has happened to their children here
7387212 what were trying to do is find out if it is true that theres this alarming incidence
7387213 we dont have a blood test or a lab test to say you have autism so its somewhat subjective
7387214 the bottom line is that we dont have enough information
7387215 we know that more children are diagnosed today than in the past
7387216 a lot of it is the change in what we call autism but we cant say that explains all of it
7387217 we certainly get indications that autism exists in other communities of the world
7387218 but whether it exists to the same degree as common its not quite as clear
7387219 n s viemos de uma boa seq ncia mas o empate no final foi um resultado importante para n s
7387220 conversei bastante com o abade durante o jogo hoje domingo e isso v lido s vezes voc vai conversar na boa e o juiz te xinga te d o cart o
7387221 a maioria dos cart es que eu tomei foi por culpa minha acabo ficando nervoso durante a partida uma coisa minha tenho que tomar cuidado ficar mais tranq ilo isso que estou fazendo e espero continuar assim
7387222 uma coisa fazer escola e outra n o colocar a regra em pr tica se a falta existe tem que dar temos que ter interpreta o
7387223 aqui na am rica do sul os jogadores chamam para o drible e isso aumenta o n mero de faltas na europa o jogo s de mudan a de dire o lan amentos em velocidade por isso tem menos faltas
7387224 estiquei a perna um pouco depois do gol e me machuquei tomara que n o seja nada s rio
7387225 cada jogador deve defender seus interesses e robinho bem grandinho para isso
7387226 cada jogador deve defender seus interesses e robinho bem grandinho para isso n o uma crian a respeito o muito porque passei por situa es similares limites
7387227 foram um jogador mais n o havia margem de erro e a torcida supriu os dois jogadores que nos faltava por causa das expuls es
7387228 let me bring you to this malay chicken rice place
7387229 eles demonstram realmente que querem fazer parte de um grupo
7387230 eles demonstram realmente que querem fazer parte de um grupo o ballack ainda tem um problema no p e jogou os 90 minutos superou se lampard teve uma pequena les o aos 30 minutos e suportou bem essien que n o treina h alguns dias pois est voltando de les o fez um treino na sexta e s bado e se colocou disposi o
7387231 isso mostra realmente o esp rito da equipe do chelsea fiquei contente com o grupo e como conquistaram os tr s pontos foi um excelente resultado fora de casa
7387232 as equipes que jogam em casa aqui na inglaterra pressionam muito isso faz com que seus jogadores tenham atitudes mais fortes fizemos o gol logo no in cio e eles tiveram que pressionar o wigan tem jogadores no aspecto f sico avantajados com muito jogo ereo foi uma partida muito disputada dentro daquilo que conhecemos do futebol ingl s
7387233 i think osorio will be the next great mls coach i dont think he will go anywhere unless a big euro club calls him
7387234 vi a batalha dos aflitos na concentra o do s o paulo agora pude vivenciar um pouco isso esse est dio gremista tem a cor vermelha mas do gr mio fazer gol aos 48 minutos n o f cil
7387235 desde que cheguei quarta e domingo quarta e domingo n o d tempo de fazer jogadas ensaiadas finaliza o eu confio nos jogadores e eles n o tiveram culpa daquilo que receberam esses atletas s o mais v timas do que perdedores voc s puderam perceber a disparidade entre as duas equipes hoje domingo no preparo f sico
7387236 eu nunca peguei coisa boa sempre pego os clubes em situa o dif cil vai custar tempo mas vamos sair disso mais dif cil brigar embaixo porque o sofrimento maior voc n o dorme porque planeja e n o sai do jeito que voc quer se eles ca rem para a segunda divis o v o perder mercado e ningu m quer isso eles n o querem perder
7387237 um jogo que n s temos interesse mas a prioridade outra a sul americana tira o foco do time mas temos de respeitar porque um direito que o clube conquistou
7387238 quando n s jogamos com o botafogo com um sistema que eu n o gosto a gente marcou melhor n o deixou o botafogo jogar
7387239 we must speed up our work to achieve membership of the european system of security and raise the defense capabilities of the country
7387240 only these steps will guarantee our security and the integrity of our borders
7387241 1888autotransport com aims to change the paradigms of auto transport by being the one stop solution to all auto transport needs
7387242 we have had a turnaround of more than 150 million in net current assets and the net worth of the company has improved from 18 million to 91 million
7387243 its going to take a fair while to earn that back you cant sustain those sorts of losses for long periods
7387244 when your industry is already under incredible pressure every additional pressure ends up making more and more businesses marginal
7387245 the general rule of thumb for one job lost in a car plant theres a knock on effect of maybe six or seven times that amount
7387246 there should be a freeze on tariffs we said all along why would australia proceed to reduce our tariffs at a time when the rest of the world isnt
7387247 since ive come on board we have launched and gotten approval for a different business plan for ford australia over the next five years
7387248 if youre going to tax people tax the gas guzzlers that what it comes down to
7387249 barring any talks in the meantime greens senator christine milne will be moving in the senate to have the government withdraw the bill and redraft it to make it climate friendly
7387250 surely a bit of commonsense there will be levied by the senate if the government doesnt improve its intention there to tax some of the more expensive or luxury cars available on the market
7387251 if its a hybrid vehicle an ultra low emissions vehicle it doesnt make sense to me without cutting edge technology getting slugged in the same way as a gas guzzling maserati
7387252 of the worlds 900 million vehicles 96 depend on petroleum
7387253 gm is focused on a strategy to reduce our dependence on petroleum the key is to focus on efficiency and energy diversity
7387254 that will give us the learnings we need to do gen 2 and gen 3 not just on batteries but on motors power electronics range extenders we are going to come up with a lot of clever ways to generate electricity other than an internal combustion engine
7387255 hydrogen infrastructure is already widely distributed most of your homes have natural gas delivered to them natural gas is a beautiful carrier of hydrogen
7387256 the next step is to build 1000 of them and get a real manufacturing and supply base in place
7387257 i think you need an energy policy that can bring stability to energy prices one of the things i get concerned about is what would happen if oil dropped back to us20 a barrel i dont think that would be healthy for the world
7387258 fifteen years ago i woke up in the middle of the night and i couldnt hear
7387259 i lived an entire year deaf and then i heard about an australian who had invented a bionic ear
7387260 we absolutely appreciate the cost of fuel and how it affects people but no one should be compromising safety for the sake of a few dollars
7387261 there is no point trying to save money on fuel if youre then going to incur more costs because youre involved in a crash whether its damage to the vehicle or more importantly damage to the occupants of the vehicle
7387262 if youre driving that close to the edge of the road its easy to come off and youre then likely to shred your tyres
7387263 it also poses a risk to cyclists and pedestrians youre too close to them
7387264 they are sensible ways of driving where you are integrating safety and fuel saving
7387265 its good to have a heightened awareness about what you can do to reduce fuel consumption but i think some people can take it too far
7387266 at the end of the day if adding weight to your vehicle increases fuel consumption youre not going to tell one of the kids to get out and walk are you
7387267 its the same with tailgating yes you might save money but thats no good if youre dead you should never put money above safety
7387268 nice piece 5 yrs old belongs to my gf and she wants to sell it
7387269 was of the belief that these sexual interactions would be a positive experience for her daughter and that richards would receive sexual gratification
7387270 then there is the collectivist bullshit about new zealand winning like every fat prick in a lazyboy had anything to do with it
7387271 it was my six days of being well it was like a trance it was so wonderful it was so great to be with my daughter again
7387272 you know i lost i lost big time in boston
7387273 hand printed and bound on recycled paper with eco friendly ink
7387274 it is not a great film its an entertaining film thats the kind of cinema i believe in
7387275 its my first home production and ive dedicated the film to my late secretary mr vikas bali and to my father theyd be so proud of singh is kinng
7387276 thats a scary thought and i dont want to think about it
7387277 700 billion are leaving this country to foreign nations every year the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
7387278 w e can provide loan guarantees and venture capital to those with the best plans to develop and sell biofuels on a commercial market
7387279 anyone who develops such a device will earn profits dwarfing 300 million simply by selling it on the market theres absolutely no need for any such
7387280 it was obviously the news i didnt want to hear
7387281 while he was here i was producing so its not a situation in which now that hes gone i have to step up
7387282 i havent really talked to anyone at this point in time about anything to be honest with you
7387283 i am sure that general manager jerry reese and i and ownership will look long and hard at whatever options are out there and do what is best here at this point in time
7387284 i havent heard from anybody else so to say if i would or wouldnt come back is premature so im enjoying my retired life right now
7387285 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7387286 i think its in the best interest of our team and our player that he hears anything that i have to say from me to him first
7387287 we know we have the personnel to step up in his absence
7387288 obviously hes a pro bowler you cant replace someone like that without feeling it at least a little bit but we understand we do have enough people here to get the job done
7387289 any time you have 12 penalties and 10 of them are on offensive plays thats an issue
7387290 thats something we have to do a much better job on
7387291 it just looks really bad when they start coming in piles it just doesnt look good when you are fighting yourself it becomes second and long third and long its just not a good situation
7387292 we had some big plays that were unfortunately called back
7387293 all we have to do is watch the film to see that we have a lot of potential it just goes to show how little things can lead to big things they are things that can be corrected rather quickly and easily but you cant win making those types of mistakes
7387294 i didnt do a good enough job emphasizing getting the tackles up even tighter than they were
7387295 like i said that did come down from the league that was a point of emphasis anytime thats a point of emphasis you better get it fixed and you better get it straightened out i could have done a much better job with that the other ones illegal shifts were concentration errors where we had two guys moving
7387296 as disappointing as it was that those plays were called back we see at the end result how good it can be
7387297 you can say were close its a matter of opinion but the fact is if we clean those up i think we can be pretty productive
7387298 i have only done 10 repairs in hopewell in 10 years
7387299 yeah thats this american life its a podcast and its really good you should listen to it
7387300 rafa will feel what i have been feeling for the past five years
7387301 during the five years i thought it was necessary to win every tournament but now things have changed
7387302 nadal will feel the pressure of being world no 1 it will be interesting to see how he handles favouritism on all surfaces after demonstrating such great form this year
7387303 for now he is the favourite for the us open
7387304 i have to start with care i have been very consistent this year in grand slam events but nadal is playing very very well and deserves to be no 1
7387305 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7387306 yes daddy i need to be punished ive been a naughty girl
7387307 help me be a good girl daddy i cant stop these dirty thoughts in my head
7387308 fuck you feel so good god i love to get fucked

7387313 i have been wearing extensions for years and there is nothing out there like this product every woman should have one
7387314 her hands kept reaching up to make sure the hair extensions were still there
7387315 my goal was to bring myself and my personality into this project
7387316 too ready criminalisation of children and young people for minor offences
7387317 there is a good deal of anecdotal evidence for example that behaviour particularly that of children and young people is being criminalised which arguably would be better dealt with informally school related misbehaviour for example and in previous times was
7387318 the increased use of pre court summary justice is one of the most important elements in the governments strategy for modernising the criminal justice system the implementation of the strategy has received virtually no research inspectoral or parliamentary scrutiny
7387319 the trend towards pre court summary justice should more incisively be scrutinised to ensure that justice is being meted out fairly and effectively we cannot be wholly confident that this is so
7387320 labours ad hoc and distorted approach has created the worst of both worlds not only are serious offenders escaping real justice due to the reliance on spot fines but as this report shows many people who should be dealt with informally are being criminalised
7387321 the best way to avoid a criminal record is not to break the law the law abiding majority want to see crimes dealt with effectively and fixed penalty notices and cautions are part of this process
7387322 they allow police to deal swiftly with low level offending freeing them up to spend more time on frontline duties and more time investigating violent dangerous and serious offences they also free up court time for more serious cases
7387323 we recognise it is of course highly offensive to a lot of people
7387324 the mayor is deeply disturbed and has made it clear that the film should not be shown in london house again
7387325 this is a general three minute video of london in which an artwork by marcus harvey very fleetingly appears
7387326 the video is not for general public use and has been used many times over the last few years to show to the tourism trade
7387327 there has never been a complaint made about the video up until this point however if any offence has been caused we will withdraw it from use with immediate effect
7387328 ive never been north but im at chelsea for two seasons so i must get used to bolton manchester united manchester city
7387329 what i expected i saw today it was difficult winning 1 0 away from home in england is the same as winning 10 0 elsewhere wigan played better than portsmouth and had players who are healthy have power and pressured us i know we didnt play as well as we did last week but i understand the reasons why
7387330 it didnt matter who took them they kept doing the same frigging thing
7387331 theyve had a bad day but the piece of brilliance in the game came from deco if it wasnt him it might have been from nicolas anelka if not him joe cole florent malouda theyve got a string of talent and how do you compete to think that we used to mock rangers and celtic being so dominant in scotland didnt we
7387332 i had to keep giving her the bad news again and again every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7387333 i almost fell off my chair she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7387334 on bad days she could hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she got to the end
7387335 when a friend asked oh margaret do you remember rationing he got a full ten minutes of my mothers best grocers daughters tips on how to jazz up tinned spam or powdered egg
7387336 i cant look at any of them and say they can hold up their hands and say they performed
7387337 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
7387338 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
7387339 once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
7387340 a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
7387341 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
7387342 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and

7387360 the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery it did not collapse from explosives or fuel oil fires
7387361 weve had trouble getting a handle on building no 7
7387362 the specifics of the fires in wtc 7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time although the total diesel fuel on the premises contained massive potential energy only a low probability of occurrence
7387363 sunder proceeded to stumble through some convoluted explanation for why only fire could be responsible seeming caught off guard and uncomfortable

7387388 after discovering that thermal expansion of steel from a low temperature fire led to the collapse of world trade center building 7
7387389 we started realizing that other metal objects might also be at risk
7387390 we also determined that car engines airplane engines and boat engines could all suddenly fail due to thermal expansion
7387391 indeed we soon realized that almost all industrial processes could lead to catastrophic failure other than perhaps those used in freezers

7387396 successive decisions which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
7387397 a fairly widespread culture in european affairs which relegates manifestations of ones own religious convictions to the private and subjective sphere
7387398 it has not been unknown for example for individuals to have to
7387399 ignoring this trend within the eu and its impact on people of faith has inevitable political and social consequences not least on levels of support for the project itself
7387400 i think the people who are hostile to europe need to open their eyes to the contributions of europe and those who are totally supportive of europe need to listen to the concerns and the reservations we need a respectful listening to the views of each side

7387499 the use of lists of words including individual names subjects locations et cetera has long been one of the methods used to sort out information of foreign intelligence value from that which is not of interest in the past such lists have been referred to occasionally as watch lists because the lists were used as an aid to watch for foreign activity of reportable intelligence interest however these lists generally did not contain names of u s citizens or organizations the activity in question is one in which u s names were used systematically as a basis for selecting messages including some between u s citizens when one of the communicants was at a foreign location

7387516 after last week starting with a defeat at hull we really needed something from this game
7387517 of course i am frustrated but when you lose a game it is not always the solution to buy
7387518 we did not create enough chances and have to look at why and how we can do it better i didnt feel we were into the game right from the start and you cant be like that
7387519 we had problems as well to win our early games last year but we did win them and it made things easier now we have to respond
7387520 we had 60 minutes to respond after fulham scored but we did not create a lot and i dont know why

7387529 this is the first time that i have lost four games in a row and it has got to stop now silly basic errors are costing us and that is why we were behind at half time we had chances but we didnt take them and that has to change we are just not converting them when they come along and if that happens things become a struggle

7387543 we do not believe that president nkrumah has decided to align himself completely with the soviet bloc
7387544 leftist policies and positions will probably increase the difficulties of his obtaining private or governmental investment and aid from the west if this trend is aggravated by the wests refusal to honor what is in his view a commitment to finance the volta river project nkrumah will almost certainly react violently and turn even more to the bloc even should the volta project be backed by the us we do not believe that nkrumah will significantly change the present policies of his regime we believe that he will continue his attempts to reduce the dominating influence which private western interests have in many sectors of the ghanaian economy and will continue to develop close economic and political relations with the bloc

7387570 sudans western province is widely viewed in khartoum as a proxy battle ground for the continuing struggle by
7387571 the sudanese government has considerable military power that would enable it to restore order in darfur but is understandably reluctant to divert its resources from the south until the peace process there has been completed
7387572 in some sense the people of darfur are being made to pay the price for the private humiliation of sudans security apparatus resentful that it has had to come to the negotiating table with the south sudans spla
7387573 we know them in detail said one sudanese source we know their leaders how they implement their policies how they plan for the future we have tried to feed this information to american and british intelligence so they can learn how this thing can be tackled
7387574 the cia and fbi following four years of sudanese entreaties sent a joint investigative team to establish whether sudan was in fact a sponsor of terrorism last may it gave sudan a clean bill of health however even then it made no effort to examine the voluminous files on bin laden
7387575 we are assisting these governments in their own defense nothing we are giving them is to be used for any other purpose
7387576 announces the arrest of two named bin laden operatives held the day after the bombings after they crossed the sudanese border from
7387577 us sources have confirmed that the fbi wished to arrange their immediate extradition however clintons secretary of state
7387578 even then sudan held the suspects for a further three weeks hoping the us would both perform their extradition and take up the offer to examine their bin laden database finally the two men were deported to pakistan their present whereabouts are unknown
7387579 the us government decided in 1996 to send nearly 20 million of military equipment through the front line states of ethiopia eritrea and uganda to help the sudanese opposition overthrow the khartoum regime
7387580 however although the intelligence channel between sudan and the united states is now open and the last un sanctions against the african state have been removed the observer has evidence that a separate offer made by sudanese agents in britain to share intelligence with mi6 has been rejected
7387581 if someone from mi6 comes to us and declares himself the next day he can be in khartoum said a sudanese government source we have been saying this for years democracy now reported on may 3 2005
7387582 the january 9 2005 comprehensive peace agreement ending the twenty one year civil war between the sudanese government and southern rebels has brought little significant improvement to sudan in the area of human rights
7387583 throughout 2005 international policy towards sudan vacillated between condemnation and appeasement
7387584 divided interests regarding sudan were prevalent not just bilaterally among western governments but also within the united nations security council
7387585 the north south peace agreement however had major human rights defects including the absence of any mechanism to ensure accountability for abuses committed during the twenty one year war waged mostly in southern sudan

7387587 sudanese recruits have been providing information about individuals passing through sudan to somalia and elsewhere in the horn of africa and iraq the sudanese government is reported to have detained suspects in khartoum at the request of the us the bottom line is that they are bombing their people dealing with sudan it seems like they are always playing both ends against the middle
7387588 a former high ranking official quoted in the los angeles times acknowledged the importance of the intelligence
7387589 intelligence cooperation takes place for a whole lot of reasons its not always between people who love each other deeply
7387590 gordon johndroe a spokesman for the national security council said he did not believe sanctions would ruin intelligence cooperation
7387591 we certainly expect the sudanese to continue efforts against terrorism because its in their own interests not just ours
7387592 the united nations has been struggling for nearly a year to persuade president
7387593 khartoum blinked on tuesday after two days of meetings in ethiopia between sudanese and african union officials sudan agreed to accept the hybrid force
7387594 if there are not enough contributions from africa then troops can be brought in from elsewhere
7387595 sudans agreement sounds great but the international community must keep up the pressure until there are thousands more troops in darfur wearing the u n s blue helmets
7387596 prolonging the war in darfur and the death of thousands of people after the abuja peace agreement just like they did in iraq

7387605 lets see quarter tone scales octoroons oh yes octoroons are people who are only one eighth colored their skin is an eighth tone so if quarter tone scales are quarter tone scales what but no there isnt any point at all to it the jokes on me for thinking there was a point
7387606 but what about the bald headed man and ghosts and dumb dames and tramps and other people and things that are supposed to be funny
7387607 in the second place any other jokes are merely variations of one of the fifteen
7387608 in the third place the list of fifteen includes not all the jokes that could be but only all the jokes that are you might in a sudden spasm of merriment make a joke about something else and occasionally somebody does but those fifteen veterans are of such ancient lineage and they do such universal service that any other joke is a mere upstart and not to be taken seriously
7387609 you are the largest audience i have ever put entirely to sleep
7387610 but as for me i know that my redeemer lives
7387611 but as for me i know that my redeemer lives and that he will stand upon the earth at last and after my body has decayed yet in my body i will see god i will see him for myself yes i will see him with my own eyes i am overwhelmed at the thought
7387612 now about the money being collected for the christians in jerusalem you should follow the same procedures i gave to the churches in galatia on every lords day each of you should put aside some amount of money in relation to what you have earned and save it for this offering dont wait until i get there and then try to collect it all at once
7387613 put aside some amount of money in relation to what you have earned
7387614 i waited patiently for the lord he inclined and heard my cry he brought me up out of the pit out of the miry clay he set my feet upon a rock and made my footsteps firm many will see many will see and hear
7387615 40 became the closing song at u2 shows and on hundreds of occasions literally hundreds of thousands of people of every size and shape t shirt have shouted back the refrain pinched from psalm 6 how long to sing this song i thought of it as a nagging question pulling at the hem of an invisible deity whose presence we glimpse only when we act in love how long hunger how long hatred how long until creation grows up and the chaos of its precocious adolescence has been discarded i thought it odd that the vocalising of such questions could bring such comfort to me too
7387616 choose a good reputation over great riches for being held in high esteem is better than having silver or gold
7387617 give me o god the pledge you demand who else will put up security for me
7387618 i know that my redeemer lives and that in the end he will stand upon the earth and after my skin has been destroyed yet in my flesh i will see god i myself will see him with my own eyes i and not another how my heart yearns within me
7387619 and no wonder for satan himself masquerades as an angel of light
7387620 with the help of the lord i have brought forth the man
7387621 he has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor his righteousness endures forever
7387622 choose a good reputation over great riches for being held in high esteem is better than having silver or gold
7387623 but if you love those who love you what credit is that to you for even sinners love those who love them
7387624 but love your enemies do good and lend hoping for nothing in return and your reward will be great
7387625 im not giving my money to that preacher church denomination etc
7387626 sometimes a set back is nothing but a set up for god to make a come back
7387627 but as for me i know that my redeemer lives and that he will stand upon the earth at last 26 and after my body has decayed yet in my body i will see god 27 i will see him for myself yes i will see him with my own eyes i am overwhelmed at the thought
7387628 my heart it yearns within me for the day when jesus returns my heart it yearns within me for the day when jesus shall reign though my flesh it be destroyed yet with my eyes i will see god for i know that my redeemer lives and i will stand with him on that day
7387629 there is more than one way to god than through jesus

7387635 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7387636 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7387637 since the case is sub judice we cant comment as of now
7387638 however we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release
7387639 today many social conservatives still blame friedan and feminism for inducing women to abandon the home for the workplace thus destabilising families and placing their children at risk but feminism was more of a response to women entering the labour force than its cause in western europe and the united states early capitalism drew huge numbers of young single women into industries like textiles mill owners often built dormitories to house young female workers many of these workers became early supporters of both the anti slavery and the womens rights movements while middle class women were energised by and sometimes envious of working womens vigorous participation in the public sphere by the time friedans book was published in 1963 capitalism was drawing married women into the expanding service clerical and information sectors friedans ideas spoke to a generation of women who were starting to view paid work as something more than a temporary break between adolescence and marriage and were frustrated by societys insistence that the only source of meaning in their lives should be their role as housewives wherever women enter the labour force in large numbers certain processes unfold women begin to marry later and have fewer children especially as they make inroads into higher education or more remunerative careers they are also more likely to challenge laws and customs that relegate them to second class status in the public sphere or mandate their subordination within the family often governments and employers then find that it is in their interest to begin to remove barriers to womens full participation the dramatic decrease in laws and customs perpetuating female subordination over the past 40 years has been closely connected to womens expanded participation in paid employment societies where women remain substantially under represented in the labour market such as in the middle east remain especially resistant to womens rights
7387640 the best hope for improving family life today is not to roll back womens rights but to further womens economic and political integration

7387644 war is like that and the taliban were repulsed eventually so whats the big deal
7387645 americas economy is a war economy not a manufacturing economy not an agricultural economy nor a service economy not even a consumer economy seriously i looked into your eyes america saw deep into your soul so lets get honest and officially call it americas outrageous war economy admit it we secretly love our war economy and thats the answer to jim grants thought provoking question last month in the wall street journal why no outrage there really is only one answer deep inside we love war why else are americans so eager and willing to surrender 54 of their tax dollars to a war machine which consumes 47 of the worlds total military budgets
7387646 youve got it all wrong the corporations that control the decision making process in washington make their money by selling weapons and provisioning wars they just want to make money off the military they dont want to actually go out and conquer countries and stuff that would force them to deal with the human factor i think they would prefer it if we just gave them money to spend on manufacturing missile systems that dont work dreaming up star wars type fantasy projects and creating fabulous new sci fi secret weapons that no one will use and letting the messy stuff slide
7387647 right now nearly the entire us military is either in afghanistan and iraq or going to or coming from those two mouse sized countries and according to some nearly the entire military machine is stretched as tight as a rubber band ready to snap and we are going to need a lot more rubber if the powers that be plan to keep stretching the machine we will need to either re start the draft or to leave afghanistan and iraq

7387652 in a pluralistic post modern world students are having a more difficult time with the idea of people going to hell forever because they didnt believe the right thing
7387653 thats the biggest question out there right now would god send someone to hell if they were someone as good as me but didnt believe what i believe
7387654 ive noticed in the last five years how that view is making inroads even in conservative churches whereas five years ago it wasnt even uttered or discussed
7387655 they believe everyone has an equal chance at this life and the next

7387658 when you fear the lord there is not much else to fear
7387659 if you are trained in medicine and have parented five children you arent going to worry when your neighbor asks you to watch her ten year old for twenty minutes if you really want to fight fear learn to fear someone who captures your attention in such a way that your other fears suddenly seem pedestrian and unimportant

7387671 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7387672 ive just been allowed out hallelujah and gee this is overwhelming oh and sweet mercy how do i steer this thing
7387673 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7387674 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7387675 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7387676 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority of those polled rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7387677 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily

7387797 today has been a truly remarkable and memorable day it was wonderful to spend time getting to know gloria for she is a very smart inspiring and hopeful woman i can honestly say that she gave one of the best speeches i have heard while at hamilton
7387798 i admire the way you interact with every person who has a question or comment for you treating them with warmth and respect you field questions and engage in dialogue with poise wisdom and humor
7387799 thank you for your inspiring presentation this was not a speech it was a conversation a story telling a wake up call and an inspiration
7387800 why id want gloria feldt to speak to my clients first like all superb leaders she recognizes the power of setting audacious goals
7387801 mba students ask tough questions and challenge a leaders assumptions gloria was a most welcome guest in my class as she consistently energized the students with her clear and realistic sense of what it takes to successfully lead a complex organization
7387802 in all the best sense she has embodied many of margaret sangers qualities gloria is a great visionary but at the same time she is very focused on understanding the increments in which you have to realize a vision
7387803 gloria is a practical visionary and they dont come along very often
7387804 as a man i have benefited from glorias leadership she epitomizes leadership being right there up front
7387805 that we really could change the direction of the organizations future
7387806 gloria thank you for sharing your candid honest and wonderful personal stories with our membership
7387807 turners vision of lifes many possibilities even as she gets older is surely inspiring
7387808 kathleen turner will leap out of the pages and into your life as your new best friend because she is as honest as she is adventurous and because shes talking to her own great friend writer gloria feldt her story is full of an intimate energy so infectious that it becomes universal go ahead give yourself this rose of a book
7387809 i will find you a good woman who will love inspire and care for you
7387810 the film takes the point that if you have to fight the toughest person in the world you have to work 24 7 to fight the devil you have to work 25 8 thats where the title came from
7387811 max theirot denzel whitaker shareeka epps and emily meade all star
7387812 the fact is i heard from my agent that a remake of the original nightmare on elm street was going to happen
7387813 the batmans have been done with many different guys so it is possible for a new actor to come in and do something interesting with a roll that has been done by another actor for a long time
7387814 i am one of the three producers we shot in south africa and some in los angeles
7387815 although we know that there have been two test screening with a third already planned what weve heard is that it truly has tested through the roof good news for us horror fans
7387816 wilkins is an avid reader of the site and asked me to help him respond to the fans who were nervous about the use of a cg monster which apparently is not the case
7387817 wilkins cgi skills will be put to use with the virus monster in the film
7387818 the capture of abu tiba and abu othman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi network
7387819 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
7387820 i am thrilled that joe biden will be my vice president
7387821 i think he can help shape a long term strategy to keep america more secure after the disastrous economic and foreign policies that characterized the last eight years
7387822 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots
7387823 the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises
7387824 mostly i think what attracted senator obama was bidens wisdom
7387825 and not the kind of wisdom you get in washington dc but the kind of wisdom you get when you overcome adversity tragedy in your life as he has
7387826 he understands whats going on in this economy he doesnt believe as john mccain does that things are fundamentally sound and weve made great progress when people are losing ground all the time
7387827 i think barack obama did exactly what he said he was going to do he picked someone who complements him
7387828 he picks someone who is of his own mind and will not be a sycophant and picked someone who is knowledgeable in the ways of washington because if barack obama wants to effect change part of doing that is having somebody with you that knows the institutions that you are changing
7387829 great retail campaigner who really connects with people on a visceral level
7387830 they can run any attack ad they want but heres the issue americans want a change in the direction of this nation and especially the economy has come into the fore
7387831 joe is a guy who grew up in a working class household in scranton pennsylvania really understands what it is to have to scrap barack is a guy who comes from no means and no connections mother on food stamps when he was a kid
7387832 this week we saw a sharp distinction as these two candidates understand the plight of normal americans and john mccain cant remember how many houses he owns
7387833 i still have things that i want to do in the sport ive never competed over here in london and im looking forward to really experience more of the city and be able to prepare myself to hopefully swim some fast times
7387834 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7387835 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success
7387836 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7387837 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7387838 the accident happened on a hill near this village when the tg jes flight crashed for unknown reasons according to preliminary information at least 14 people were aboard
7387839 the combination of incremental weakness in the european economy and the lower oil prices should keep the pressure on euro dollar in our view
7387840 the easing of tropical storm fay and the pullout of russian troops from georgia has taken some risk premium out of the market
7387841 but there will be some degree of geopolitical tensions as long as russia still has troops stationed in georgia
7387842 little change in strength is expected before julio reaches the baja peninsula later today and weakening is forecast to begin tonight or early monday
7387843 we have found indications on the surface such as bags socks and ice axes
7387844 a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 meters yards
7387845 there was absolutely no noise it was very disturbing we only had time to swerve to the right before being mowed down
7387846 when i say scene from the apocalypse its because there were a lot of injured it was cold it was dark it was stressful
7387847 numerous trained weather spotters reported several tornadoes between parker and castle rock
7387848 it is only the dead who have seen the end of war
7387849 i do not know what weapons world war 3 will be fought with you
7387850 i really wish that there was a way to get all my emails right in firefox plus notifications
7387851 i really wish i could use mouse gestures like in opera
7387852 we make a point of not promoting the fact that we work there
7387853 brian j noggle apparently forgot that the proper design for a tin foil beanie calls for the shiny side out
7387854 im weeping openly right now thanks for hurting my feelings pinhead
7387855 a 1994 study contended that approximately 1 in 30 000 people born as males and 1 in 100 000 people born as females undergo a sex change operation in this country
7387856 if everything morales says is true was she sexually harassed

7387860 we have agreed to launch a joint education training and employment initiative which will come back to us with specific recommendations for action by years end
7387861 the document lays out in detail a plan by telstra management to sideline unions and cut the pay of thousands of field technicians lines workers and other key staff through new job contracts
7387862 the company aims to hold workers pay to below the rate of inflation effectively cutting its wages bill by almost 15 per cent over four years
7387863 for the average technician this would amount to a cut in real wages over time of 7300 a year
7387864 telstra is a prime example of big employers who are behaving badly towards their staff and thumbing their nose at the rudd governments cooperative industrial relations policy
7387865 we expect to see new laws introduced into the parliament very soon to scrap all of work choices and replace it with a fair and balanced industrial relations system
7387866 we have taken the extra step of talking to wholesale employees about whats important to them and that will be reflected in any proposed agreement
7387867 of course our employees will be able to vote on any proposed agreement
7387868 for the first time many employees may have the opportunity to earn extra money through good performance
7387869 the plan is still to bring senator kennedy in for a short period of time it would be an in and out appearance the source was quoted as saying
7387870 imagine what would happen at the instant that video fades to black the lights in the hall come up and who is standing there center stage but ted himself the living heart and soul of this party mr goldman said
7387871 even if he didnt say a word the place would go absolutely nuts
7387872 the main driver is the financials cmc markets senior dealer dominic vaughan said
7387873 were also seeing the resources sector holding up despite a mixed bag of metal prices overnight
7387874 at this stage the market looks like it may remain relatively well bid by the end of the day but it wouldnt surprise me if we did see some profit taking later on
7387875 huh interesting so it must be that alls fair in baseball card collecting if somebodys main interest is those game used jersey cards instead of the plain cards the expert term is base cards buddy then they must have to get enterprising about it a portable digital scale is pretty enterprising
7387876 nah its not illegal and when kids come along i tell them which packs to get

7387878 hunter biden has never lobbied sen bidens office or committees period hes never worked on a client issue where other members of the firm have lobbied the office hunter shares expenses not revenues with his partners so theres no benefit to him when a partner lobbies sen biden has been as strong a supporter of ethics reform as the senate has known and his office follows all ethics laws right down to the letter
7387879 dennis the thing i like best about you is your wife
7387880 hes got some major problems like internal bleeding and hes on dialysis so his kidneys are failing again and they are talking again about suspected pneumonia so they are three bad reports
7387881 everything is down and its not looking good but weve still got hope
7387882 the eu has been following the forums lead as mentioned by new zealand prime minister helen clark
7387883 that is an issue fiji should be worried about rather than the forums proposed suspension
7387884 i mean it has never happened before so where do you base the forum if fiji is suspended this will have a lot of implications
7387885 this is a huge crisis for the forum and we must understand the decision to suspend fiji was just a consideration by the leaders at this stage
7387886 well currently there are a lot of projects being undertaken and looked by the education ministry
7387887 one of them is the teacher registration board whereby teachers from next year will have to be registered before they can teach in any school
7387888 these professionals ought to have a body that watch the standard of the performance of their own members for example people like doctors lawyers accountants they are all professionals and they ought to have their own registration of their own members to guard against or deal with any problems in the way they do their job
7387889 secondly their behaviour if they dont behave properly they can be sacked and their names can be taken away from the registration list
7387890 higher education can be defined in many ways some people prefer to call it tertiary education but we are just about done in the preparation of the higher education bill which we will take to cabinet in the near future
7387891 when promulgated it will become law on higher education in fiji i am hoping that by the end of august this year we will have that law placed
7387892 i think basically what we think of higher education in fiji as is we think of university like the university of the south pacific usp the university of fiji and may be the fiji school of medical that is higher education for us
7387893 they all have to be registered before they can practice in fiji
7387894 oh you should go and join a guild first and do all the side quests before doing the main quest or it will be too strong
7387895 if you read but one book this year dr frankls book should be that one
7387896 if he turned any more cheeks hed have to pull down his pants
7387897 your warhammer online folder is missing a large number of files
7387898 there was a lot of institutional selling in sterling mr waterer said
7387899 on the back of that we saw some other currencies fall such as the euro and the australian dollar
7387900 it was a follow on from the falls in fridays session
7387901 a stronger us dollar weaker gold theme has seen the aussie dollar retrace below the 0 8650 level mr waterer said
7387902 gold fell on the stronger us dollar and commodity currencies like the aussie have fallen on the back of that

7387911 during the dinner mary kate was very playful with joel it was all fun and games but with the olsens nothing is as simple as that nicole exploded at joel and demanded that they leave the party afterward nicole warned him to stay away from mary kate
7387912 nicole freaked out joel thought shed respect the fact that he was trying to be honest after all he and mary kate are just friends but nicole was hurt and angry he couldnt deal with it so he hung up and she kept texting him after that
7387913 shes been friends with mary kate for a while but she doesnt trust her at all when it comes to joel

7387917 the family has exhausted itself and the whole of society
7387918 i will vote for individuals who respect and love kuwait not those who love their perception of where they stand in kuwait
7387919 i think that war doesnt solve problems i think its the wrong way i have no respect for ppl who decide to have a war im against it and a lot of ppl are luckily against it
7387920 i loved it to be underage at this time you couldnt get into trouble now i need to try to have a good behaviour
7387921 life is like a rollercoaster live it enjoy it and be happy
7387922 i dont want to compared with britney spears ashlee simpson hillary duff or lindsay lohan i just want to be compared with myself
7387923 to know what i am like someone need to know me and be around me and if you are better if im in a good mood dont meet me if im in a bad mood but seriously why should i care what other people think about me i am who i am and i know what i want to be
7387924 if im really angry i need my guitar my guitar is my therapist and i write everything down what i think
7387925 it doesnt mean that you are better than other people if you are famous if im at home i go out with my friends we go shopping to the cinema to clubs i just need to think where to go but i basically can go everywhere i still have a normal life just a little bit harder but i always have great fun
7387926 suggests that battle for the presidency between the illinois senator and republican rival john mccain is all tied up
7387927 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7387928 ladies and gentleman the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing
7387929 loses his impartiality when he talks about the clintons aug 24th 2008
7387930 i think a lot of people want to ride their bike but they dont realize how easy it is around town so were just trying to show people that theyre very efficient routes
7387931 you have to have them to be competitive now grass roots i dont know but to be on the international stage which is what were all about to be on the national stage if people are in them youve got to wear them
7387932 the stitching is very very well done but its not going to be as strong as your other suits because theyre trying to make it as light and buoyant as possible
7387933 retailers said the lzrs fabric is so delicate that you can only swim in them competitively about six to eight times before some significant breakage occurs
7387934 the important thing from the university perspective is the decision making
7387935 i think that thinking goes to the notion that you are hoping for a change in behavior from what ive seen that would still be a hope
7387936 part of me thinks that maybe if the students are able to drink at a younger age it might not be such a fascination
7387937 the science and the research unequivocally shows us the 21 minimum drinking age has saved lives as well as reduced underage drinking and binge drinking
7387938 since the law has done little if anything to curtail irresponsible drinking on college campuses we believe that the question might there be a better solution is certainly worth asking as educators we have a responsibility to ask these kinds of questions even when they may be unpopular or controversial
7387939 central and southern luzon and visayas will experience mostly cloudy skies with scattered rain showers and thunderstorms the rest of the country will have partly cloudy to at times cloudy skies with isolated rain showers or thunderstorms mostly in the afternoon or evening

7387943 we have been amazed at our customers response as well as the positive media attention that skinlastin has received since its launch we know people are forever on the quest to look and feel younger so we were anticipating the product to do well but for it to become one of the most sought after beauty products on the market in such a short period of time is just phenomenal there are no other products on the market today that contain the right mixture of ingredients and can produce the profound results like skinlastin our clients are growing by the thousands daily we are now working hard to keep stock levels buoyant and therefore keep the smiles on our customers faces

7387961 we cant get rid of the president hes there for two and a half more years
7387962 there is a system of accountability when you make serious mistakes you step forward and you acknowledge them and you walk away
7387963 presidents cant and shouldnt do that secretaries of defense can and should
7387964 should be be gone he shouldnt be in his office tomorrow morning
7387965 a secretary of defense whose instinct and judgment we all trust
7387966 a direct link between haditha the national embarrassment of abu ghraib going on four years now of uncontrollable chaos in iraq with the bad judgment poor decisions of our secretary of defense back in late 2003 and 2004
7387967 we went in under resourced overcommitted and the strain on the force is unbelievable
7387968 its absolutely wrong in the face of haditha before you know whats gone on to call for the resignation of anybody
7387969 put this in perspective do you fire the police chief every time one of his officers does something wrong no
7387970 is allowing the chain of command to do what its supposed to do in the department of defense which is to complete an investigation
7387971 we could turn this country into chechnya we had enough people and equipment to do that or we had to do nothing and stay a modern european country

7388009 lets institute loan repayment program well make it available to doctors who are willing to work in areas we will designate as under served well offer huge sums of loan repayment money something like 20 000 who can resist that

7388016 the group consultation with its lenders has concluded that no proposal received to date provides acceptable outcome which is in the best interests of all relevant stakeholders
7388017 the group believes that in particular given current difficult capital market conditions an acceptable proposal capable of being implemented by 15 december 2008 is unlikely to be forthcoming
7388018 in the absence of a recapitalisation solution in the short term the groups objective therefore is to obtain longer term debt extensions from the lender groups beyond 15 december 2008 to provide a more stabilised environment for the recapitalisation process to be pursued over a longer time frame
7388019 the group has commenced discussions with the lender groups on possible terms for longer term debt extension and stabilisation of the group
7388020 it is likely that those terms would include a requirement for the conversion of a portion of debt into some form of hybrid security
7388021 this may impact the value of the groups existing ordinary equity

7388124 were always working to improve our products for our customers
7388125 to say im pleased with the results is an understatement we were hoping for prices of up to 40 per cent lower than the current benchmark achieving around 50 percent savings for the laptops is a phenomenal result this will really pave the way in helping our customers meet their savings targets
7388126 we have always been convinced of the potential for savings through collaboration and e auctions and are really pleased with these latest results the nine e auctions we have undertaken so far have realized total savings of 35 percent which equates to 33 3 million us 61 4 million saved overall
7388127 our testing has been concentrating on products that might have both of the claims present
7388128 we can confirm that both claims are valid in some of our products once we have completed testing and analysis of the alleged issues we will communicate the next steps we will also investigate potential measures to counter the risk of stealth installation
7388129 potentially hundreds of millions of dollars have been wasted delivery schedules have slipped contractor employees have been laid off
7388130 the end result is a current it system used to identify terrorist threats that has been crippled by technical flaws and a new system that if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system in operation today
7388131 were as aware as anybody that the market is competitive again
7388132 were getting close to the end of what you can do with an interpreter
7388133 it lets us focus our optimization energy on the parts of the program that matter most
7388134 we did that because we want to get wider feedback
7388135 were excited to bring unencumbered truly open source video to the web
7388136 were looking at doing that in the next two weeks
7388137 i mean to live my life an obedient man but obedient to god subservient to the wisdom of my ancestors never to the authority of political truths arrived at yesterday at the voting booth
7388138 bottom of handle is turned the razor head tip rises and tilts sideways
7388139 we think this conditionality that if individual families are in receipt of income support payments the regular attendance at school by their kids is a necessary precondition is the right way to go
7388140 we need in order to compete with the rest of the world to boost our current school retention rate from 75 per cent to 90 per cent by 2020 but we have real problems of school non attendance in indigenous communities and also school non attendance on the part of certain other kids as well
7388141 i mean it has a dreadful effect on children if they are only intermittently in school
7388142 all the research from around the world would tell us that if kids dont get a decent education then that is setting them up for a lifetime of failure we want to break that cycle
7388143 why punish the kids for their parents mistakes when you dont punish job seekers or so called job seekers who dont have a work ethic
7388144 now i really think kevin rudds got to be consistent on this and at the moment what were seeing i think are just populist gestures from a prime minister whos all spin and no substance
7388145 what theyve announced is another important step in ensuring that these parents its a small minority live up to their obligation to their children and obey the law
7388146 is there anybody around in the morning to help the child get to school
7388147 if there isnt and if the family for whatever reason is in a high degree of chaos then its unlikely that turning off the income tap to a degree for 12 weeks is going to make any difference in that regard
7388148 as far as were aware in the community sector there isnt really any evidence either in australia or from overseas that involuntary income management actually works on any dimension
7388149 its difficult to see how it is going to address the causes of the crisis and chaos in family lives that result in this kind of experience for children
7388150 so if theres an issue with the parenting lets wrap some parenting support programs around if theres alcohol other drugs violence if those things are an issue in the familys life in the adults life then lets try and go to the core of those issues
7388151 with all of these programs there is a strong evidence base for and we know they actually work we know they get results
7388152 the problem is out there in the community particularly in areas that are locationally disadvantaged is that those programs are simply not available to people
7388153 the parties will consider the feasibility of the chemical facility supplying the majority of arafuras chemical needs for its rare earth facility including hydrochloric and sulphuric acid and caustic soda
7388154 were also seeing the resources sector holding up despite a mixed bag of metal prices overnight
7388155 at this stage the market looks like it may remain relatively well bid by the end of the day but it wouldnt surprise me if we did see some profit taking later on
7388156 it isnt just a privacy issue it is a trespassing issue with their own photos as evidence
7388157 they really went off the track to get to our address
7388158 nothing you do ever goes away and nothing you do ever escapes notice
7388159 i mean to live my life an obedient man but obedient to god subservient to the wisdom of my ancestors never to the authority of political truths arrived at yesterday at the voting booth

7388177 it has been my observation that just one out of ten who start out in full time service for the lord at twenty one are still on track by the age of sixty five theyre shot down morally theyre shot down with discouragement theyre shot down with liberal theology they get obsessed with making money but for one reason or another nine out of ten fall out

7388185 the air bag inflated and pushed the head of jesus straight through her heart
7388186 if it wasnt for the plastic jesus ms fulps would still be alive today
7388187 air bags have saved thousands of lives but in this case it actually took a life thanks to jesus
7388188 it was just our daughters time to go and we cant question the actions of god my daughter loved jesus and worshipped him and i think shes probably talking to him in heaven right now
7388189 we gave our daughter the dashboard jesus for her birthday last year and she really liked it
7388190 its too bad that jesus ended up killing her but we believe shes in heaven now and were happy for her and hope to re unite with her when we get to heaven
7388191 surely you must believe in something you believe that were standing here having this conversation right then youre not an atheist
7388192 how can you know that god doesnt exist how can you truly claim to be an atheist
7388193 tinkerbell may not make it but we dont need her to we can make do without her we always have in reality

7388205 a growing number of companies are finding that lower visibility web oriented architecture woa developments spawned through grassroots movements are a better route to the service oriented architecture woa like soa is an architectural approach to system design though woa is resource oriented rather than service oriented whats the difference while the core soa design unit is a reusable service that fulfills a distinct business function resource oriented services are more limited and data focused
7388206 by going the woa plus rest route instead of soa plus soap the requirements for extending the application dropped considerably

7388222 if theres going to be tolling where they are paying then government should be looking at whether it can offset that by lower petrol prices

7388248 teachers still take a lot out of their pockets for things they think are important for the children
7388249 most of them do there are a lot of very caring teachers

7388323 our people will be thinking of that and what king would have thought of it as well does it really mean a post racial post civil rights america

7388325 i spend a lot of time trying to teach my children that in many respects their destiny is in their own hands i try to expose them to people and events that reinforce the idea that racial and social progress are generally the result of a lot of hard work and sacrifice by lots of people over a very long time baracks nomination stands as a milestone to the sacrifices of thousands of people who preceded us all in the struggle for equality and i wanted my children to see this process to make tangible the lessons ive been teaching them

7388329 the issue of discrimination and slavery has been about since the founding of the country
7388330 this is the beginning of the resolution of it historic is probably an understatement

7388339 you know dexter does terrible things but you also know he works by this code of ethics that requires him to only kill people who are killers themselves and are undeniably reprehensible
7388340 it lets the audience off the hook in feeling bad with the voiceover you feel youre in on the secret with dexter so youre implicated and youre injected with a sense of moral ambiguity
7388341 dexter takes responsibility for his dark side and uses it for good in some way everybody has a shadow side we all have our secrets and they are very powerful
7388342 to be honest i should be thankful but im a little bummed out i havent received any scary mail
7388343 when the show first came out people would come up to me and say they watched it and keep up the good work

7388366 after two days of negative publicity over its extrajudicial detention of ten tibet supporters the chinese government is seeking to suppress a story that would have cast a shadow over the closing ceremony of these olympic games
7388367 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7388368 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits

7388445 reading about the louisiana taxpayer party efforts to put the paul rockwell ticket on the ballot made me wonder who will be alexander hamilton to lews aaron burr
7388446 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
7388447 hey can i wrap you in bubble wrap and then use a needle to inject the bubbles with highlighter fluid
7388448 due to patriarchy every man has a ancient debt with women and hits in the testicles is the best way to pay off
7388449 sometimes the weaker storms that move very very slowly can be your biggest rainfall makers
7388450 it could have been a heck of a lot worse
7388451 we knew it was going to flood but we didnt know it was going to be this bad it was above my knees
7388452 i was just putting towels and comforters down to keep it out of the house but it kept coming
7388453 i said im not going to cry because if i start i wont stop
7388454 on sest bien entendu mais on a laiss peu de temps nos mamans pour discuter b tons rompus ca ce sera pour une prochaine fois londres paris ou ailleurs
7388455 i felt like my inner self like my brain itself was itching
7388456 i would try to control it during the day when i was aware of the itch but it was really hard
7388457 at night it was the worst i guess i would scratch when i was asleep because in the morning there would be blood on my pillowcase
7388458 scratching is one of the sweetest gratifications of nature and as ready at hand as any
7388459 the burning rage of fierce itching that nothing could relieve
7388460 as a child when you walked down the street did you count the lines did you do anything repetitive did you have to count everything you saw
7388461 this very bright and happy looking woman standing by my bed
7388462 i thought oh great here we go again but she explained that she was a neurologist and she said the first thing i want to say to you is that i dont think youre crazy i dont think you have o c d at that moment i really saw her grow wings and a halo
7388463 i remember standing in a hallway talking to her and what she complained about her major concern was that she was tormented by this terrible itch over the eye where she had had shingles
7388464 the itch was so severe she had scratched off her eyebrow
7388465 every bedtime it looked like they were dressing me up for halloween me and the guy next to me
7388466 every night they would wrap up his hands and wrap up mine
7388467 but i heard he ended up dying from it because he scratched into his carotid artery
7388468 but i have a fantasy of shaving off my eyebrow and taking a metal wire grill brush and scratching away
7388469 light and colours heat and cold extension and figures in a word the things we see and feel what are they but so many sensations notions ideas
7388470 i was raking leaves out in the yard and all of a sudden there was an explosion of pain and my left arm wasnt responding to my brain
7388471 sometimes i feel that my skin has been flayed and my flesh is exposed and any touch is just very painful
7388472 sometimes i feel that theres an ice pick or a wasp sting sometimes i feel that ive been splattered with hot cooking oil
7388473 i find i am choosing itch relief over the pain that i am provoking by satisfying the itch
7388474 whats most dramatic is the change in the size of my hand
7388475 now suppose she looks in this mirror and scratches the left side of her head no thinking out loud here suppose she looks and you have someone else touch the left side of her head itll look maybe itll feel like youre touching the right side of her head
7388476 maybe this would make her itchy right scalp feel more normal
7388477 omg lulu is stupid why didnt he just blow up the exit outside and not trap himself in there
7388478 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
7388479 the soviet car took second place while the american car came in next to last
7388480 man that chic likes comics and silvia and striped socks and i want to meet her
7388481 coopers appears to have taken the more challenging and ultimately environmentally responsible route of greening the whole company if coopers meets worlds best practice for water and energy use in producing beer this could in fact be greener than the other beers that buy their way to greenness through carbon offsets admirably coopers generates its own electricity onsite has water recycling facilities and avoids additives and preservatives
7388482 the trouble is coopers doesnt provide the reassurance of third party certification or support its claims with much evidence when we asked coopers couldnt confirm what worlds best practice is nor could it provide comparable data on how it was performing in relation to other beer manufacturers in australia
7388483 the company also told us its just now in the process of measuring their footprint months after we first spotted its footprint advert
7388484 greenwash needs to be eradicated because what we buy today has consequences for the environment and what we leave future generations its not just about a short term purchasing contract between producer and consumer
7388485 we are supporting a three pronged approach vigorous australian competition and consumer commission accc action including protection of core words like green and environment friendly from misrepresentation a strong advertising industry code and upskilling of the marketers and advertisers to recognise greenwash and stop it at source
7388486 we dont want to scare producers from developing green products and advertisers telling people about their benefits we want producers to regain credibility and advertisers to help make green products the normal purchase for people
7388487 tec will continue to use all three approaches making complaints to the accc where necessary helping the industry to get an effective code and providing advice on how to avoid greenwash our green cred checklist is part of that process
7388488 the catholic and the communist are alike in assuming that an opponent cannot be both honest and intelligent
7388489 the opinions that are held with passion are always those for which no good ground exists indeed the passion is the measure of the holders lack of rational conviction
7388490 everybody knows men in the northeast beat up their women
7388491 i am afraid to read it in case it makes me think that i have been wrong all these years
7388492 does neil lyndon really imagine that we are all going to say that we were wrong about feminism and think again
7388493 what i hope most of all is that people will not read this book
7388494 the best reason to belong to the left is that you meet the nicest people there
7388495 the star of his year both intellectually and personally one of those comparatively few pupils whom many teachers will always remember
7388496 how hopelessly naive i must have been to expect that the 1960s and 1970s generation of leftists of whom i was one might think again and admit the possibility that they we might have been mistaken the beautiful people of the 1960s the generation of love and revolution do not have it in them to admit error about anything at all least of all feminism if they were mistaken about feminism somebody might see that they actually have been wrong about everything
7388497 viu s como eu o enganei eu disse que estou indo para manhua u para ele pensar que vou para manhumirim mas na verdade vou mesmo para manhua u
7388498 they will support improved management of personnel safety traffic management collision avoidance and the improved efficiency of haul truck operations at mine sites
7388499 they will also help develop workforce management systems to provide increased security for workers in remote areas such as queenslands outback and piemontes alpine regions in italy
7388500 simone speaks with a very sexy accent i think she is spanish lol
7388501 it was nice to get out there and get some runs today gayle said
7388502 the plan was to bat as long as possible without putting any pressure on myself the plan worked and i am obviously pleased
7388503 i do think canada can get to the top 12 in 2012 but its going to take a big effort i do think there is a need for more investment
7388504 there were a number of events out there where we got a silver and i thought dammit just short of the gold
7388505 our ultimate objective at some time has to be how many gold medals will we win were certainly talking about that a lot more
7388506 we would appeal to prime minister stephen harper to give us the extra 6 million dollars wed asked for in the last budget
7388507 wed asked for 30 million lets look at the extra 50 or 60 million were going to need over the next few years to try and build the kinds of programs theyve got in britain and australia and the united states
7388508 if were going to play with the big boys if were going to be a g8 nation lets be g8 at all levels
7388509 canadas athletes rose to the occasion providing exciting and memorable moments which included personal bests and new national records
7388510 canadians watched your outstanding performances with great pride and excitement and we salute you
7388511 today i like all canadian sports fans am looking back with pride at the many memorable performances of our fellow canadians at the 2008 olympic games
7388512 its definitely hard to compete with the top countries especially when you look at diving trampoline and gymnastics
7388513 it was so difficult to compete against the chinese athletes here and the programs they have in place are just amazing
7388514 funding has to come early enough that theres time for the athletes to prepare and have access to everything they need and the support they need to compete with the top countries in the world were already seeing small improvements and hopefully its going to continue that way
7388515 we made a decision some time ago to start targeting the money and we realized we couldnt be a mile wide and an inch deep
7388516 australia targets the sports where they know they can get medals
7388517 im not sure we can ever be as targeted as that and i dont think canadians would accept that we have a certain egalitarian nature that is going to demand that every kid gets a chance but we can target more than we have in the past
7388518 the more you see of these tremendous young people the more you want to see of them but if you dont see them and you dont know who they are there isnt that passion to watch them
7388519 its tough enough in the ups and downs of the olympics world its another game in the ups and downs of the political world
7388520 athletes are training to perform in the sports world we would be very careful how they might be used in the political field
7388521 oh my god have you ever read the synopses of the saw movies theyre horrible
7388522 because i know i can never see them but i thought i should know what they were about but this is even worse i cant stop reading them and now i have to worry about saw fans it upsets me that saw fans walk among us and i cant spot them on the street
7388523 the russians are definitely putting the biggest effort into the north
7388524 they built it up more theyre further ahead on resource development and they also have the largest ice breaking fleet
7388525 theyre ahead of the game on the submissions for the law of the sea
7388526 the longer they stay out the longer the russians are able to consolidate their position to their advantage
7388527 nuns are a bit excluded they are a bit marginalized in ecclesiastical life
7388528 this will be an occasion to make their contribution more visible
7388529 the russians are definitely putting the biggest effort into the north
7388530 they built it up more theyre further ahead on resource development and they also have the largest ice breaking fleet

7388551 the most important thing a department chair does is faculty recruiting and faculty retention
7388552 he did that wonderfully well in a period when the university was undergoing a period of retrenchment financially he managed to improve the national ranking of the department
7388553 he did a very good job of keeping them once they came
7388554 what that mostly requires is preserving harmony a lot of departments just kind of blow up and explode because people get angry with each other and some of them storm off and leave the department a wreck he managed to make sure that contentious issues didnt become prominent in the department
7388555 was a very clear thinker he was very careful his lectures were extremely clear and well thought through
7388556 he would go downtown twice a week to listen to jazz
7388557 there are a lot of pieces coming together at the same time
7388558 while that is daunting and frightening in some regards it represents an opportunity to freshen the view and the conversation and solutions that might be required
7388559 whenever you lose top leadership like that you lose a certain amount of institutional memory
7388560 it certainly has changed from a school where 99 percent were white that was 15 years ago to a school with a wonderful blend of ethnicities and races
7388561 teachers are so used to huge changes because we get new kids and new parents every year
7388562 we dont really have confession so you dont have to tell me
7388563 the plants are trying to kill themselves and us by sequestering co2

7388570 we have a new character known simply as wyatt who is the company guy who is trying to track them this year
7388571 another new character is a hacker named roland our team has learned to have some level of trust among each other or at least they know everyone elses agenda but this is a new guy theyre forced to work with and theyre not sure how they feel about him but they need his expertise in the technological stuff that our guys dont necessarily have
7388572 we do learn a little bit this season why michael scofield is so smart this is not sci fi but there is something that is unique about his childhood that leads to why he has the ability to do some of things he can do
7388573 are finally together but like i said there have always been these physical barriers between them he was incarcerated she worked in the prison hospital so obviously theres a barrier he was on the run she was in another part of the country theres a barrier here they are finally able to be together but we are jumping ahead in time so theres that period thats unaccounted for so what happened to her what happened to him and hope they both help each other get past that get past these invisible barriers theres no physical barriers anymore between them but theyre both pretty banged up when they see each other and its about how they get past that to really find that real intimacy theyre all still trying to clear their names avoid jail time avoid death and so theres still that locomotive feel to it storytelling wise and while thats going on on on the fly these two people are trying to save each other
7388574 a bohemian libertine who drank heavily and loved jazz he became friends with stanley dunham mr obamas maternal grandfather in the 1960s mr davis died in 1987 at the age of 81 five years before mr dunham
7388575 theyd play scrabble and drink and crack jokes and crack jokes and argue frank always won and he was always very braggadocio about it too it was all jocular they didnt get polluted drunk and frank never really did drugs though he and stan would smoke pot together
7388576 stan had been promising to bring barry by because we all had that in common franks kids were half white stans grandson was half black and my son was half black we all had that in common and we all really enjoyed it we got a real kick out of reality
7388577 leaving your race at the door leaving your people behind understand something boy youre not going to college to get educated youre going there to get trained
7388578 theyll tank on your chain and let you know that you may be a well trained well paid nigger but youre a nigger just the same
7388579 i could not then truthfully deny that this book which came out in 1968 as a greenleaf classic was mine
7388580 changed names and identities all incidents i have described have been taken from actual experiences
7388581 i have often wished i had two penises to enjoy simultaneously the double but different sensations of oral and genital copulation
7388582 im not one to go in for lolitas usually id rather not bed a babe under 20 but there are exceptions i didnt want to disappoint the trusting child at her still impressionistic age a rejection might be traumatic could even cripple her sexually for life
7388583 anne came up many times the next several weeks her aunt thinking she was in good hands actually she was she obtained a course in practical sex from experienced and considerate practitioners rather than from ignorant insensitive neophytes i think we did her a favor although the pleasure was mutual
7388584 the less threatened people feel the more tolerant they are
7388585 in the old days i would have told you to work hard and save your money
7388586 its different today i just havent nailed it down yet
7388587 we have kids in the minor leagues by the names of bobby parnell and jonathon niese we have brian stokes we have other guys we like that weve used in the past
7388588 the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race
7388589 meanwhile bush usa tbilisi iraq and other places russia and iran arent
7388590 hes an outstanding leader and somebody who would better represent the mainstream of the country
7388591 the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race

7388594 turns the tongue into a joystick of sorts allowing the disabled to manipulate wheelchairs manage home appliances and control computers
7388595 women should not be seen in public running or training
7388596 i know its dangerous for a woman to run in public to compete and i dont know whether when i go back whether there will be more people for me or more people against me for what i did but even if just 20 percent support me thats good enough
7388597 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7388598 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7388599 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7388600 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7388601 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7388602 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7388603 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7388604 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7388605 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7388606 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7388607 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7388608 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7388609 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7388610 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

7388616 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7388617 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7388618 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7388619 forgiveness is not holding a person accountable for what they have done to you
7388620 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7388621 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7388622 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7388623 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

7388728 the infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to moralists that is why they invented hell
7388729 just as nightfall does not come at once neither does oppression in both instances there is a twilight and it is in such a twilight that we all must be aware of change in the air however slight lest we become unwilling victims of the darkness
7388730 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
7388731 you know a long time ago being crazy meant something nowadays everybodys crazy
7388732 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack upon ones convictions
7388733 i have examined all the known superstitions of the world and i do not find in our particular superstition of christianity one redeeming feature they are all alike founded on fables and mythology millions of innocent men women and children since the introduction of christianity have been burnt tortured fined and imprisoned what has been the effect of this coercion to make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites to support roguery and error all over the earth
7388734 a human being is part of a whole called by us the universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
7388735 of all the enemies to public liberty war is perhaps the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other war is the parent of armies from these proceed debts and taxes and armies and debts and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few in war too the discretionary power of the executive is extended its influence in dealing out offices honors and emoluments is multiplied and all the means of seducing the minds are added to those of subduing the force of the people the same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes and the opportunities of fraud growing out of a state of war and in the degeneracy of manners and morals engendered by both no nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare
7388736 in the end the party would announce that 2 plus 2 made 5 and you would have to believe it it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later the logic of their position demanded it
7388737 i do not believe in the creed professed by the jewish church by the roman church by the greek church by the turkish church by the protestant church nor by any church that i know of my own mind is my own church
7388738 all national institutions of churches whether jewish christian or turkish appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind and monopolize power and profit
7388739 i do not mean by this declaration to condemn those who believe otherwise they have the same right to their belief as i have to mine but it is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to himself infidelity does not consist in believing or in disbelieving it consists in professing to believe what he does not believe
7388740 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
7388741 let your boat of life be light packed with only what you need a homely home and simple pleasure one or two friends worth the name someone to love and someone to love you a cat a dog and a pipe or two enough to eat and enough to wear and a little more than enough to drink for thirst is a dangerous thing
7388742 we are all born ignorant but one must work hard to remain stupid
7388743 a thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity stability and beauty of the biotic community it is wrong when it tends otherwise
7388744 living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do
7388745 the founders of our nation were nearly all infidels and that of the presidents who had thus far been elected washington adams jefferson madison monroe adams jackson not a one had professed a belief in christianity
7388746 among all our presidents from washington downward not one was a professor of religion at least not of more than unitarianism
7388747 undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level
7388748 there are plenty of good reasons for fighting but no good reason ever to hate without reservation to imagine that god almighty himself hates with you too wheres evil its that large part of every man that wants to hate without limit that wants to hate with god on its side its that part of every man that finds all kinds of ugliness so attractive its that part of an imbecile that punishes and vilifies and makes war gladly

7388763 the group consultation with its lenders has concluded that no proposal received to date provides acceptable outcome which is in the best interests of all relevant stakeholders it said
7388764 the group believes that in particular given current difficult capital market conditions an acceptable proposal capable of being implemented by 15 december 2008 is unlikely to be forthcoming
7388765 in the absence of a recapitalisation solution in the short term the groups objective therefore is to obtain longer term debt extensions from the lender groups beyond 15 december 2008 to provide a more stabilised environment for the recapitalisation process to be pursued over a longer time frame it said
7388766 the group has commenced discussions with the lender groups on possible terms for longer term debt extension and stabilisation of the group
7388767 it is likely that those terms would include a requirement for the conversion of a portion of debt into some form of hybrid security
7388768 this may impact the value of the groups existing ordinary equity
7388769 our fifth annual talent lab is delighted to open its doors to an outstanding group of talented emerging filmmakers

7388771 just me after work or on weekends at home just mucking around with instruments and stuff
7388772 when i first approached sony or they approached me or whatever a year or so ago i had the album finished
7388773 it was done but i think that they liked the whole thing you know the art and the band and the music everything i think theyve trusted me to keep going with that like oh youre going down a good path just keep going with that keep being artistic give it your own artistic direction and well support you in stuff
7388774 i havent been able to go food shopping for weeks eh im getting a little bit slack im not really home much
7388775 i dont really feel very satisfied if im not doing something or outputting or have something to show thats why ive always had a studio in my house thats what i really like about music i can just press record and ive got something to show for it straight away
7388776 oh i dont mind but i do actually only use the kazoo in one song something in your eyes and its only doubling the whistle its actually quite subtle
7388777 i really like eclectic music eh but i think the album is already eclectic enough cos nothing was recorded at the same time in the same room doing it the same way every song is actually constructed completely independently from the other one
7388778 thats a perfect example of what a record company can do for you with their initiative they bought a box of kazoos and put stickers on it
7388779 you know the funny thing is ive been working on this sanitarium ad for these light and tasty cornflakes theyve got manuka honey on them
7388780 so ive been doing this light and tasty ad and its got a bumble bee flying around and theres a shadow of a bee flying around in the background and i was putting bee sounds in and the client comes round and says no it sounds like a fly thats really gross so do you know what the solution was
7388781 to make it sound more cartoony which is why im a little bit late cos he kept hassling me about it hes like have you done the kazoo yet
7388782 so i was like thats real lucky that i just happened to have the kazoo in my bag

7388794 mike tilley came to challenger with a clear mandate he has fulfilled that mandate and the board has been considering the right structure for the next phase of the companys development challenger financial chairman peter polson said
7388795 mike has developed a strong senior team and there was no question about succession
7388796 the board looks forward to working closely with dominic during the next phase of the companys development
7388797 this is a very credible result despite the adversity in the market over the last 12 months mr tilley said in a statement
7388798 that we were able to generate a 21 per cent increase in normalised ebit in such conditions is a reflection of the strength of our diversified financial services business
7388799 we believe that the current difficult market conditions will continue to affect the sector for some time to come mr stevens said
7388800 the strategies we have put in place have put us in a very good position in terms of liquidity and capital providing some insulation from the difficulties of the current environment
7388801 together with an intense focus on risk management we are very well placed to manage our way through the cycle and take advantage of opportunities created by the current environment he added
7388802 we remain confident in our pursuit of generating double digit eps growth in the long term
7388803 dominic and i have worked very closely together over the past four years and i have every confidence that he will be an outstanding chief executive mr tilley said

7388822 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7388823 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7388824 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7388825 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7388826 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7388827 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7388828 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7388829 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7388830 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7388831 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7388832 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7388833 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7388834 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7388835 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7388836 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7388837 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7388838 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7388839 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7388840 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7388841 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7388842 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7388843 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7388844 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7388845 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7388846 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7388847 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7388848 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7388849 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7388850 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7388851 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7388852 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7388853 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7388854 thats what happens when you get all that hot air democratic national conventioners all in one place

7388864 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7388865 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7388866 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7388867 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7388868 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7388869 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7388870 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7388871 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7388872 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7388873 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7388874 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7388875 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7388876 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7388877 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7388878 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7388879 austereo is uniquely placed through its current leading ratings and sales share to capitalise on future advertising market uplift chief executive michael anderson said
7388880 in tighter economic conditions radio outperformed total metropolitan media in part due to its flexibility cost efficiency and targeted audience reach he said
7388881 for the july to december 2008 half we believe that capital city radio growth will be in positive territory in a range below three per cent he said
7388882 in the past year combined radio and online advertising campaigns have almost doubled he said

7388928 last year at the all city competition he kexin moved from one team to another and during the process of registering during the move there appeared this age discrepancy
7388929 so it was the appearance of a mistake in the process of transferring teams that the misunderstanding appeared however i can right here accurately say that the ages of the members of our gymnastics delegation entirely conform to the requirements for participation in the beijing olympic games

7388939 the company sees little improvement in the underlying earnings in fiscal 2009 due to uncertainty around commodity costs and future economic conditions in australia and new zealand goodman fielder said
7388940 the company is more optimistic for the fiscal 2010 year and expects to see the benefits flow through from significant capital expenditure and resulting efficiency gains combined with softening commodity prices
7388941 substantial and rapid increases in commodity costs impacted margins and added 204 million to its costs
7388942 in the second half of the year international crude oil pricing also reached record high levels resulting in an increase of 30 million in logistics costs it added
7388943 a rapid deterioration in the new zealand economy towards the end of the financial year also impacted earnings as did the weakening new zealand dollar
7388944 this was the first time in the last five years in which the business did not record double digit profit growth goodman said
7388945 the dairy business had a difficult year with rapidly escalating commodity costs resulting in raw milk costs increasing by over 60 per cent in the year goodman said
7388946 aggressive cost recovery initiatives resulted in the business taking four price rises but inevitable timing lags and a growth in private label sales had a negative impact on margins
7388947 hey you have more of this fabric dont you well yah but its so popular i dont want to pull any i dont have to so im sitting here with a surgical scalpel ripping seams while watching young frankenstein
7388948 to the future or to the past to a time when thought is free to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone from the age of uniformity from the age of solitude from the age of big brother from the age of doublethink greetings
7388949 underlying eps earnings per share grew strongly by 12 5 per cent and we are confident this performance provides a clear path for delivering improved results in full year 2009 and beyond chief executive jo farnik said
7388950 following the completion of our strategic review and the identification of opportunities for growth and improved efficiency we undertook deliberate investment in restructuring and this has and will continue to deliver strong financial returns mr farnik said
7388951 the yuma proving ground in arizona was an appropriate setting for zephyrs world beating flight as many landmark aviation developments have taken place there in recent years in addition to setting a new unofficial record the trial is a step towards the delivery of zephyrs capability for joint real time battlefield persistent surveillance and communications to forces in the field at the earliest opportunity
7388952 mod is very pleased with the success of the recent trial which demonstrated the potential capability of the technologies in zephyr this success has also reinforced the close working relationship between the uk and us on these key technologies
7388953 i am grateful for the fact that i have a wonderful life
7388954 i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what its like to be blessed by the opportunities of this great nation
7388955 emphasis mine couric asked about mccains answer when politico inquired about the number of homes he and his wife cindy
7388956 we didnt have a great game last saturday at unc wilmington
7388957 so i think the girls were very very anxious to get out and kind of play better and take it to a different level than we did last saturday we did that but it comes down to finishing we did a great job of finishing
7388958 we had four players who scored their first career goals at duke
7388959 we scored a couple of goals on set plays which is something that is always a bonus we havent been as sharp over the last couple of years as i have wanted to in that area that was great carla overbeck said it best at halftime when she talked to the team the good thing about it is we scored different ways and different players scored we scored on long distance shots set plays scored on combinations and beating players we had a lot of variety in our attack
7388960 i am not used to scoring goals so i was excited i wanted to make sure it went in right when i thought it did and it had so i was excited
7388961 last season i was injured for most of the season
7388962 i am really happy i had surgery in the offseason and i am happy with how my ankle has progressed
7388963 i think this team is going to have more firepower than the teams have had in the past
7388964 we have different combinations but we are still searching for our combinations it was a good job i was proud we are obviously a better team than they are we have better players but we played better we played good soccer for most of the 90 minutes i am very happy it was a good start but we have a long ways to go
7388965 we are a lot stronger than we were last year
7388966 we have that goal scoring mentality and obviously this wasnt the toughest test we will have but i think we will be able to bring it in games down the road
7388967 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7388968 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7388969 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7388970 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7388971 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7388972 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily
7388973 you could have full control over your environment by just being able to move your tongue
7388974 this could give you an almost infinite number of switches and options for communication
7388975 left up could be turning lights on right down could be turning off the tv
7388976 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping our food safe with the standards that go well beyond regulatory requirements
7388977 but this week our best efforts failed and for that we are deeply sorry
7388978 he could be out for 10 days or as much as two weeks we are just waiting to see what type of a healer hes going to be
7388979 if we have the choice of having him for one game or 15 well take the 15
7388980 i think we were very soft in our pass protection in our run game we had a lack of sustaining one on one blocks on the first four passes that jason threw he had somebody walked back into him or he had somebody in his face it is very difficult to play qb from that position they played very aggressive football and we didnt match that intensity
7388981 for both teams because it was a chance to see what the starters could do for a longer period of time and we didnt do anything
7388982 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7388983 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7388984 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7388985 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7388986 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7388987 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7388988 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure
7388989 we need somebody who talks tough whos going to act smart and be tough thats how were going to look after the safety of the american people
7388990 i dont think hes ready to be president and when youre commander in chief you shouldnt be having to select a mentor to help you with that role
7388991 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7388992 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7388993 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7388994 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7388995 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7388996 this man is suspected of being involved in one of the most heinous mass killings in recent times
7388997 you are always concerned any time a player like that goes down
7388998 thats not good we know the type of player he is and if he can come back he will but we have the personnel to step up in his absence
7388999 unfortunately they were called back i think all we have to do is watch the film to see we have a lot of potential
7389000 in this case it would be easily justifiable to say for me to play a series if not there are a lot of things we can learn from the film
7389001 we need to make a few more plays we just need to work on our third down conversions and find a way to put more points on the board
7389002 any time you have 12 penalties and 10 of them are on offensive plays thats an issue
7389003 it was really amazing there were kids swimming out to see us and boats sailing out to meet us
7389004 it took us a day and a half to get here and most of the activists got seasick but the people here were so happy when we arrived
7389005 they came they were welcomed but what will they do tomorrow they were hoping for a long confrontation with israel now they wont have it
7389006 now that weve come through whats the excuse to keep the third boat out or the 10th boat or the 100th we did break the economic siege of gaza
7389007 we were concentrating more on the flight than the record
7389008 hmm next week is labor day and theres francines party on the twenty thi oh shit
7389009 scotlands sunday herald newspaper has an exclusive report that the
7389010 enough data there to spark a major european crime wave
7389011 enough data there to spark a major european crime wave
7389012 planted a trojan virus on one of the continental best western hotel machines used for reservations
7389013 the privacy of our guests is our number one concern
7389014 what of the risk to microsofts own customers from continuing to use microsofts demonstratively more insecure products
7389015 its just unfortunate i guess that this sort of momentous occasion i guess should happen on the same day that our colleague is to have his memorial service
7389016 i guess the joy i suppose is tempered a little bit by the fact that were all very very deeply feeling for ben
7389017 whether there is any omen in it or whatever that should happen on the same day as his memorial service i know thats what ben would want for everything to be getting on and happening again
7389018 ppi cotherapy is cost effective by traditional standards in patients taking long term low dose aspirin for secondary prevention provided that the ppi is available at otc prices
7389019 at prescription prices cotherapy is cost effective only in high risk and elderly patients
7389020 until better evidence is available physicians and their patients should use ppi medications to prevent recurrent bleeding in patients with previous ugib but physicians should not prescribe them routinely for patients at average risk
7389021 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time mr bounds said in a statement reported by fox news
7389022 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7389023 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time mr bounds said in a statement reported by fox news news com au is not responsible for the content of external sites hollywoods hot rice dish
7389024 warts and all securities lending review has glossed over one large ugly carbuncle the bank may yet bail out the stock lender and broker tricom
7389025 ring fencing tricoms 81 million loan book and now anz is once again exposed to the losses
7389026 we are continuing to support our customer was all the bank would say this morning
7389027 no comment was the official line when asked if anz would stump up cash to bail out tricom anz already owns 11 5 of tricom as does babcock amp brown after the two struck a band aid rescue deal this year
7389028 new broom at anz ceo mike smith can hardly blame his predecessor john macfarlane any more
7389029 the gravity of the issues relating to the equity finance business should have been but was not properly brought to the attention of the chief executive of the board smacks of buck passing of the highest order
7389030 ring fencing of the loan book and the general state of financial markets this means there is no agreement on who has liability for the debts in the loan book
7389031 we have issues and we are trying to deal with them he said yesterday
7389032 we are still working on achieving our mutual objectives whatever hurdles are there we will try to get over them
7389033 look for the fed and paulson to take steps on fannie and freddie the time is ripe the market wants resolution here
7389034 there are a lot of cross currents here youve got oil financials and politics coming together and its hard to see that combining in a way thats a perfect storm to the downside or a perfect environment to the upside
7389035 i think its important that the week ahead is the last week in august and so whatever happens we should take it with a grain of salt
7389036 what weve been saying about housing is just show us some stability were looking for a silver lining
7389037 lho acquistata ad inizio di luglio 2007 in due mesi ho persorso 8 000 km tanto di cappello al motore che non finisce pi ha 141 cv con una coppia notevole nonostante il suo peso di 18 quintali
7389038 hi how is everybody doing today i am tommy and this is sheri
7389039 we have got about 12 to 14 properties we are going to see today we are going to try to keep moving very quickly
7389040 i had no idea that in such a nice location i could get a house for a price that is half of what it was just three years back
7389041 a lot of these foreclosures dont even have signs up saying that they are foreclosures and they are gone in a day
7389042 so its difficult to find them and when we do its hard to work with the banks to get our contracts approved so we decided that if it was that hard for us to do how hard it was for everybody else to do it
7389043 they make it very organized and its kind of fun you know to go on the buses to see all the properties
7389044 it does save me a lot of time instead of actually contacting all the agents to go through these properties
7389045 if you put it into a light where you look at this house and you say somebody used to live there and they lost their home and they lost everything its really hard
7389046 but we want to make it an enjoyable experience and fun and a great opportunity for new people to have a home themselves that maybe couldnt afford a home three years ago
7389047 the plan is still to bring senator kennedy in for a short period of time it would be an in and out appearance the source was quoted as saying
7389048 imagine what would happen at the instant that video fades to black the lights in the hall come up and who is standing there center stage but ted himself the living heart and soul of this party mr goldman said
7389049 even if he didnt say a word the place would go absolutely nuts
7389050 we lost our son jeffery in iraq in 2004 he was a second lieutenant so we certainly can connect with all the people that are out here
7389051 i tell people often we are in a club that we never wanted to be in there are a group of us that never wanted to be a group because of this reason but we are
7389052 it shows the comradery and respect that we have for the soldiers the have lost their lives to keep the rest of us safe
7389053 we are thinking about our son all the time but just to know that this many people took time out to be with us means everything
7389054 never mind what people say if i want to change the policy because i think i have to i will change it
7389055 i dont care what the opposition says i will do it thats me
7389056 if there is further reduction the government will announce an adjustment every 15 days based on global crude oil price
7389057 we cant do anything about only the market can fix the problem
7389058 that displaying carbon footprints will raise awareness among consumers as well as companies of their emissions and motivate them to emit less c02
7389059 he ministry claims to have already completed research that shows that a bag of crisps emits 75 grams 2 63 ounces of carbon dioxide throughout its lifecyle
7389060 currently there are six working people supporting one person in retirement
7389061 in a few years time three persons will have to support one person so you are moving into an era where you will have rising healthcare costs because the population is ageing
7389062 there is a rising pension cost for the government because more people are retiring
7389063 basically dont expect the government to take care of you this generation has lived beyond their needs and you will have to pay the price
7389064 so in 20 25 years the government wont have money to pay they will inflate the pensions away so that the purchasing value of the pension will get less and less
7389065 the ability to provide universal healthcare will also reduce there will be less economic out put and less people to tax
7389066 rebate value will not exceed purchase price under any circumstances
7389067 the war had left a population bereft of resources in the uk while america ruminated on the birth of consumerism rumblings of discontent were heard the world over but it was perhaps in great britain that the most visually beguiling teenage cult of all time was to be born the teddy boy
7389068 its risen a little bit but its not too bad over the last couple of days its risen steadily to 15m
7389069 i wouldnt expect it to go much higher than it is at the moment the forecast is a bit more favourable for the next few days
7389070 yesterday we did have some flooding but theyre both receding
7389071 it was great the car was stable and straight as an arrow
7389072 before they showed me the timing i thought wed gone about 135mph 217km h
7389073 theres no perception of speed when youre out there except for the mile markers
7389074 if we havent seen something before it must be pretty rare
7389075 this is a remarkably significant deal for us because what it does is change the world for us
7389076 we were once a spectator in the process we are now truly a partner of the crown in relation to the protection and restoration of our ancestral river waikato we are hugely excited about that
7389077 it is said that around every bend in the mighty waikato a taniwha can be found
7389078 in the three years of this negotiating process i think we can all agree that we found every single one
7389079 with this agreement the crown is showing waikato tainui that we are committed to restoring the health of the waikato river and to a clean up process that will be one of the most important environmental undertakings in new zealands history
7389080 well what happened was i kind of ran into him
7389081 the popular enjoyment of practically unrestricted economic opportunities is precisely the condition which makes for individual bondage
7389082 groping progress from a disorganized and decentralized form of laissez faire individualism to an organized and socialized form of disciplined nationhood the movement would succeed once the virtues of pioneering independence were superseded by the virtues of social solidarity
7389083 the proper implementation of such legislation has in turn resulted in greater transparency and accountability while reducing the level of corruption in these countries
7389084 however the people can exercise their sovereignty effectively only if they are well informed
7389085 my experience is that in most democracies misinformation and disinformation has become a fine art and any one in control of the popular media can come into power
7389086 only an informed public can take the right decisions whether at elections or referenda
7389087 it is therefore imperative for good governance that the public has access to accurate complete and timely information so vital for its decisions
7389088 therefore some legislative mechanism to give members of the public access to information is badly needed in our country
7389089 it is the failure on the part of an increasingly greater number of public officers to adhere to principles of good governance that resulted in unfortunate decisions such as the recent judgement of the supreme court
7389090 to me this is a dedication day for my son he would have wanted people to come out and have a good time
7389091 hes ok he was really young when this happened i dont think hes grasping the idea he does still ask for his daddy i tell him hes in heaven
7389092 many of these bikers didnt know lee personally in fact theyve come here from as far away as australia their purpose is to help the family keep this case in the public eye
7389093 i want someone to think back to that day and realize that somebody was acting a little crazy or maybe nervous
7389094 man i dont care if she has her vagina filled in with cement
7389095 i would throw a hurtin on kelly bundy in a milisecond
7389096 my attraction to her has transcended the realm of the physical
7389097 i obviously dont care what he or anyone else thinks i would tax that shit now more than ever she deserves it and i wouldnt avoid the breastal area either i wouldnt make her leave the stuffed bra on or nothin id be lickin those nipple stumps homeboy after all shes done for me i want her to feel like shes beautiful
7389098 the tibetan culture has been massacred by the oppressive chinese government
7389099 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
7389100 major general jalandar shah commander of the zafar corp and major abdul jabar commander of a commando battalion were dismissed for neglecting their duties and concealing the facts of huge civilian casualties the statement said
7389101 you can take the hardest rock band on the earth and they sound like a bunch of girls next to the dubliners
7389102 ku pengen cari lagunya kuldesaknya ahmad dhani ada yang tau ga dimana vietnam
7389103 i messed up so its best for the team and im here for them
7389104 the expression of a fact as it appears within a certain sphere of thought you cannot convey a dogma by merely translating the words you must also understand the system of thought to which it is relevant
7389105 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas

7389110 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7389111 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7389112 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7389113 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7389114 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7389115 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7389116 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos
7389117 salvar la honra e imagen de mapuches buenos de nuestras comunidades
7389118 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
7389119 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7389120 perbedaan antara orang yang berzikir dengan yang tidak berzikir adalah seperti orang hidup dan orang yang mati
7389121 we have a lot of work to do not only to convince undecideds but also former hillary supporters

7389126 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7389127 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7389128 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7389129 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7389130 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7389131 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7389132 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7389133 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7389134 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7389135 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7389136 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7389140 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7389141 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7389142 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7389143 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7389144 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7389145 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7389146 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7389147 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7389148 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7389149 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7389150 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7389151 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7389152 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7389153 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7389154 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7389155 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7389156 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7389157 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7389158 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7389159 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7389160 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7389161 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7389162 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7389163 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7389164 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7389165 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7389166 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7389167 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7389168 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7389169 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7389170 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
7389171 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
7389172 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
7389173 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
7389174 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
7389175 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
7389176 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
7389177 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
7389178 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
7389179 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
7389180 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
7389181 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
7389182 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

7389225 la nataci n pura no ha conseguido resultados acordes el nuevo equipo directivo de la federaci n debe actuar de la mejor manera posible para cambiar la situaci n no ha habido una mejora en relaci n a atenas y s lo ha habido un finalista
7389226 por debajo en el n mero de medallas aunque no en finalistas
7389227 aqu hemos tenido 11 y en atenas hubo 10 no se le puede poner una buena nota y tampoco al judo un deporte tradicional de medalla
7389228 esto quiere decir que espa a tiene ese componente polideportivo y que en deportes minoritarios hemos dado un paso hacia adelante no se ha producido el salto cualitativo que pod a haberse dado
7389229 ha sobresalido como en baloncesto que han puesto nerviosos a los americanos
7389230 como decepciones es malo personalizar pero al salir siempre se piensa en medallas seguras ha habido n meros uno del mundo que no han ganado medalla pero son seres humanos y otras que se han escapado de las manos hay que lamentar que esos pron sticos no se hayan podido cumplir
7389231 es un caso como los dem s que se han dado en deportistas de otros pa ses
7389232 el esp ritu que ha tenido el equipo y el apoyo que se han dado todos los deportistas
7389233 el n mero de medallas con dos oros m s que en atenas quiere decir que el deporte espa ol ha progresado no es comparable el n mero de medallas ganadas en atenas a las logradas en pek n por la espectacular actuaci n que ha tenido china que ha hecho desplazarse a otros pa ses en el medallero

7389240 obviously it got out of control but to be honest i thought i was in a safe house
7389241 i thought i was part of a community that handled its problems internally and that recognized the dangers of exposing ourselves no pun intended to the rest of the country it is so difficult as a non participant to understand what is going on in the debate round

7389248 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life

7389267 las sensaciones son muy buenas y como digo hubo apariciones realmente fulgurantes
7389268 estoy trabajando para ser uno los convocados por el entrenador para el compromiso frente al n stic
7389269 y por supuesto que debutar con el tenerife en un partido oficial ser a un sue o hecho realidad
7389270 desde el principio me he encontrado c modo dentro del campo me he sentido ayudado y pienso que las cosas me salieron bien
7389271 yo creo que conocer ese planteamiento me motiv incluso m s
7389272 sab a que iba a estar m s complicado que lo que pensaba porque nos dijeron que a medida que fueran llegando los nuevos compa eros los jugadores del filial bamos a ir bajando
7389273 as me centr en trabajar todav a m s duro
7389274 estoy satisfecho de poder actuar en varias posiciones creo que desde el mediocentro ofensivo en adelante puedo jugar en cualquier demarcaci n y entiendo que eso me ayuda bastante
7389275 s que en todas las posiciones habr bastante competencia por ejemplo en las bandas con gente como iriome alfaro kome juanlu
7389276 de todas formas yo tambi n me sent muy bien cuando pude actuar pegado a un costado
7389277 al principio de la pretemporada tengo que reconocer que me notaba engarrotado pero con el transcurrir del tiempo los entrenamientos los partidos y la confianza que me dio el t cnico me fui sintiendo m s c modo
7389278 soy una persona reservada y lo m o si puedo es hablar dentro del campo
7389279 lo que m s me llama la atenci n es el ambiente que se respira en la caseta
7389280 se nota que todos los jugadores est n muy unidos buscando un mismo objetivo
7389281 recuerdo lo que sucedi la temporada pasada y fue algo que busqu yo

7389291 i got a call from a concerned delegate soon after
7389292 we had just done four months of negotiation on a collective agreement
7389293 i thought about the idea of psychological tourism and taking people to sites that can really enhance the psychological concept that you are trying to impress at the time
7389294 the idea is to look at a smorgasbord of things that would be useful for you in a great learning environment and follow you for 12 months after that with periodic emails to see how you are going in terms of the goals you have set
7389295 i came back and my normal 30 minute walks in the morning started to become about not so much walking the dog or exercise but about quiet time in my head about walking meditation about breathing exercises
7389296 within an organisational context there is research to say that people who have high levels of wellbeing and happiness have higher supervisory ratings within their appraisal systems and they have greater levels of organisational citizenship and they receive higher incomes
7389297 first we want to have the local community embrace it then the national community and then the international community
7389298 we think this can be a way of further defining the features of the illawarra employment creation is important to us because we want to be part of a great and healthy community
7389299 on paper i would say that the numbers look pretty good
7389300 but what it needs now is to be looked at from a practical perspective by technology companies and power plant management to see how it stacks up
7389301 because of the urgency of the environmental situation we have to do something now
7389302 this is not a long term solution but it could buy us 20 years or so to investigate new technologies
7389303 i think to some degree ive become a shorthand or a symbol or a stand in for now

7389326 if the wholesale price is determined by the big oil companies and they also control many of the outlets its not a level playing field for those small operators those independent operators in the retail sector

7389328 central to our concerns is the fact that the proposal forces retail prices to be locked in for a 24 hour period

7389357 in the past weve said a bit naively that if we cater for the needs of plants well just cross our fingers and hope that the needs of animals have been met as well

7389367 she was a warm caring mother shes being described as a taliban mother because of the way she dresses
7389368 the state prosecutors office and the police put words in the childrens mouths to incriminate their mother
7389369 this is a witch hunt they took the kids who had never in their lives been questioned by police and interrogated them
7389370 they threw serious allegations at them in order to get them to say horrible things against their mother
7389371 and her attorney said her clients religious beliefs precluded her from answering the male judge directly

7389392 my authority as the archbishop in the archdiocese of brisbane is scarcely recognised by the parish of st marys
7389393 they either want to belong to the roman catholic church or they want to start their own church
7389394 in the area of liturgy they make up their own particular rules in the way they worship god

7389418 they were exchanging words we got adam pushed him down the dugout and he stopped talking and bob kept coming i didnt think it was handled right

7389622 its just a confirmation that sen obama does not have the track record that minnesotans and americans are looking for
7389623 they simply picked a guy whos been in the senate since the year i was born 1972

7389634 deco sekali lagi tampil dengan sedikit daya magis saya pikir itulah yang akan membantu kami memenangi liga tahun ini
7389635 sekarang andriy tentu akan sangat termotivasi dan dia akan memiliki hasrta untuk menunjukkan kalau dia tak seperti apa yang sudah kita lihat selama bermukim di london dan membuktikan kalau dia adalah pesepakbola sejati
7389636 saya bahagia bisa menyambut kembali andriy yang sangat diinginkan milan saya pikir dia bisa berguna buat kami seperti yang sudah ditunjukkan di masa lalu
7389637 saya membuat kesalahan dan pergi sebelum seharusnya untungnya pietro tak cedera parah saya mengharapkan semua yang terbaik untuk dia dan semoga dia cepat pulih
7389638 apapun juga itu tak mengubah apapun karena mesinnya lantas rusak sekarang kami harus berkonsentrasi untuk mempesiapkan diri untuk seri berikutnya dan membenahi performa kami di kualifikasi
7389639 anda memang dibuat khawatir tapi itu tak seburuk yang terlihat dia sedikit terguncang tapi akan baik baik saja
7389640 seluruh tim bermain dengan baik dan kami mendominasi jalannya pertandingan selama 70 menit namun mereka kemudian mencetak gol dan mendapatkan semangatnya kembali dari itu
7389641 bermain selama 120 menit di awal musim memang tak pernah mudah
7389642 bagaimana saya di bawah kepelatihan mourinho well saya menikmatinya tetapi yang lebih penting lagi adalah untuk memenangi pertandingan
7389643 kemarin sabtu saya meraih pole dan sekarang merengkuh kemenangan dengan catatan fastest lap menyempurnakan itu semua anda tak bisa mendapatkan hasil yang lebih baik lagi terutama di balapan ke 100 saya semua hasil tersebut didukung oleh mesin ferrari

7389645 are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7389646 you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out
7389647 in my judgment it wont be any better five months from now
7389648 my goal was to bring myself and my personality into this project
7389649 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether barack obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7389650 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7389651 joe biden believes the war was a mistake john mccain would still do it all over again joe biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years if barack obama and joe biden had set iraq policy these last six years rather than george bush and john mccain we wouldnt be in the hole were in today
7389652 the president always has the right to act preemptively if we are in imminent danger if they are coming up over the hill he can respond if troops are coming out of tijuana heading north we can respond if they are coming down from toronto we can respond if missiles are on their way we can respond but that is not the way i hear it being used here we are talking about preemption as if we are adopting a policy
7389653 the power of the purse is useless because it presents us with a hobsons choice
7389654 we have our fighting men and women in place and we are told by the way the president will not take them home so lets cut off the support for them so they have no guns no bullets no ability to fight a war and no one is willing to do that
7389655 any series we have with new york is going to be a big series but when we come off of a win like this i feel like everyone will show up and just have a little more energy and be able to feed off this game
7389656 one of the funnest games ive been a part of in a long time
7389657 weve got a day to regroup and we probably need to
7389658 a few of us were talking that its probably a lot bigger than just a regular win given the way the blue jays are playing and that theyre trying to catch up to us
7389659 he continues to impact the game and well take it we need it
7389660 hes stepped in and been a valuable member of our ballclub
7389661 the minute you make a mistake vernon wells hits it 400 feet
7389662 looked like he just got done with a 15 round fight
7389663 the fact that ellsbury stayed in and played that game it might be a little over dramatic but i thought he grew up a little bit today
7389664 he understood where we were physically with the rest of our team and what he can do by staying in the game i thought that was huge
7389665 i got up on the wall there and got up as high as i could and made the catch
7389666 we have quite a bit of space to commemorate high school swimming in the state
7389667 you really look at me being ancient but there were guys who were active in swimming in the 40s and 50s
7389668 our goal was to make sure the efforts of these men were never forgotten and i think weve done a pretty good job of recognizing who the forefathers were of who got high school swimming going in massachusetts
7389669 but the key point of it is the swim coaches hall of fame
7389670 thats our hook and well try to build on it from there
7389671 in the process i think its brought the coaches statewide closer together because the folks out west we really dont see them except at the state meet
7389672 chappys been very active to get them on board for this
7389673 i knew for a long time that coaching at a high level is what i wanted to do it happened so fast that im really embracing it right now
7389674 ive been looking forward to coaching with coach valli for a long time he wasnt easy to play for he really rode me which is what i needed at the time someone to get on my back
7389675 its a similar situation with high school i didnt really have a lot of experience
7389676 thats how its going to be at college i hope to earn the teams and the players respect
7389677 ill play it as it goes after each season reevaluate where i am and how far i really want to take it
7389678 we seem to be off to a very good start im pleased
7389679 were a small community the faculty are close colleagues when he took the job in milford and i was appointed to replace him he was fantastic i still e mail him with the little questions
7389680 im a big supporter anyways now im just in a different role
7389681 sabes que pasa que vamos a tener que llevar a algunos amigos de los chicos porque los nenes est n en edad de que se aburren con sus padres
7389682 a mi no me vas a llevar en carpa como una ind gena

7389689 for all the lengths senators barack obama and john mccain have gone to in keeping their hunt for a vice president under wraps their deliberations are in some ways being conducted in plain sight in indiana last week mr obama appeared with
7389690 barack is in a different situation and he needs somebody who can be safe and steady
7389691 its time to bite the bullet senator nunn get with the program
7389692 as can be seen by revisiting nunns past words and deeds the true source behind opposition to gay service was never concerns about unit cohesion as was often stated but moral animus to gay rights
7389693 strongly held moral belief that homosexuals should not be role models for our children
7389694 american family deterioration is one of the biggest problems we face in our culture
7389695 if obama picks former sam nunn as his vice presidential running mate
7389696 i would have a hard time voting for the democratic ticket i would be virtually useless in trying to convince other gays and lesbians to support the ticket
7389697 nunns positions on equal rights for the lgbt community should be reason enough to keep him off the ticket
7389698 the idea of obama picking nunn to run as his vice president is preposterous
7389699 as sen barack obama considers potential running mates he should contemplate with caution
7389700 if obama taps nunn he could end up adding gay men and lesbians to the list of disgruntled democrats they might not vote for mccain but they might very well stay home
7389701 revisiting is not admitting a mistake or apologizing for the pain he inflicted or the tens of thousands of lives affected by the policy surely there are more compelling choices out there for vice president
7389702 we dont think he would be a good choice i dont think there is any serious talk of him being selected for vice president i dont think its something our community should be alarmed about but its something our community should be aware of
7389703 for all nunns qualifications there would be very little enthusiasm for him within the lgbt community
7389704 as can be seen by revisiting nunns past words and deeds the true source behind opposition to gay service was never concerns about unit cohesion as was often stated but moral animus to gay rights
7389705 senator nunn has got to go all the way on opening the military to qualified gays and lesbians who want to serve not half way as hes been doing lately
7389706 no single issue more poignantly snaps our armed forces into the 21st century than the question of whether homosexuals should be permitted to serve openly in their ranks
7389707 our military cannot afford to stray long from the society it defends the pressures for it to catch up are mounting within and without
7389708 it might be time to take another look at dont ask dont tell
7389709 because hes an interesting black man he needs a sober experienced older establishment player who will be respected by the press the first responders of the political game theyll set the tone in which the choice is celebrated or not he needs someone like sam nunn
7389710 obama is going to need people who understand the global landscape and know how to work washington to get things done and thats where nunn can be a huge help
7389711 frankly the assertion that gays liberal and democratic gays that is may sit out the presidential race if nunn is chosen by obama is difficult to take seriously given obamas record in illinois and in the senate his overall ideology and the effusive endorsement of him earlier this month by the human rights campaign the nations largest gay lesbian bisexual and transgender civil rights group its absurd to suggest that politically interested gays who otherwise agree with obama and share his values would withhold their vote if he selected nunn to join his ticket
7389712 i reported that to them and they had both of those names on their list
7389713 if barack obama selected georgias former u s senator sam nunn as his vice presidential running mate would you be more or less likely to vote for barack obama
7389714 but nunn may be the best pick for barack obama in a year when the presumptive democratic nominee has no obvious choices if some potential candidate could immediately offer strength to obama on the economy he should pick him or her but no one fits that bill which leaves the field open to a foreign policy heavyweight who could help compensate for the slim resume of a freshman senator the notion that obama would be better off pretending this weakness didnt exist that he should double down on change with a young running mate ignores the readiness bar obama still needs to clear
7389715 on the whole nunns resistance to gays in the military 15 years ago it ought to be noted would be a plus for an obama led ticket not a minus obama unlike john mccain doesnt really have a problem with his base in this election
7389716 a nunn candidacy will be opposed by many in the gay community because of his advocacy of the
7389717 last week just before the fourth of july former georgia senator sam nunn predicted dont ask dont tell will ultimately end
7389718 big issues such as energy policy the war in iraq and health care and washingtons inability to deal with them are weighing on the former senator he loves to solve the problem said gordon giffin former chief counsel for nunn nunn seems to have studied obamas entire platform he thinks he can make a contribution now obamas team said the illinois senator deeply respects senator nunns leadership on national security nunns former chief of staff said the nations daunting problems have made nunn a lifelong democrat with gravitas and a reputation as a problem solver a particularly attractive candidate this year
7389719 bob barrs libertarian candidacy will likely hurt republicans in georgia and help put the state in play for obama georgia has 15 electoral votes a 30 vote swing but obama wont take georgia without sam nunn as his running mate nunn is also a leading democratic thinker on defense and foreign policy issues
7389720 the traveling press corps trailing the presumptive democratic nominees campaign bombarded bayh and nunn with questions over reports both democrats are on obamas shortlist for vice president
7389721 it is always nice to have your name mentioned it is an honor but i have no expectation of being offered any office and i am not in any way sitting on the edge of a chair ready to go back into government
7389722 sen barack obama was flanked by two potential running mates wednesday as experts talked about dirty bombs anthrax and attacks on the nations computer infrastructure many eyes were trained on evan bayh of indiana and sam nunn of georgia both have been listed as potential obama running mates and both live in key red states that obamas campaign has targeted for the general election
7389723 for all the lengths senators barack obama and john mccain have gone to in keeping their hunt for a vice president under wraps their deliberations are in some ways being conducted in plain sight in indiana last week mr
7389724 barack is in a different situation and he needs somebody who can be safe and steady
7389725 to charge the battery use a computer or a ac usb charger not included
7389726 my goal was to bring myself and my personality into this project
7389727 the political response has run the gamut from fearful protectionism to welcoming the funds as a source of stabilizing cash for businesses caught in a downturn most adept politicians are taking a wait and see approach while financial insiders tend to stress the importance of keeping markets open and welcoming the inflow
7389728 sovereign nations have interests other than maximizing profits and can be expected to pursue them with every tool at their disposal including financial power for this reason congress must establish standards for transparency and behavior now to prevent unwarranted interference in our economy by foreign governments
7389729 02 13 08 the wall street journal time for sovereign wealth fund rules
7389730 we need to have a lot more control over what they sovereign wealth funds do and how they do it
7389731 the emergence of sovereign funds challenges us to ask whether these many benefits of markets and private ownership will be threatened if government ownership in the economy becomes more significant when the regulator and the regulated are one and the same deference to sovereign wealth funds can all too easily trump vigorous and neutral enforcement when individuals with government power also possess enormous commercial power and exercise control over large amounts of investable assets the risk of misuse of those assets and of their conversion for personal gain rises markedly unchecked this would be the ultimate insider trading tool
7389732 in the face of the increasing power of extremely aggressive speculative funds and sovereign funds which do not obey economic logic france is taking the political and strategic choice to protect its companies to give them the means to defend and develop themselves
7389733 the logic of the capitalist system depends on shareholders causing companies to act so as to maximize the value of their shares it is far from obvious that this will over time be the only motivation of governments as shareholders imagine that a swf makes an investment in a major bank of another nation that goes bad is there anybody in the world that can assert that with billions of dollars on the line their head of state and foreign minister are not going to get involved in the negotiations
7389734 swfs have been and will continue to be a high priority for the committee
7389735 because sovereign wealth funds by definition are potentially susceptible to noneconomic interests the closer they come to exercising control and influence the greater concerns we have the question of the day is whether these huge pools of investment dollars known as sovereign wealth funds make the u s economy stronger or pose serious national security risks
7389736 do sovereign wealth funds make the u s economy stronger or pose national security risks
7389737 i am concerned if these sovereign wealth funds are motivated by more than just market considerations and thats obviously a possibility if they are buying big chunks of financial institutions and their board s of directors influence how credit flows in this country and they may be swayed by political considerations or foreign policy considerations i think that is a concern
7389738 we are going to look at the big picture of this phenomenon and try to gauge what are the policy implications for these funds in the u s
7389739 i think the threat of swfs being used to exert political pressure is a legitimate worry but im not sure we have seen signs of that yet
7389740 how do we actually deal with funds in state hands this is a phenomenon which until now has not existed on such a scale
7389741 we open our arms to hug them if they wish to conduct acquisitions in london there will be no problem if the acquisitions are in accordance with british supervisory laws
7389742 unencumbered trade in goods and services and cross border investment creates the greatest opportunity for growth both in the united states and abroad
7389743 policies that impede cross border investment can lead to inefficient decisions and potentially reduce aggregate investment
7389744 may be interpreted by other potential investors as an indication that the united states is inhospitable to foreign investors
7389745 we want to be encouraging people to invest as much of this money in the u s as we can we are driving our way around the country every day and sending them our u s dollars at 3 or 4 a gallon you really want those dollars recycled back into your economy because if they arent it means they are going somewhere else and the dollar is less attractive and will continue to weaken
7389746 mr redikerof points out that the money invested in the us is from oil profits but fails to make the connection that americans may rebel against swfs for that very same reason
7389747 their commitment contributes to value creation and employment in germany and also to stabilisation in times of financial market turbulence as we are currently experiencing
7389748 swfs have invested most actively in the us approximately 85bn 54bn 43bn or 0 5 per cent of the total value of the us equity market it is hard to see why these investments have harmed americans they are a tiny fraction of the total market in each case the entities receiving the capital decided that the price and terms were superior to what they could secure elsewhere more important this is how the markets are supposed to work it is only a matter of time before swfs are represented on boards of companies in which they invest and they should be all shareholders would benefit from a large important swf in the boardroom
7389749 those speaking out against scrutiny of the funds include businesses such as blackstone merrill lynch and citigroup all of whom have benefited from a cash inflow from swfs during the credit crisis of the past few years funds themselves have also been critical of any negative response of their investments especially immediately after the announcement of the imfs plan to create a code of conduct
7389750 merrill lynch who has especially benefited from an inflow of cash from singapores temask and koreas investment fund during a downturn praised swfs in a recent press release
7389751 its like the sovereign wealth funds are guilty until proven innocent
7389752 if somebody comes with regulations that make it difficult for someone from certain geographical locations to invest in europe or the west people will take their investment somewhere else if you put a politician in charge of an investment believe me that investment fund will not last for a very long time
7389753 we reiterate our misgivings regarding the funds involvement in setting best practices for sovereign wealth funds the imf does not have the requisite expertise in the areas of governance and transparency to take the lead in producing a set of best practices for swfs
7389754 a perceived serious potential of dissident american groups rising up against
7389755 the stated cause for such an uprising appear to be growing
7389756 reform may be necessary but reform is a matter for the state

7389761 the notion of stolen elections is something we assign to third world countries but not this beacon of freedom and democracy that we like to view ourselves as
7389762 american elections have become like a game of russian roulette every time you go to the voting booth
7389763 both of the major political parties have a serious case of shortsightedness
7389764 this is a battle about election integrity and thats what i think uncounted is about but democrats are under the impression that by talking about election integrity its going to keep people away from the voting booth and lower voter turnout thats bizarre
7389765 i assumed we would see a repeat of the 2000 election and a long fight but kerry conceded pretty quickly
7389766 i was sure the media would then begin to look into these irregularities that took place particularly in ohio with the exit polls i remember sitting in my favorite coffee shop reading the new york times and looking for a story but there was nothing just complete silence i thought i had to look into this as a citizen because it just didnt seem right
7389767 i think this is a documentary that takes a 30 000 foot view of this issue of election fraud and explains why people should be concerned
7389768 we grew up believing in this dream of what this country is supposed to be and i think people are offended that they are being disrespected that their vote is being disrespected
7389769 the notion of widespread voter fraud is itself a fraud evidence of actual fraud by individual voters is painfully skimpy
7389770 the reality is our vote is not protected and its likely that the 2008 election results will be manipulated even worse than in 2004 and 2000
7389771 if you dont support george bush youre anti american and anti god
7389772 if you dont agree with every bleeding thing the president says youre anti american
7389773 if you dont agree with everything the president says youre a racist
7389774 the first thing that happened was that the russian tanks came in
7389775 from our point of view the georgian military was responding to a russian invasion

7389781 were expecting the worst of the tropical storm this afternoon
7389782 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7389783 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7389784 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world
7389785 testimony to the fact that the world has rested its trust in china
7389786 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7389787 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7389788 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7389789 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way
7389790 theres nobody here mr denton nobody ever comes in here
7389791 oh well i dont think id have to disagree with that
7389792 you know im going in there supposedly helping the families of state troopers and really im being used and the people of texas are being used
7389793 what were you told that your job was going to be
7389794 that i would be calling texans just to make donations for troopers that had died in the line of duty
7389795 when they heard that he was in pursuit of a speeding vehicle and he got broadsided by an 18 wheeler people were like oh my god i want to help them you know and it did have a big effect
7389796 yeah i mean thats what one office makes in one or two weeks we have 5 offices throughout texas
7389797 it is very excessive and thats a very high salary for a relatively low income
7389798 no they did not fill it out they did not provide information
7389799 two mercedes and a lexus how do you justify those vehicle purchases all near 50 000
7389800 and im not sure that i have i dont have privy to that
7389801 what would you say to people who say that youve been doing this for 20 years working collecting money by fundraising saying its going to a charitable cause and putting it in your pocket

7389821 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids and i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7389822 just when they thought it was possible it was taken away
7389823 we dont want none of that we dont want nothing to do with last year
7389824 no no i did not because i thought we had a good week and like i said the last two weeks we played halfway decent and i thought we would do that this week but it didnt happen
7389825 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the world

7389833 the only similarity between the two stories is a cross in the dirt but it is hardly an unlikely coincidence that there were practicing christians in both russia and vietnam or that in the prisons of those two communist countries the only crosses to be found were etched in the dirt as easily disappeared as the christians who drew them
7389834 but those desperate to discredit senator mccains record will have to impugn his fellow prisoners as well
7389835 it may be typical of the pro obama to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement but most americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others
7389836 as swindle said this is a desperate group of people trying to make something out of nothing

7389851 i was one of those guys supporting obama before he even announced he was running i was running around with the run obama run sticker so i was a supporter from the start
7389852 i am excited to be an obama delegate im a political activist and im so excited to be there to cast that important vote
7389853 there is a slim possibility if super delegates divert but i doubt that seriously but we will be ready for it well deliver the votes to obama
7389854 we need some rules to break some old rules play isnt anarchy
7389855 everyday i wake up and think what am i going to do today that is impossible

7389866 if we create or become a mirror image of the religious right we have failed
7389867 but if we have increased the number of chairs around the table then weve succeeded
7389868 people of faith are being engaged in the convention in a new and robust way and its because of senator obamas acknowledgment that people of faith and values have an important place in american public life
7389869 now theres a genuine interest in speaking with groups and religious groups who were previously considered enemies

7389872 jorge went down to venezuela for a friendly against syria on wednesday
7389873 our belief is that him being in venezuela and being a known quantity in venezuela he would have had a much better chance of getting his p 1 in venezuela then in two countries he would have been qualifying against that was why we made the decision to send him down on wednesday and play against syria rather than wait and chance it in peru or paraguay
7389874 the u s consulate believed that the passport could be doctored and was not willing to issue a passport because of that

7389876 the capture of abu tiba and abu othman eliminates two of the few remaining experienced leaders in the aqi network
7389877 the coaching staff is extremely pleased and proud of the effort today of the whole team and a well deserved three points against a very good team hopefully we can build on these last three games and we continue to add points and try to achieve our main goal which is to make the playoffs
7389878 we had three very important players missing and the guys that got the chance today took it with both hands and made the best out of it
7389879 we know they had two tough games last weekend and mid week and had been traveling so if you go up on teams like this that are already feeling some things in their legs its important fortunately we were able to keep a clean sheet and take some confidence from the game
7389880 juan pablo in the air is a big huge threat as we saw again today he promoted that good cross to a great goal so that was great
7389881 it was an unbelievable cross by dave he always has outstanding crosses and i was lucky to get on the end of it
7389882 for the first time this year i think we actually have depth to compete with a team like houston
7389883 once we get going and get some good confidence we are able to work real well and its great
7389884 obviously im real happy personally to get a second straight clean sheet its great for the back four too
7389885 today we showed that we are back in contention again
7389886 next week is going to be a big test for us i think from now to the end of the season every game is going to be hard because everything is tight in the standings
7389887 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7389888 we dont have any illusions about the challenges we face in getting our message out but you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7389889 there should be a balance and we want to make sure were available to tell the other side of the story
7389890 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7389891 general opinion in the party is in favor of parting ways
7389892 the nets are my day job brooklyn is my night job
7389893 whether its at the end of a game or that last sale needed to make the monthly budget i want the ball thats pretty much been my dna
7389894 this is what it will truly look like from your seat
7389895 we are in the storytelling business when i talk to a sponsorship partner i say do you want to be part of the next chapter if you can get people to imagine you get them hooked
7389896 i got barclays to think about what it would feel like to own a landmark it was a call to action
7389897 i thought they were calling about selling us season tickets or a suite
7389898 i was surprised the call was from the ceo maybe thats what prompted me to take the call brett planted the seed he found us
7389899 yormark treats barclays like hes still courting us not like a company that he already signed a deal with
7389900 he never quits he gets up earlier than everyone else and goes to bed later during all of his waking hours he is selling setting up appointments to sell some more or thinking of something else to sell
7389901 very few people in the industry can move the needle meaningfully

7389905 strategy strategy strategy we were the only car that got it right today and we couldnt be happier all the pieces of the puzzle are now in place and were looking forward to a very good petit le mans the teams next alms race
7389906 it was quite an exciting race day for me especially this morning when there was a little accident in the warmup
7389907 im very happy that we got another podium in our first alms season i think it shows how amazingly the team works together and how good a package we have with a little bit more luck in finding the right race setup we could have had a chance to win the race but today the ferrari was just a little bit stronger i had to fight very hard to go the speed i went i couldnt do it over the whole stint but we can be happy with the result because everything went right for us thanks to the team for a great race
7389908 on the other hand the high prices are driving criminals to do anything they can
7389909 we hope to make life very hard for these people
7389910 in nine years we have never had anything like that happen
7389911 we talked about what we could do with colleges given the fact that we have so much traffic coming from them
7389912 the light bulb went off by simul streaming fringe and sarah connor the college students get to see the show and we get the increased fanbase and buzz
7389913 the crystal ball at this stage is unusually unclear given that we are a year into this financial crisis
7389914 the fed listens to wall street and believes what it hears
7389915 likelihood and severity of future crises have been heightened we shall pay the price for that
7389916 possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7389917 improved disclosures alone cannot solve all of the problems consumers face in trying to manage their credit card accounts
7389918 would severely curtail the ability of creditors to react to adverse changes in a borrowers risk characteristics during the term of the account
7389919 has a lot of language in their letter saying that we support reform but then they attack the most important piece of the proposal
7389920 water down its regulation underscores the need to pass credit card reform legislation
7389921 if we ever needed a mild winter we need it now
7389922 the economy will be struggling to remain in positive territory
7389923 the added financial burden of heating our homes will make this the toughest winter since that of 2001 2002
7389924 not only are energy costs going through the roof but peoples incomes are going down
7389925 the bond market is not nearly as transparent as the stock market

7389941 i personally dont like american style pizza its taste more like a snack food than a real meal i was in the us several times and everything taste so artificial the foods in the restaurants are so sweet not in the chic expensive restaurant
7389942 the greatest contribution of us food to the world is mcdonalds us is chains mass production with little character

7389944 i will agree it takes effort to find non artificially flavored stuff
