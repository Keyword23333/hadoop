1910003 dus dames jullie en ik wij vind ik nog zo voorbarig zijn aangekomen bij nieuwe woningen bij een stukje stedelijke herstructurering dit was een paar jaar geleden de rotte plek van de stad kleine arbeiderswoningen van n laag met kap blinde muren amper isolatie kliko buiten afgetrapte autos op straat overwoekerend groen afgezien van deze negatieve eigenschappen leefden er eerlijke en lieve mensen er heerste een sterke sociale samenhang maar ondanks dit deed de jonge knul het met de oudere wulpse buurvrouw maar goed de hedendaagse situatie ik weet niet of dit laatste nog zo is ik ben geen jonge knul meer zonder uit te weiden over die tijd neem ik u terug naar het nu door de sloop moesten mensen tijdelijk verhuizen er werd beloofd een nieuw huis te bouwen en mensen werden elders ondergebracht de nieuwbouw kwam laat vertraging in procedure en door bouwfraude en daardoor is niet de gehele bevolking teruggekeerd naar de opgepoetste buurt de teruggekeerden herkennen en groeten elkaar op straat maar er zijn missende schakels in de straat die van remie en oomen wonen en leven bijvoorbeeld in de haagse beemden ze komen ook niet meer langs
1910004 dit is de talmastraat vroeger een oud lint tussen de oranjeboom en het gehucht roskam tussen breda en het zuiden een paar jaar geleden was dit een typische rafelrand een rafel tussen de stad en het platteland met het daarbij horende ruimtegebruik zo zaten er een sloper een boksclub volkstuinen een voetbalvereniging en een paar oude boerderijen het neerplenzen van diverse functies kon hier het maakte niet uit het had geen waarde niemand zag het de mensen en verenigingen zijn momenteel tegen aardige betaling verhuisd en ondanks veel bezwaar van de overgeblevenen aan de andere zijde van de talmastraat zullen er tussen de weg en de rondweg woningen worden gebouwd drie torens van zestig meter hoog vier door water omringde clusters eilanden en luxe woningen in een bosrijke omgeving totaal los van de structuur sociaal economisch ruimtelijk functioneel en alles wat je meer kunt bedenken van de arbeiderswijk

1910125 the surveying industry was lagging behind in terms of the online delivery that we provided to the rest of the property market we wanted to provide better services for the survey industry and to bring this in line with the rest of the property industry
1910126 preserving original documents is never going to make money per se but it delivers huge value in how they clients develop land
1910127 our surveying customers work underpins three to four billion dollars in the property market every year because every piece of land needs to be surveyed before being developed or given a title its the foundation of land information and land development
1910128 it gave us our valuable foot print in our midland premises back
1910129 once all the field books go online we can recover the space which is taken by microfiche scanners readers and printers
1910130 weve always identified that scanning the originals and or microfiche was an obvious solution to making it available online through our existing portal but the cost of scanning all the documents was prohibitive it was in the millions of dollars the opportunity came in the improvements in equipment used to digitise the microfiche
1910131 they dont have the same ability in the current environment their feedback also helped determining the size and resolution of the documents
1910132 if you compare that now to our storage requirements for digital aerial imagery thats 19tb with 146tb offline so in the scheme of things with our digital aerial and satellite imagery this was fairly small
1910133 were talking data sets that were completely different to the originals some were 150 years old and these are still being used
1910134 actually thats one of the things this project isnt addressing because were only doing monochrome the original survey books are basically monochrome but the colours on the crown lands documents represent different states and descriptions of the land most of those wouldnt be understood without looking at originals however if you want to check the originals will still be available
1910135 certainly one of the positives from it has been our ability to react to industry wishes the industry has been calling for this for a long time we hold regular information evenings for professional development and the discussion of digitising field books has gone on for a number of years

1910170 they dont mean to kill muslims if they do so then they either didnt mean to or its a lie spread by the governmental crusaders media

1910198 in 1934 the professor of anthropology at the university of sydney ae elkin published a small pamphlet which called for a positive policy which aims at the welfare and development of the aborigines following his call a 70 year journey of government led policy experiments to build a future for the aborigines began the mood of these experiments has since lurched erratically between rather pessimistic realism and over optimistic hope the most recent experiment was the decision in june to dispatch police troops and medical workers to protect aboriginal children on the remote settlements of the northern territory the howard government has now altogether abandoned the hopes embedded in the language of reconciliation realism once more rules how did we arrive at this point
1910199 it was noel pearson who broke the ideological stalemate over aboriginal policy and the remote communities pearson had been a land rights activist and a man of the left at one memorable moment in the early years of the howard government during the political skirmishes surrounding native title he had labelled his conservative opponents racist scum in 1999 he shifted gear pearson now acknowledged that over the past quarter century or so the communities at cape york had experienced what he would call a descent into hell for the left insofar as problems of violence sexual abuse suicide alcoholism drug dependency petrol sniffing gambling illiteracy truancy and child neglect were acknowledged the historic process of colonisation and the trauma associated with the dispossession were blamed although this explanation might in the most general sense be true for pearson it was not only useless by explaining everything it explained nothing but also misleading

1910239 as to elections being the only form of term limits in which he believes
1910240 thats pithy glib and thoroughly duplicitous as an incumbent mr obama knows full well that members of congress have now skewed the laws to give themselves a virtual guarantee of a lifetime job and as the self appointed apostle of change he ought to be taking the lead to change all that inequity

1910291 is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon and senator mccain not only wants them to keep every dime of that money he wants to give them more so make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain

1910304 we hope that everyone will understand and support this decision as it is the only right one for the circumstances we want to deliver a full production and a killer live experience when we finally come to south america and not some amputated half assed shows it is a known fact that it takes a considerable amount of time to organise such a tour in south america as opposed to europe not to mention finding the right promoters our main priority now is to set our minds 100 into making this album as astonishing as it has to be and therefore we see no other alternative than to postpone the tour please note that we are using the word postpone here we will reach your shores after the new album is released to give you a show that you as well as the band deserves

1910326 during the nine months of its steady works our committee held hearings in mexico new york city and paris it collected many scores of affidavits and depositions and examined hundreds of letters and documents as well as making a complete analysis of the testimony given in the moscow trials as a result of its prolonged thorough and impartial investigation for none of its ten members is a trotskyite or affiliated in any way with his theories and activities it found trotsky and his son innocent of the charges brought against them it found that the prosecutor made no effort to ascertain the truth and that his procedure contradicted at every point the rules laid down for legal procedure in russian law in a book edited by the prosecutor himself it found that the three alleged interviews with trotsky said to have occurred in copenhagen paris and oslo never took place this finding being supported by a mass of notarised depositions by persons in personal contact with trotsky at the time the interviews were alleged to have been held many of them by his political adversaries on the basis of all the evidence we found that trotsky never recommended plotted or attempted the restoration of capitalism in the u s s r it was clearly established that the prosecutor at the trials fantastically falsified trotskys role before during and after the october revolution in short the report proves the moscow trials to be a frame up later a volume of some two hundred pages will be published giving in full the evidence on which our findings rest
1910327 has no more meaning to john dewey than the fight between schmeling and joe louis
1910328 the great lesson to be derived from these amazing revelations is the complete breakdown of revolutionary marxism nor do i think that a confirmed communist is going to get anywhere by concluding that because he can no longer believe in stalin he must pin his faith on trotsky the great lesson for all american radicals and for all sympathisers with the u s s r is that they must go back and reconsider the whole question of means of bringing about social changes and of truly democratic methods of approach to social progress
1910329 the dictatorship of the proletariat has led and i am convinced always must lead to a dictatorship over the proletariat and over the party i see no reason to believe that something similar would not happen in every country in which an attempt is made to establish a communist government

1910334 i can imagine that folks need a break from politics and they didnt really get one like they normally do
1910335 i think that the majority of people have been fed a constant stream of political chatter

1910343 trust me i have been doing this for 35 years i know how to protect prisoners
1910344 the judge did what he thought was right we dont agree
1910345 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1910346 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the chinese people to express theirs
1910347 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
1910348 the reason im going to the olympics is two fold one to show my respect for the people of china and two to cheer on the u s team
1910349 and by the way the order ought to be reversed as to why i may went i hope our team wins as many gold medals as possible and if not win gold silver and if not silver bronze

1910352 i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
1910353 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement about the prospects of changing this country
1910354 senator obama and i share the goal of ensuring that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
1910355 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
1910356 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
1910357 no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
1910358 sen clinton is 100 percent committed to helping barack obama become the next president of the united states
1910359 she is very appreciative of the continued commitment of her supporters and understands there are passionate feelings around the convention while no decisions have been made at this time they will be made collaboratively with sen clinton and her staff the dnc and sen obamas campaign and released at the appropriate time
1910360 completely idiotic idea that leads to nothing but party disharmony
1910361 its a reflection of genuine frustration by hillary clinton supporters that sen obama seems to have forgotten about 18 million voters
1910362 my concern about sen obama is he doesnt recognize that the outreach to the clinton grass roots has to be more visible more overt as well as more symbolic
1910363 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success
1910364 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
1910365 her supporters want after 18 million votes and the record of success from march 1 through june 1 to feel recognized and i think we should
1910366 we will have this in hand for sen clinton should this be needed
1910367 its been a tradition since the late 1800s its a nominating convention you vote you nominate someone and you come out unified i dont see how alienating 1 800 delegates gives you party unity when we walk out of the stadium
1910368 hillary delegates feel like were not welcome needed or valued
1910369 what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
1910370 and as i have said the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like they have a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
1910371 and thats what we want people to feel we do not want any democrat either in the hall or in the stadium or at home walking away saying well you know im just not satisfied im not happy because i mean thats what im trying to avoid
1910372 sen clinton will play a critical role in this convention and is also playing a critical role in the campaign
1910373 she has campaigned for obama raised money for him and spoken on his behalf on several occasions we appreciate and look forward to her continued support
1910374 i urge every labourite worth his or her own salt to protest at this travesty

1910491 i cant believe i made such a stupid error when telling you not to come with us
1910492 when you make a mistake i take full advantage of it and since you told nee san that she couldnt come with you i invited her to come with me
1910493 i have a good idea where we are heading i do believe we will pass close enough by the city where we met nee san to see what the magos did there as for the destination your guess is as good as mine lady hellia
1910494 can we stop by the city and see ojii san i want to make sure hes alright
1910495 we can go ahead and go when we get close to it brother wont stop because he didnt want you to come along also he doesnt like the fact hes travelling with not one but two living weapons
1910496 you know your brother well trent kun walks faster to catch up with ben would you tell me why you hated magic users so much
1910497 i dont see why its any of your business to know my reason for hating those magical bastards
1910498 it must have something to do with either mister koron or his brother from the village am i correct sir ben
1910499 whats wrong brother all coatl was talking about was mister koron and his brother keith
1910500 trent be quiet its because of those two that our village was destroyed theyre traitors
1910501 what are you talking about you and keith were best friends
1910502 my hatred for magic is far beyond my dissatification of having you tag a long miss ashley i will kill any magos i see and destroy any of their living weapons as well
1910503 we better set up camp for the night the sun will be down soon
1910504 curiousity killed the cat but i guess i can tell you without trent here seven months ago our village was experiencing a drought we didnt have rain or snow for the past six months prior suddenly it rained for four days straight not letting up at dusk of the fourth day the rain stopped as suddenly as it started come to find out our neighbor keith used water magic to call rain to our village he was inexperienced and was trying to prove to himself that he was better then his brother mister koron thought on the fourth day keith swallowed his pride and asked mister koron for help
1910505 from that it sounds like they loved your village why would you say they are traitors
1910506 thats only part of the story the next part happened four months ago when the magos oscuros attacked our village most of the warriors and fighters from our village went to defend our village while the rest escorted the rest of the village out of the valley where we lived when we did a head count we found out that keith was missing just then a lightning bolt struck our camp and it came from keith trent was sleeping during this time so i picked him up and with my mothers last breath she told me get out of here go i can never forgive keith and mister koron didnt do anything to stop keith it was like he lost his nerve to protect thats why i said earlier that i will slay trent if he becomes a mago

1910535 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state

1910541 but they sort of changed that stance a little bit when i got back up there we sort of figured that would happen otherwise they would have released me they didnt want to do that which i dont blame them but you know i really didnt see as much history as ive had in green bay and success i really didnt see the positives that could come out of it i felt like it was always going to be a distraction its best that they had a clear cut path that they were going to go on and if im going to play try to play elsewhere and see what happens

1910562 well no we havent been doing that maybe we should
1910563 we have a non partisan council being republican has nothing to do with it i dont know what ron did as far as helping someone get elected on council but does being a former republican party chairman mean his business cant apply for a tax abatement i dont think so
1910564 the law doesnt specify whether you are a republican or a democrat when you apply for a tax break all that is required is that a business meet the qualification set forth in the law and thats not one of them
1910565 now that may be an area for an honest conversation i dont really know the answer i would have to really study whether the benefits outweigh the costs

1910613 this was where you were supposed to get your first glimpse of your baby we had just been told that the young woman who was bringing zak had been delayed and we were trying to keep from feeling disappointed when the door at the far end of the hall opened and the woman appeared after all with our child without a word she came running down the hall and handed the baby to me he had round eyes and this little bit of an overbite and when i held him he smiled and grabbed my thumb zak was the child in my dream exactly the same child i recognized his face and i think he recognized mine at least he looked at me in the most knowing way right there dream and reality came together for me

1910632 then the contractor pulls out the contract and says sign here by then the consumer has lost their leverage theyre so invested in the process
1910633 theres a natural tension for the homeowner to wonder if the contractor will cheapen the project in ways they dont see because his profit is being eroded
1910634 i dont really know what it will cost is a scary thing
1910635 if their scores are not optimal customers are feeling that in the wallet a little bit
1910636 yes we do look at the escalation and cost clauses
1910637 the only solution is to ask the customer to come up with more cash or refinance the construction loan when the project is done or you make a separate second mortgage or lien of credit to cover the extra cost

1910662 she came into my life unexspectedly just as she has left me this precious little angel from above gave me strength and unconditional love now she is gone and i dont know why all i am guilty of is loving her and providing her a safe home jealousy has taken her away jealousy from the one person that should be thankfull for all of the love and support given to her a mothers love is deep however there are limits when one is betrayed by the one she loved and trusted the most a daughter comes to her mother for support when she is pregnant the mother says without hesitation it will be ok and it was but then the lies and betrayal began first it seemed harmless ah love is blind a mother will look for the good in her child and give them a chance to change this mother gave chance after chance for her daughter to change but instead more lies more betrayal what does the mother get for giving her daughter all of these chances a broken heart the daughter who stole money lots of money leaves without warning and does not let her mother now speak to the baby that her mother raised fed clothed sheltered paid her medical bills etc instead tells her friends that her mother is controlling her life and she needs her space no money no future where did she go who is now watching out for the little angel

1910664 there is something wrong i found my daughters car today and it smells like theres been a dead body in the damn car
1910665 based on the repetitive lies that the defendant has told we do not know with whom the child is or even if the child is alive
1910666 it should be noted that at no time during any of the above interviews did the defendant show any obvious emotion as to the loss of her child
1910667 briefly just before i came into the child abuse division i was a homicide detective for two years with the orange county sheriffs office and in my experience the smell that i smelled in that car was the smell of decomposition
1910668 not a bit of useful information has been provided by ms anthony as to the whereabouts of her daughter
1910669 and i would add that the truth and ms anthony are strangers
1910670 if that changes then obviously im going to reach out and say something immediately but i know mom will understand this more than anyone that theres that bond type of bond that you have with your kid and its unexplainable

1910676 the classic is that theres always some new cure for cancer that comes out
1910677 and unfortunately people become disappointed when it doesnt come to fruition but part of that is because it was preliminary findings and then when there are more mature findings or when its analyzed a different way with a larger sample size it really didnt come out to those same findings
1910678 i was surprised that of the scientific communications that companies give out that about 60 per cent of them are based on findings from abstracts
1910679 so the majority of the findings of the press releases are related to preliminary findings that arent fully peer reviewed
1910680 about a fifth of those they didnt really say where they got their data they just said findings of a study it was a real sherlock holmes type of enterprise to try and track down where this study came from or was this original data was this abstract data or was it presented at a meeting
1910681 but really they didnt talk about the study limitations and the idea that this is preliminary studies or preliminary data almost universally this was not discussed
1910682 they often talk about adverse events or harms in this study similar to what they would do with commercials on tv where they list a variety of adverse events or side effects or harms
1910683 however we can clearly state that as the community that develops medicines and vaccines that improve and save lives our members are committed to accuracy and transparency in all public communications
1910684 recognizing the space limitations of a press release and the complexity of the research and development of new medicines and vaccines other sources are readily available and accessible to journalists seeking further information including websites and contacts

1910775 the main issue from our point of view is that should diego pick up an injury werder bremen will be paid financial damages there should be a sufficient insurance policy for the player
1910776 a fee for his release or the reimbursement of his salary during the time that diego is not available to werder bremen is not at the top of our list of priorities
1910777 we have informed him of the situation and wished him all the success possible in the competition we hope that he can avoid injury and maybe even scores a goal or two

1910820 my clients think i am on the cutting edge of real estate marketing
1910821 the internet is a major factor in the way we do business we knew that the internet would only get stronger as time went along and because we are so easy to find on the internet we are selling homes to folks from outside our basic marketing area as well as within it
1910822 we had one buyer who was moving here from the east coast and found our website they began to correspond with us and soon i was setting up property searches for them so they could shop online i previewed a home for them and sent them additional pictures they wrote the offer and put a home under contract with us without ever having set foot in our town they came to town in time to sign the papers pick up their keys and move in another time we were working with two out of town agents helping a family relocate here they told us that they put in all sorts of different searches online and that we kept coming up so they figured we knew what we were doing in real estate since we obviously seemed to know about online marketing
1910823 i had enough success to realize that there had to be a better way of attracting buyers and i believed that the internet was the way
1910824 i use our internet presence as a selling point by taking some of our website reports to listing presentations to show prospective sellers that we receive plenty of traffic and lots of inquiries from our site
1910825 they all are impressed because they know that selling homes involves the internet today they are all very impressed that two grandmothers who bill ourselves as the hometown girls can actually be so technologically strong they know we have the local knowledge but they are sold when we show them our internet positions
1910826 we work with a lot of first time home buyers and people relocating to the amarillo area thanks to internet leads we dont have a specialty as far as type of property we sell we just sell great homes to wonderful panhandle people
1910827 and if anyone asked for my advice id tell them this never give up if you are practicing traditional real estate strategies that arent working for you anymore you might want to embrace the newer technologies and marketing strategies that utilize the internet

1910882 i n order to get at the activities of these new rhetors researchers have had to adopt radically new methods as well methods which violate some of the most cherished conventions of academic research most particularly in bringing the person of the researcher her body her emotions and dare one say her soul into the work

1910893 i thought youd be happier that i was being thorough and i really like making you happy
1910894 you know what would make me very happy right now
1910895 no well yes but what would really make me just ecstatic is if you would go straight to dr beckett and ask him to give you an inoculation
1910896 right you think lucius might try and come back while im still vulnerable
1910897 they didnt give me all those degrees for nothing colonel
1910898 you just go talk to carson and have him give you that inoculation
1910899 you didnt actually think that mentally yelling lock was going to keep me out did you
1910900 look it wasnt supposed to be how could i know you have some sort of weird underwear sniffing fetish
1910901 you were giving everyone such a hard time like you hadnt even considered the implications of what lucius could have done to teyla elizabeth kate cadman any of the halfway decent looking women on the base seriously colonel you were pissing off and alienating almost every xx chromosome on the base
1910902 you have got to be the worst military commander in the history of military commanders the fact that i have more tact than you do is frankly downright scary
1910903 jesus rodney what the hell were you thinking were sneaking around the wraith stealing stargates and you compromised me
1910904 its not like id have asked you to jump in front a bullet for me
1910905 you were under the influence of that herb too rodney think about it you wouldnt have had to ask

1910907 huh the road to hell really is a slippery slope and all that
1910908 you could have oh i dont know asked me to stop
1910909 i did and so did carson by the way and elizabeth and teyla and even ronon
1910910 i believe when carson said would you please shut up already about it or when ronon growled at you for the third time or when
1910911 that still doesnt justify turning me into your personal manservant or subjecting me to you your underwear
1910912 at least i didnt use an item you were deathly allergic too as some sort of moronic geek bashing inside joke
1910913 yes and the award goes to colonel asshole for finally getting it your commemorative plaque is in the mail thank you by the way for taking me back to my freshman year of high school in front of my peers
1910914 so you what violate my mind and humiliate me for revenge
1910915 is that moral superiority complex keeping you warm at night colonel
1910916 is there a reason you wanted me to stop or do i need to assign you pt until you can learn to keep up
1910917 the energy readings are to the left colonel assuming a straight line isnt too difficult for someone as directionally challenged as you are on the ground we should see the ruins in another ten or fifteen minutes at our current pace
1910918 and you need to learn a new word its obvious youve been hanging too much with cadman because you are starting to sound just like her
1910919 i think whatever they are shooting is similar to wraith stunners meant to incapacitate
1910920 look you guys are going to have to cover my position i have to perform cpr or the colonels dead
1910921 ronon please tell me youve incapacitated everyone so we can get the hell out of here

1910940 we have returned from the lesser jihad battle to the greater jihad
1910941 this hadith has no sources and nobody in the field of islamic knowledge has narrated it jihad against the disbelievers is the most noble of actions and moreover it is the most important action for the mankind
1910942 he often adulterates is very weak and narrates unknown hadith
1910943 abu hatim said that he is not a strong narrator ibn maeen classified him as weak and ad daraqutni said that he is to be neglected
1910944 not equal are those of the believers who sit at home except those who are disabled by injury or are blind or lame etc
1910945 jihaad is of four stages jihaad al nafs striving against the self jihaad al shayaateen striving against the shayaateen or devils jihaad al kuffaar striving against the disbelievers and jihaad al munaafiqeen means striving to make oneself learn true guidance and to follow it after coming to know it calling others to it and bearing with patience the difficulties of calling others to allaah jihaad al shaytaan means striving against him and warding off the doubts and desires that he throws at a person and the doubts that undermine faith and striving against the corrupt desires that he tries to inspire in a person jihaad against the kuffaar and munaafiqeen is done in the heart and on the tongue with ones wealth and oneself jihaad against the kuffaar mostly takes the form of physical action and jihaad against the munaafiqeen mostly takes the form of words the most perfect of people are those who have completed all the stages of jihaad people vary in their status before allaah according to their status in jihaad

1910948 the 100 a ranking of the most influential persons in history
1910949 my choice of muhammad to lead the list of the worlds most influential persons may surprise some readers and may be questioned by others but he was the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the religious and secular level
1910950 head of the state as well as the church he was caesar and pope in one but he was pope without the popes claims and caesar without the legions of caesar without a standing army without a bodyguard without a palace without a fixed revenue if ever any man had the right to say that he ruled by a right divine it was mohammad for he had all the power without instruments and without its support he cared not for dressing of power the simplicity of his private life was in keeping with his public life
1910951 philosopher orator apostle legislator warrior conqueror of ideas restorer of rational dogmas of a cult without images the founder of twenty terrestrial empires and of one spiritual empire that is muhammad as regards all standards by which human greatness may be measured we may well ask is there any man greater than he
1910952 the personality of muhammad it is most difficult to get into the whole truth of it only a glimpse of it i can catch what a dramatic succession of picturesque scenes there is muhammad the prophet there is muhammad the warrior muhammad the businessman muhammad the statesman muhammad the orator muhammad the reformer muhammad the refuge of orphans muhammad the protector of slaves muhammad the emancipator of women muhammad the judge muhammad the saint all in all these magnificent roles in all these departments of human activities he is alike a hero
1910953 i wanted to know the best of one who holds today undisputed sway over the hearts of millions of mankind i became more than convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for islam in those days in the scheme of life it was the rigid simplicity the utter self effacement of the prophet the scrupulous regard for his pledges his intense devotion to his friends and followers his intrepidity his fearlessness his absolute trust in god and in his own mission these and not the sword carried everything before them and surmounted every obstacle when i closed the 2nd volume of the prophets biography i was sorry there was not more for me to read of the great life
1910954 muhammad was the soul of kindness and his influence was felt and never forgotten by those around him
1910955 it was the first religion that preached and practiced democracy for in the mosque when the call for prayer is sounded and worshippers are gathered together the democracy of islam is embodied five times a day when the peasant and king kneel side by side and proclaim god alone is great i have been struck over and over again by this indivisible unity of islam that makes man instinctively a brother
1910956 the league of nations founded by the prophet of islam put the principle of international unity and human brotherhood on such universal foundations as to show candle to other nations
1910957 the fact is that no nation of the world can show a parallel to what islam has done towards the realization of the idea of the league of nations
1910958 i believe in one god and mahomet an apostle of god is the simple and invariable profession of islam the intellectual image of the deity has never been degraded by any visible idol the honor of the prophet have never transgressed the measure of human virtues and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of reason and religion
1910959 he is a prophet and not a poet and therefore his koran is to be seen as divine law and not as a book of a human being made for education or entertainment

1910963 the age of homespun haunts public discourse in debates over family farms anxieties about the deterioration of family values and invocations of lost community the mythology of homespun persists not only because it is adaptable to so many political persuasions but because it allows us to forget that greed and war were so much a part of the american past
1910964 he was dressed in his holland shirt with great laces sewed at the tail of it he had his silver buttons his white stockings his garters were hung round with shillings and he had girdles of wampum upon his head and shoulders

1911010 youll have to share a bathroom with ronon but this room has the biggest balcony and the best view
1911011 we were trying to get it set up before you got back but best laid plans
1911012 i guess now that you are here you can finish the kitchen and living room are out there and the coolest thing youve already seen with the transporter access directly to the room zelenka theorized this might have been the atlantean equivalent of a penthouse and we liberated a couple more of the big beds and i really think you are going to enjoy the balcony it connects with ronons but you can duct tape a line across it or whatever else you two want to do

1911018 the vacillation of data from one month to the next indicates a housing market in transition
1911019 the rise in pending home sales was broad based with all four regions showing gains this is welcome news because a rise in contract activity is necessary for an overall housing recovery with a tax credit now available to first time home buyers increases in home sales could be sustained with the momentum carrying into 2009
1911020 provisions to stem foreclosures are helpful but a greater lift to the economy should come from higher mortgage limits enhancements to the fha loan program and the first time home buyer tax credit
1911021 these are excellent tools that will help buyers get into the market to take advantage of the unprecedented drop in home prices in many areas as well as a wide selection of inventory to make an investment in their future
1911022 buyers entering the hardest hit markets in some cases with multiple bid offers may have put a floor on prices
1911023 in addition rising commodity prices and higher construction costs have resulted in a very unusual market today with existing home prices being less than replacement building costs in some areas home prices are projected to increase 3 to 6 percent in 2009
1911024 builders need to further cut production to help trim inventory however new home sales are expected to bottom around the second quarter of next year with slight gains in the second half of 2009

1911091 it used to be id drive onto a studio lot and the guard was like less than zero dude i loved chaplin now its iron man its not an algorithm anymore its a fixed number things have been zeroed out its the beginning of something but right now its still a void and we tend to think of the void as an abyss or a vacuum with nothing there in fact its a new road and what you should do on this new road is close for repairs close right away because that old vehicle is not going to work on that new road i mean if the cosmos is a loving healing thing that also spins real fast and erupts and does violent stuff and if there really is some kind of order to the whole thing then everything thats led up to this moment has to be part of it or the math doesnt work but in this transition phase i really am trying to live as much like a lizard as i can hot rock sun fly tongue

1911103 with a few exceptions most of the us mainstream was just stenography for the state

1911132 michael hasnt even played a down yet what are you talking about
1911133 at large the american people are unaware of the new id card passed under the real id act of 2005 it is a new national international id and its interactivity to databases can access our medical financial driving social security license s firearm regulations and political status
1911134 in essence it holds our private lives on a swipe able card that is then privy to any organization retailer or person requesting our identification or our money
1911135 the release of the real id act regardless of any homeland security reasoning in my opinion is a ridiculous idea to suggest to the american people
1911136 talk about orwellian idealism to the core tracking of all movement at all times and the many activities of all u s citizens through radio frequency identification
1911137 it is simply unreasonable to expect our border inspectors to be able to detect forgeries on documents that range from baptismal certificates from small towns in texas to cards that purport to reflect citizenship privileges in a province somewhere in canada
1911138 to protect the national security interests of the united states
1911139 this just furthers us towards u s federal control of all states and fades state borders
1911140 canada and mexico will have access to information as well since the u s canada and mexico recently became the north american union thats homeland security it looks more to me like we are moving toward a world government with the pedal to the floor
1911141 supporters claim it is not a national id because it is voluntary
1911142 however any state that opts out will automatically make non persons out of its citizens they will not be able to fly or take a train to make the preposterous claim that the bill does not establish a national id card this is dangerous and insulting nonsense

1911201 i am deeply saddened italy loses a leading personality of the countrys industrial life and the representative of a dynasty that did so much for the made in italy brand around the world
1911202 italy turin and the fiat group have lost a business figure who knew how to follow and develop the work of his grandfather pinin and his father sergio
1911203 the market is now speculating about a potential sale of the company
1911204 was an episodic activity the phases of the moon serving as a signal to the blood brothers of the animal societies that they should begin working themselves into a frenzy for the chase a signal doubly emphasized at the full moon by the plaintive howling of the wolves the hunters had chosen to imitate
1911205 the ancient greeks and romans associated the moon with the underworld and those human and inhuman entities who used the night to work their dark magic
1911206 the full moon is rarely mentioned in traditional tales certainly some of the ancient stories do depict the werewolf transforming during a full moon but most legends offer different means for changing into a wolf in the majority of legends to turn into a werewolf a man had to strip naked and put on a belt made of human skin given to him by the devil next he would rub wolf bane and deadly nightshade all over his body finally the man would stand in a magic circle and chant a spell this series of events would result in one mean and vicious werewolf

1911218 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
1911219 i would say that i will cheer for whoever wins chinese or canadian
1911220 i enjoy the sport itself ever since china won the bid to host the olympics seven years ago i have had mixed feelings i was very happy for china and the chinese people who i believe deserve to showcase the olympics
1911221 but i have also had a kind of feeling that it is not the time yet because china is still faced with a lot of different problems
1911222 the chinese government will prioritize the olympics over everything and i wasnt sure it was the time yet
1911223 i guess there is no perfect time so you see i still have mixed feelings and i believe that this represents the feelings of most chinese canadians here as well
1911224 most young people who have been infused with that focus will cheer for china
1911225 i think this is no good at all i remember a couple of year ago i watched a canada versus china womens soccer match and i tried to convince people that you cannot always be rooting for china that you have to think about being both canadian and chinese
1911226 china is the country we are from but canada is the country we live in
1911227 they should know who christine sinclair the burnaby womens soccer player is
1911228 rise of china is a double edged sword to the chinese diaspora on one hand a strengthening china helps raise the status of chinese living overseas on the other hand the china threat theory that comes with this continues to dominate many westerners minds
1911229 if team canada faces off with team china or hong kong or taiwan for some in an olympic game or world cup soccer game which team would you cheer for
1911230 the chinese community in canada has never been a homogeneous group
1911231 based on their background and where they come from their experience as an immigrant and their identity and sense of belonging to their home or host country can be very different
1911232 the longer one lives in canada the stronger the identity is with canada
1911233 itd be difficult for newer immigrants who are still struggling with filling the kids stomachs to declare they are canadians
1911234 but for those who have established themselves here the identity conflict is much smaller
1911235 and of course for the second generation on there is hardly any id crisis
1911236 investing in infrastructure is one way to stimulate a stagnant economy
1911237 it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the tax rates

1911242 she left it here she needs to come back and pick this shit up thats not right

1911244 i want to be judged not by the number of people we provide but by the results we provide by the end of the year
1911245 they can help us follow up on some of our investigations into illegal gun purchases
1911246 from the soviet days the georgians always discriminated against us
1911247 then in the 1990s they opened their prisons and sent convicts police and soldiers to fight us but we drove them out now they seem ready to attack us again but were not scared there are no cowards here
1911248 russias initial aim was to retaliate over kosovo claiming independence and to stop georgia joining nato and when the west showed its incapacity to act russia saw the possibility finally to annex these territories and redraw the borders of eastern europe
1911249 but we wouldnt be alone it would be a war of the caucasian peoples against georgia and russia would be obliged to protect its citizens
1911250 at a local level georgians and south ossetians can get on and want to live their lives in peace
1911251 but as regards the military situation if tension continues to rise then there is the potential for a deterioration into some form of armed conflict
1911252 we dont want war but we wont give up one centimetre of our territory to anyone
1911253 theres no way back we were part of the ussr not georgia and now we want to rejoin our people
1911254 there are white folks and then there are ignorant motherf ckers like you
1911255 thats the only way to cure an illness right diagnose it
1911256 i found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mothers race

1911272 of course i want to be the flag bearer again
1911273 it is hard for me to separate everything that is happening right now
1911274 to carry the flame is an honor among many that i have had at previous olympics and at this one but it is the kind of experience that i will appreciate most many years from now when i am older and can look back
1911275 i believe it is an honor that will probably go to one of our older olympians or athletes
1911276 someone who was a pioneer they have stood the test of time and have a deeper understanding and sentiment for the olympics and chinese sports i think these people are most suitable for such a historic task
1911277 as hosts we ought to take good care of other teams and its up to you to decide what take good care means
1911278 the sound quality amazing the screen is brilliant and i took some sample shots with the 2 megapixel camera and found it even better than my own lg
1911279 the darned thing is so thin and slick its hard to hold a rigid thin slab is not actually very easy to hold in your round fleshy palm
1911280 if i had to it over again i would not have bought this expensive classy impractical two seater roadster id have bought the toyota camry that my wife did the lg8300 its a nearly perfect cellphone
1911281 if team canada faces off with team china or hong kong taiwan for some interviewees in an olympic game or world cup soccer game which team would you cheer for
1911282 a stiff apology is a second insult the injured party does not want to be compensated because he has been wronged he wants to be healed because he has been hurt

1911290 they did a good job of calling timeouts or substituting when there was a free throw
1911291 usually on a free throw we get the ball and take off and run
1911292 russia is a team we could see in the gold medal game and a team thats been playing very well of late so it was good competition they made us run some sets slow us down a little bit but i think overall we played good defense

1911300 the meeting ran from 2pm to 4pm which basically excluded anyone who worked normal business hours of the 40 i would say 35 or so were opposed to the noise ordinance this i know because they had a show of hands first for and then against it looked like there were 3 or 4 bar owners present a number of musicians and some downtown residents
1911301 some suggestions were offered to the city allow a higher decibel level on friday and saturday nights change the 65db allowed time from 10pm to 11pm create an entertainment district with no db limits the city seemed receptive to the first two suggestions not so much the third
1911302 i came away from the meeting with a little better education on noise issues and an impression that perhaps the city would be somewhat flexible if and when they adopt the downtown noise ordinance there current proposal is more lenient than the state standard the standard adopted by seattle and tacoma or so we were told i feel if they were to allow 65db on friday and saturdays after 10pm it would be a lot easier to work with im not optimistic that the noise ordinance can be stopped just hopeful that in its final draft it can be somewhat reasonable and fair to both downtown residents and the nightclubs

1911362 when we behold a wide turf covered expanse we should remember that its smoothness on which so much of its beauty depends is mainly due to all the inequalities having been slowly levelled by worms it is a marvellous reflection that the whole of the superficial mould over any such expanse has passed and will again pass every few years through the bodies of worms the plough is one of the most ancient and most valuable of mans inventions but long before he existed the land was in fact regularly ploughed and still continues to be thus ploughed by earth worms it may be doubted whether there are many other animals which have played so important a part in the history of the world as have these lowly organized creatures
1911363 jerusalem the state department has for a second time in two months reneged on its offer to three palestinians in gaza to study in the united states on fulbright grants this time citing unspecified security concerns the three were part of a group of seven fulbright winners whose grants were first withdrawn at the end of may when the state department feared it would be unable to get them out of gaza because of israels closing of the coastal strip which the israelis say is aimed at isolating the hamas leadership there when secretary of state condoleezza rica heard about the withdrawals she declared fulbright grants to be an important part of american foreign policy and the scholarships were reinstated the students needed to undergo individual israeli security checks in order to leave gaza and travel first to the american consulate in jerusalem for a visa interview and then to fly out four of the seven were cleared but three were told by israel that they were security risks and could not enter the country skeptical american officials asked for details but said they only got broad accusations of links to hamas the officials still wanted to offer the grants the consulate brought from washington high priced mobile fingerprinting equipment and sent several officials to the israel gaza border to interview the three palestinians on july 10 three weeks later on july 30 all three were informed that they had cleared the security screening and were granted their visas two days later the visas were revoked although not before israel allowed one of the grantees fidaa abed to leave gaza to fly to washington unaware of his changed status he was informed at the airport that his visa was no longer valid flown back to amman jordan and instructed to return to gaza he remains in amman on monday the american consulate in jerusalem sent letters to mr abed and the two other grantees still in gaza saying information has come to light that you may be inadmissible to the united states and therefore their visas were being revoked in washington gonzalo gallegos a state department spokesman declined to get into specifics but said that the visas were revoked because we got more information about the grantees a senior state department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that ms rice was very unhappy about how these cases had been handled and that a thorough review had been ordered to prevent a recurrence the official added that the latest information about the three palestinians was enough to give pause but that we really have to scrub it and are now going to take a good look to see if it holds israeli officials who had insisted that the three posed a risk expressed satisfaction that their message had gotten through a senior israeli official said that after the united states had granted the visas the process of israeli american contacts on the matter did not cease and more specific information was provided of the four gaza fulbright winners who were permitted to leave three are in the united states already one dropped out of the program the night before her departure because she did not want to give up her current lectureship in gaza taghreed el khodary contributed reporting from gaza and helene cooper from washington

1911467 several people have left comments on this board and one over at macrumors com saying that they had a cable that had been working with their original iphones not 3g before the 2 0 software update but then stopped working after the 2 0 update could it be a software firmware issue the fact that we are seeing some video out capability to the tv even if just for a minute or so before the iphone stops playing the video implies to me that it is a firmware or software issue which could potentially be fixed with the next software update
1911468 the composite cable doesnt work for the iphone 3g as the pinout is totally different therefor all cables have to be checked for compatibility by apple first and then getting redesigned when the composite tv cable for the iphone3g will come we dont know

1911480 we re not gonna lie to you fans things are bad all over for quality horror cinema a recent article at moviemaker com pointed the current ills of the genre but let me expand on just how bad the problem is and possible solutions to the problem as the article pointed out young horror directors are having trouble cracking the horror audience the old guard directors like george romero although beloved by this commentator can t put butts on the theater seats and hollywood doesn t care about the discerning horror fan instead delivering forgettable terrible pg 13 horror flops one after another americanizations and remakes are disappointing fans all over the board and for the enterprising indie horror filmmaker chances are that your well crafted smart horror flick just won t be released theatrically regardless of how many awards you win of how much fan buzz your film garners

1911486 rielle told me she had a secret affair with edwards when she found out that she was pregnant she said he was the father
1911487 rielle told me while andrew young is a friend shes not romantically involved with him
1911488 if there is not an explanation thats satisfactory acceptable and meets high moral standards the answer is no he would not be a prime candidate to make a major address to the convention
1911489 boy you skip a day on the john edwards rielle hunter non story and you miss a lot of non news
1911490 who was this man of character and decency we all loved and trusted after all we are asking ourselves sadly we just thought we knew the guy we didnt live and learn its never good to put our heros up on a pedestal lest we place our own selves in a vulnerable position
1911491 i wasnt planning to blog the story otherwise but honestly the more i look at that blur the more it looks like a photoshop filter
1911492 i now have added another question to my list how did they get a picture of him and the baby in the room
1911493 i cant really tell if the photos are genuine based on the small clip online and im surprised the enquirer hasnt posted more than a couple of images but theyre there
1911494 gee do you think the leftist american media could start reporting on this major political scandal yet it is an absolute disgrace that the mainstream media remains silent the national enquirer continues to do the hard journalism the mainstream media refuses to do
1911495 the real scandal wasnt that edwards fathered a baby while married to a cancer stricken wife it was the monolithic refusal of the american mainstream press to even investigate the facts of the story which were with the application of a little legwork easy enough for them to investigate after edwards was caught by the enquirers reporters at the beverly hilton at 2 40 in the morning july 22 the reason for not reporting was theres no confirmation when foxnews confirmed the run in by interviewing one of the hotel security guards involved the reason shifted to we want to see pictures but outside of a few dailies and a few mentions at foxnews there was none customers of cnn cbs nbc abc the new york times time newsweek and the la times where lats blogs editor tony pearce infamously and specifically ordered his reporters not to blog on the topic are still in the dark
1911496 will the los angeles times now deem the story newsworthy or will they like other big media outlets continue to embargo the story because theyve decided that it isnt worth our time to read about edwards conduct and marital infidelities my thoughts and prayers go out to elizabeth edwards and her children may she take john for every last penny however bloggers are reporting on this and it further underscores the fact that the public can and will continue to rely more on alternative news sources because they have had it with the media elites who determine what stories should fly and which ones get buried
1911497 why write about the edwards scandal heres a short clip n save response to those including many friends who argue the edwards scandal shouldnt be pursued or at least pursued too vigorously even if it is true
1911498 ok were not hiring him because of his sterling private behavior
1911499 the only legitimate reason not to cover this scandal it seems to me is simple sympathy for elizabeth edwards and ive gotten enough emails from anguished and angry members of the msm to conclude with estrich that its the prime reason for the msm blackout reporters dont have to print everything you could conclude that the need to protect mrs edwards her children is so great the karma of enquiring so bad that all of the obvious public interesty reasons for covering the story should be thrown out the window and if john edwards were already so damaged that in practice hed never get a significant public office even if he wants one i might agree but thats a point that clearly hasnt been reached yet a man arrogant and ambitious enough to think he can run for president posing as a loyal husband while keeping his second family secret will be arrogant and ambitious enough to keep hiding under the shield of his wifes illness until he can attempt a comeback if given the chance
1911500 its on the verge of going big time very big time
1911501 the mcclatchy article proceeds to describe how edwards rather than explaining the situation has been avoiding reporters it is appearing that such stonewalling will not work much longer as reputable news sources such as mcclatchy are picking up the story despite showing initial reluctance
1911502 mcclatchys raleigh news amp observer which unlike other newspapers has never declared itself too good for the john edwards love child scandal is first with the angle that will probably at long last propel the sordid tale into the times and washington post and basically everywhere edwards presumed speaking slot at the convention which
1911503 he absolutely does have to resolve it if its not true he has to issue a stronger denial
1911504 its a very damaging thing the big media has tried to be responsible and handle this with kid gloves but its clearly getting ready to bust out if its not true hes got to stand up and say this is not true that is not my child and im going to take legal action against the people who are spreading these lies its not enough to say thats tabloid trash
1911505 oh yes the buttoned down media will soon be lapping this story up with a spoon see previously the edwards scandal was just an irrelevant trifle about how the maybe next u s attorney general or even vice president had a baby with another woman while his wife died of cancer and possibly paid the mistress hush money and lied to everyone about it but now its about how a speaker at a meaningless convention might distract the media from covering the media event in the way media handlers prefer in other words a real story
1911506 no way no how can the msm ignore this story if he is ousted from his speaker role at the convention they can spin it anyone they want but the simple fact that the story is so controversial that it prevents him from speaking should wake the msm up from their slumber
1911507 dems do what msm wont they are asking about the love child of democrat john edwards when edwards is not in denver later this month i wonder how abc cbs cnn fox msnbc nbc and pbs will explain his absence

1911509 we geloven dat terroristen mogelijk van plan zijn aanslagen te plegen in de vae
1911510 wij geloven dat terroristen een aanslag voorbereiden in de emiraten momenteel is er een hoog alarm maar de meeste alarmen gaan omhoog en naar beneden we adviseren geen britse onderdanen op dit moment om hun reisplannen te wijzigen aanvallen kunnen echter zonder enig onderscheid plaatsvinden en op elk ogenblik
1911511 steeds meer vlamingen worden moslim en zij hebben problemen om de gebeden in een marokkaanse turkse of pakistaanse moskee te volgen ons initiatief is er dan ook in de eerste plaats voor deze bekeerlingen gekomen uiteraard richten wij ons ook op allochtonen die geen voeling meer hebben met de taal van hun voorouders marokkaanse jongeren hebben er niets aan om naar een marokkaanse moskee te gaan als zij zich eerder belg voelen in de nieuwe moskee zal het gebed nog altijd in de heilige taal het arabisch verlopen alle overige dingen zoals het vrijdagsgebed zouden wel in het nederlands gebeuren
1911512 wij staan wel open voor mensen die ge nteresseerd zijn in onze godsdienst in samenwerking met het vlaams islamitisch centrum bieden wij de mensen informatie zodat zij voor zichzelf een oordeel kunnen vellen over de islam
1911513 een nederlandstalige moskee lijkt mij zeker een goed idee als ik naar de jongste generatie binnen onze gemeenschap kijk dan moet ik vaststellen dat zij inderdaad niet z veel banden meer hebben met de taal van hun voorouders voor hen is een nederlandstalige moskee dus zeker welkom ik denk ook dat belgen ons beter zouden begrijpen als zij zelf de mogelijkheid zouden hebben om onze diensten te volgen misschien zouden zij dan inzien dat de islam gewoon een godsdienst is zoals het christendom waar zij niet bang voor hoeven te zijn
1911514 de vlaming op de straat staat eerder onverschillig tegenover de komst van een nederlandstalige moskee de meesten geloven niet dat er werkelijk veel vlamingen zich tot de islam bekeren maar ze zien geen probleem in het ontstaan van een nederlandstalige moskee sommigen geloven wel dat deze moskee ervoor kan zorgen dat allochtone moslims vlotter nederlands zullen leren zo zullen er inderdaad minder vooroordelen tegenover moslims zijn aldus de vlaming

1911521 its fascinating to watch barack obama change his opinions on the u s troop surge in iraq heres a combo a los angeles times report on deletions of obamas previous anti surge position on his web site plus a youtube video showing his flip flops on the issue

1911530 at a time when the surge appears to be working is that the right time to try and set time tables for withdrawing all american troops
1911531 and you pull out according to that time table regardless of the situation even if theres serious sectarian violence
1911532 ten years ago when obama was running for statewide office in an exclusive chicago district he opposed the death penalty he now supports the ultimate penalty
1911533 during the recent obama pander tour the presumptive democratic nominee unnecessarily endorsed president bushs faith based initiative a sort of patronage program that rewards religious activists for their political support with public grants

1911536 barack obama aligned himself with welfare reform on monday launching a television ad which touts the way the overhaul
1911537 contradicting what obama said at the debate the old footage shows the senator saying
1911538 i never said that we should try to go ahead and get single payer single payer healthcare is an euphemism for socialized medicine
1911539 many on the right of the political spectrum welcomed obamas remarks at aipac but the clarification of his position left several cold
1911540 barack obama has returned to the no preconditions policy for meeting with mahmoud ahmadinejad according to obama foreign policy adviser anthony lake financial times also discovered in its interview with lake that obama has reversed himself on iraq now saying that the withdrawal is off

1912017 id like to give you a piece of my mind
1912018 before you hire a company to build a house you would i expect insist on detailed plans showing what the finished structure was going to look like building a childs mind and character is what public schools do their justification for prematurely breaking family and neighborhood learning where is documentary evidence to prove this assumption that trained and certified professionals do it better than people who know and love them can there isnt any the cost in new york state for building a well schooled child in the year 2000 is 200 000 per body when lost interest is calculated that capital sum invested in the childs name over the past twelve years would have delivered a million dollars to each kid as a nest egg to compensate for having no school the original 200 000 is more than the average home in new york costs you wouldnt build a home without some idea what it would look like when finished but you are compelled to let a corps of perfect strangers tinker with your childs mind and personality without the foggiest idea what they want to do with it

1912022 most people do not have a clue how many calories they are taking in when they have a milkshake or a double hamburger with cheese and fries
1912023 this is an incentive for people to make the right dietary choices
1912024 all three of these policies are forms of second guessing consumers
1912025 if there was an overwhelming demand for conspicuous calorie counts then businesses would respond to that the fact that you dont see it indicates that they are not really clamoring to have that information thrust in their faces
1912026 our clients are pretty sophisticated they want to have this information
1912027 our food is pretty clean to begin with our nutritional analyses will prove to be very good
1912028 its not intuitive thats why we have to give people this information my hope is that it will help them change their food choices people are still going to eat out but hopefully they will make good choices
1912029 people dont want to be fat or obese left to their own devices people want to be healthy

1912036 most hpv infections are cleared spontaneously recent research using available molecular detection technologies suggests that clearance occurs within one year for about 70 per cent of those infected and within two years for 90 per cent thus hpv infection and cervical cancer must not be conflated most women who are infected with even a high risk strain of hpv will not develop cervical cancer
1912037 there are twice as many children collapsing and four times as many children experiencing tingling numbness and loss of sensation after getting gardasil vaccination compared to those getting a tdap tetanus diphtheria acellular pertussis vaccination
1912038 there have been reports of facial paralysis and guillain barre syndrome and doctors who give gardasil in combination with other vaccines are basically conducting an experiment on their young patients because merck has not published any safety data for simultaneous vaccination with any vaccine except hepatitis b vaccine

1912071 then moses brought aaron and his sons forward and washed them with water
1912072 oh that you would rend the heavens and come down
1912073 the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom
1912074 and the spirit of god was hovering over the waters
1912075 at once the spirit sent him out into the desert
1912076 god made him who had no sin to be sin for us so that we might become the righteousness of god
1912077 we have one a high priest who has been tempted in every way just as we are yet was without sin
1912078 americans recognize that the two democrats and the two republicans who actually have a shot at being president will not rock the boat they may also realize that the four mens quarrels on the issues voters care most about health care education social security medicare are mostly modest differences about highly incremental means not ends the old bold ideological polarities big government programs from democrats big government cutbacks from republicans have been sanded down in the clinton era foreign policy issues arent even on the table
1912079 given four contenders so eager to hug the center conventional wisdom has it that this election is a battle over character hence the endless dissection of smirks and sighs and the constant lookout for this years magic balm authenticity
1912080 the increasingly inevitable story line that the political press has feared from the start that this might actually be a bush gore horse race may be far less boring than the alternative narratives that have been trotted out to try to upend it
1912081 eight months to go but hey whos counting and were stranded with two establishment tightly scripted often robotic candidates who are about as different from one another as j crew and banana republic both are wealthy ivy league educated boomers who took safe paths through the vietnam war whose career advancement was greased by their dads who advertise their intimacy with jesus who reek of smarmy soft money and who will do anything to win whether it be mr gores lying about his own congressional voting record in a debate or mr bushs heartless exploitation of womens fears of breast cancer in a scurrilous attack ad
1912082 surveying the bush gore field cbss straight talking bob schieffer spoke for the desperation of many when he remarked in language as plaintive as samuel becketts we have got four months now until the convention
1912083 the great hope for surprises in the eight months ahead is mr
1912084 like a deadening cushion that will soften absorb or deflect any rhetorical weapons that al gore might hurl at bush
1912085 the texas governor has even managed to play down his role as the countrys lord high executioner by suppressing the smirk and invoking the deity once gary graham was dead
1912086 the real problem for mr gore this year isnt clinton fatigue its gore fatigue and you feel it almost every time he opens his mouth whether in small groups or large on the record or off the hyper cautious vice president has trouble speaking plainly and candidly when trying to further his views or his candidacy most americans recognize that he is both far more experienced in and knowledgeable about government than governor bush few confuse his private life with bill clintons polls show that americans agree with mr gores positions on most issues and love the economy but it all may be for naught for a candidate who not only tells you how to build a watch when you ask what time it is but is still talking after youve nodded off
1912087 an anti hussein hawk who was among the rare senate democrats to vote for the first gulf war mr
1912088 but in truth as with global warming mr gores stands on iraq both in 1991 and 2002 were manifestations of leadership the single attribute most missing from the current democrats with presidential ambitions
1912089 now that mr kerry enters the final stretch of 2004 with a serious chance of unseating an incumbent in wartime a competing theory also rises its possible for america to overdose on entertainment
1912090 just like you are planning for your future and your family one day by doing what you have to do i am trying to do the same

1912095 ligeti one of the most original and important musical thinkers of our time first came to prominence during the 1960s
1912096 concert rom nesc however is an early work written in 1951 while ligeti was still living in communist hungary
1912097 not everything in it is genuinely romanian as i also invented elements in the spirit of the village bands
1912098 the four short movements of concert rom nesc follow one another without pause
1912099 it was forced into the straitjacket of the norms of socialist realism
1912100 people living in the west cannot begin to imagine what it was like in the soviet empire where art and culture were strictly regulated as a matter of course they had to conform to abstract concepts that were almost identical to the regulations of the national socialists art had to be healthy and edifying and had to come from the people in short it had to reflect party directives
1912101 gy rgy ligeti the greatest of transylvanian composers once wrote a po me symphonique for one hundred metronomes
1912102 the po me symphonique is ligeti in a nutshell he is first of all one of the few major composers modern or ancient who are notable for a sense of humor
1912103 if ligeti were nothing more than a joker he would never have reached his perch at the summit of contemporary music
1912104 i am using only an idea from african notions of movement not the music itself in africa cycles or periods of constantly equal length are supported by a regular beat which is usually danced not played the individual beat can be divided into two three sometimes even four or five elementary units or fast pulses i employ neither the cyclic form nor the beats but use rather the elementary pulse as an underlying gridwork i use this principle in d sordre for accent shifting which allows illusory pattern deformations to emerge the pianist plays a steady rhythm but the irregular distribution of accents leads to seemingly chaotic configurations another fundamental characteristic of african music was significant to me the simmultaneity of symmetry and asymmetry the cycles are always structured asymmetrically e g twelve pulses in 7 5 although the beat as conceived by the musician proceeds in even pulses
1912105 i sit down to the piano regularly at nine oclock in the morning and mesdames les muses have learned to be on time for that rendezvous
1912106 mozart marks the slow movement adagio instead of the more common andante what he has to say cant be rushed this magnificent and justly famous music stands alone among all mozart concerto movements not only because of its tempo or key its his only work in f sharp minor but also because it unlocks a tragic power that wont surface in music again until beethoven the wind writing is particularly expressive and the piano solo is as simple and haunting as any slow aria even in figaro with its celebrated mixture of laughter and tears theres scarcely a moment that plunges so deeply into the heart the finale a buoyant and delightful rondo brings us back to a major and after the adagios revelations it sounds like the happiest key on earth
1912107 a tragic power that wont surface in music again until beethoven
1912108 the emphasis in k 482 the one mozart composed just before the one on this concert is on bravura writing may be contrasted with the much more gentle nature of k 488 in a the one played on the concert lacking its predecessors trumpet and drums and i would add oboes this concerto draws on another softer range of tone colours of a piece with its graceful themes the adagio second movement mozarts only f sharp minor movement is famous for its poetry and its pathos derived from its gently falling phrases siciliana rhythm neapolitan harmony and expressive woodwind writing
1912109 this is energy week on the campaign trail i n honor of the critical nature of the debate lets try to clear our heads of all thoughts of paris hilton ads and questions of whether mccain knew when he expressed a yen to see his wife compete in the bikers miss buffalo chip beauty contest that the contestants frequently went topless
1912110 much of the energy policy dnt debate has focused on offshore drilling
1912111 who desperately want a president who will adhere firmly to his positions even when they become totally irrational
1912112 through constant repetition hes trying to fool the public into believing their gas prices will come down in the foreseeable future if more coastal areas are opened to drilling and nobody really believes that including john mccain bad candidate
1912113 mr mccains gambit seems nonetheless to be working public support for ending restrictions on drilling has risen sharply with roughly
1912114 nobody really believes that im not qualified to judge whether mccain really does but whatever demographic sources krugman was looking at alas he doesnt cite his sources strongly suggest otherwise quite a few people believe that
1912115 hes got a new plan for tapping the strategic oil reserves thats even more meaningless than offshore drilling and his position on nuclear power seems to boil down to an intense desire to change the subject
1912116 1997 verlie er wien und lebt seither in berlin und los angeles
1912117 id imagine that there was a time when someone told barack obama thats just the way it is some things would never change
1912118 and though it seems heaven sent we aint ready to see a black president
1912119 these are people who with modern therapies can be kept out of trouble
1912120 a lot of people are suffering from a lack of health insurance
1912121 for some of the 11 4 million uninsured americans with serious chronic conditions access to care seems to be unobtainable many may face early disability and death as a result
1912122 you may have won the battle but you lost the war
1912123 smile why dont you smile its such a lovely day
1912124 well the biggest thing has been how hard it is to swallow all your feminist bents when all the men are like yes please and whatever when you walk by them they just want you to buy their shit but theyd never never dare say so much as an unsolicited how are you to a local woman or an obviously muslim middle eastern woman so mostly you just want to turn around and go fuck you buddy lay off but you know they wont get it
1912125 you cannot people watch its impossible except for kids and women
1912126 making art and looking at art keeps my brain running and hopefully also somebody elses interested in my art
1912127 an artist is a person who creates art some artists dont regard themselves as artists to me what i do is not special in any way i am not especially talented or intelligent what i do anybody can do its not like painting that requires some techniques i could write down what i do and send the instructions to someone else and he can do just the same that is the concept of being a conceptual artist
1912128 art has to be regarded as art by the artist its a naming game in that sense as soon as you can regard something as art it is art things become art when they start to communicate when they become a picture of something else even provoke a discussion about something or a feeling it can be in a musical sense a good book or a film that makes you think making you wonder about things making you think new things that others didnt think before you
1912129 what i work with is just a bunch of ideas but it has to be an idea that keeps me thinking that keeps me investigating and looking at pages on the internet until the point i can show it to somebody else and provoke their interest maybe i make them do their own investigation
1912130 suppose someone were to claim that there is a form of prejudice called anti kiwism an irrational hatred of new zealanders
1912131 what might convince us he was right criticism of the new zealand government no a denial of new zealands right to exist maybe seven thousand terrorist attacks on new zealands citizens in the past year possibly a series of claims at the un conference against racism in durban that new zealand because of its treatment of the maori is uniquely guilty of apartheid ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity accompanied by grotesque nazi style posters perhaps a call to murder all those with new zealand loyalties although they were born and live elsewhere a suggestion that new zealanders control the worlds economy that they are responsible for aids and poisoning water supplies that they arranged the september 11 attack on the world trade center that they are a satanic force of evil against whom a holy war must be fought
1912132 delete new zealand and insert israel and jews and all these things have happened in the past year
1912133 what more has to happen before an impartial observer concludes that anti semitism is alive and well and dangerous
1912134 our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate but that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that frightens us
1912135 if we choose leaders based on charisma rather than character why then are we surprised when we end up with that kind of leadership
1912136 entendemos que la delincuencia hay que enfrentarle en cualquier plano esperamos que los buenos ciudadanos comprendan que aunando esfuerzos ministerio p blico y dem s autoridades conjuntamente con la sociedad civil logremos vencer este flagelo que nos perjudica a todos

1912157 clinton trails in sic barack obama in every meaningful metric of the democratic nomination fight she has fewer pledged delegates and superdelegates has won fewer states and trails in the popular vote unless of course michigan and florida are included in that count all of which begs the question why does she go on
1912158 its a question that cant be fully answered by anyone but clinton
1912159 several democratic party operatives consultants and other politicos to answer the why question
1912160 their thoughts ranged from the obvious she wants to see the race through to the machiavellian she is positioning herself to run again in four years time if obama loses

1912165 it is clear from the context that hillary was invoking a familiar political circumstance in order to support her decision to stay in the race through june i understand how highly charged the atmosphere is but i think it is a mistake for people to take offense

1912201 my guess is that the atheism debate is going to be a sideshow the cognitive revolution is not going to end up undermining faith in god its going end up challenging faith in the bible
1912202 over the past several years the momentum has shifted away from hard core materialism the brain seems less like a cold machine it does not operate like a computer instead meaning belief and consciousness seem to emerge mysteriously from idiosyncratic networks of neural firings those squishy things called emotions play a gigantic role in all forms of thinking love is vital to brain development
1912203 meaning belief and consciousness seem to emerge mysteriously from idiosyncratic networks of neural firings
1912204 andrew newberg of the university of pennsylvania has shown that transcendent experiences can actually be identified and measured in the brain people experience a decrease in activity in the parietal lobe which orients us in space the mind seems to have the ability to transcend itself and merge with a larger presence that feels more real
1912205 first the self is not a fixed entity but a dynamic process of relationships
1912206 second underneath the patina of different religions people around the world have common moral intuitions third people are equipped to experience the sacred to have moments of elevated experience when they transcend boundaries and overflow with love
1912207 fourth god can best be conceived as the nature one experiences at those moments the unknowable total of all there is
1912208 the real challenge is going to come from people who feel the existence of the sacred but who think that particular religions are just cultural artifacts built on top of universal human traits
1912209 a former governor of west virginia bob wise came by my office to talk about a prosaic matter the terrible job that the nation is doing in getting its high school kids ready for the real world

1912211 international comparisons rank the united states a stunningly unimpressive eighteenth for high school graduation rates a lackluster ranking of fifteenth for high school reading assessments among 15 year olds in developed countries and an embarrassing 25th for high school math

1912213 senator mccain never bothered to mention how we were to reach this wondrous state and he bristled when a reporter suggested he was offering a magic carpet ride
1912214 to maintain its standing as an economic power the united states must encourage programs that help students achieve the highest levels in math and science especially in poor communities where the teacher corps is typically weak
1912215 the national academies the countrys leading science advisory group has called for an ambitious program to retrain current teachers in these disciplines and attract 10 000 new ones each year for the foreseeable future
1912216 a new study from a federal research center based at the urban institute in washington suggests that the country might raise student performance through programs like teach for america a nonprofit group that places high achieving college graduates in schools that are hard to staff
1912217 critics have challenged the programs usefulness pointing out that the teachers it places are neophytes and that a majority leave the classroom after two years but the new study suggests that talented young people can have a lasting effect even if they do not make a career of teaching according to the study teach for america participants who worked in north carolina between 2000 and 2006 had more impact on student performance than traditional teachers did as measured by end of course tests the difference was observed in several areas of science and was strongest in math

1912244 most of the major key judgments in the intelligence communitys october 2002 national intelligence estimate nie iraqs continuing programs for weapons of mass destruction either overstated or were not supported by the underlying intelligence reporting a series of failures particularly in analytic trade craft led to the mischaracterization of the intelligence
1912245 the report is left to complain about implications and statements that left the impression that those contacts led to substantive iraqi cooperation
1912246 simply stated there is no doubt that saddam hussein now has weapons of mass destruction there is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends against our allies and against us
1912247 intelligence is an uncertain business even in the best of circumstances
1912248 intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised
1912249 why does it matter at this late date the rockefeller report will not cause a spike in bush lied mug sales and the bond dissent will not lead anyone to scrape the bush lied bumper sticker off his or her car
1912250 distracts from the biggest prewar failure the fact that so much of the intelligence upon which bush and rockefeller and everyone else relied turned out to be tragically catastrophically wrong
1912251 c reported on his recent talks in washington there was a perceptible shift in attitude military action was now seen as inevitable bush wanted to remove saddam through military action justified by the conjunction of terrorism and wmd but the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy the nsc had no patience with the un route and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the iraqi regimes record there was little discussion in washington of the aftermath after military action
1912252 after all it was not bush but rockefeller who said in october 2002 there has been some debate over how
1912253 republican senators filed a minority dissent that includes many other such statements from democratic senators who had access t o the intelligence reports that bush read
1912254 no more than six senators and a handful of house members read beyond the five page national intelligence estimate executive summary according to several congressional aides responsible for safeguarding the classified material
1912255 graham said in a national public radio interview in june 2007 that he found the report to be pocked with dissent conditions and minority opinions on a variety of critical issues
1912256 its not at all clear that more lawmakers would have doubted it had they read the full report the unclassified portions do make clear that not all intelligence agencies agreed on all points
1912257 i hope that by voting on this resolution now while the negotiations at the united nations are continuing this resolution will show to the world that the american people are united in our resolve to deal with the iraqi threat and it will strengthen the hand of the administration in making a final effort to try to get the u n to deal with this issue given the difficulty of trying to build a coalition in the united nations i could not in good conscience tie the presidents hands

1912285 but here is the difference between mccain and obama and obama had better pay attention mccain is a known commodity its not just that hes been around a long time and staked out positions antithetical to those of his republican base its also and more important that we know his bottom line as his north vietnamese captors found out there is only so far he will go and then his pride or his sense of honor takes over this not just his candor and nonstop verbosity on the straight talk express is what commends him to so many journalists
1912286 in some recent magazine articles i and certain of my colleagues have been accused of being soft on mccain forgiving him his flips his flops and his mostly conservative ideology
1912287 there is only so far he will go and then his pride or his sense of honor takes over
1912288 a presidential race is only incidentally about issues its really about likability and character obama is to paraphrase what he said about hillary clinton more than likable enough but the character question hangs not because of any evidence to the contrary and not in any moral sense either but because he is still young and lacks the job references mccain picked up in a north vietnamese prison mccain has a bottom line obama just moved his

1912306 al gore is the greatest thinker of our time the guy invented the internet for crying out loud

1912308 i agree it would round out the r sum of prince algorino in the opening scene if he were to sing about his creation of a communications network but the mio magnifico internet aria you propose seems to me a distraction and frankly out of place in an 18th century tuscan village i believe the peasants choral celebration of prince algorinos wisdom suffices to establish his virtues

1912392 i offer my support for stem cell research and to tell you im in favor of new legislation to allow the ethical use of therapeutic cloning like you i support a complete ban on reproductive cloning however i believe that embryonic stem cell research under appropriate guidelines may provide our scientists with many answers that are now beyond our grasp
1912393 studies have been done to show that stem cells come from adult cells and that adult stem cells have the same capabilities as embryonic stem cells
1912394 despite adult stem cell treatments not being available for years it will eventually end a pointless controversy

1912401 i think it is an important step that the gravity of the situation has been recognized and that there are some steps in place to turn the tide in afghanistan
1912402 whether that is successful or not is of course an open question
1912403 in terms of milestones its important to point out that no casualty is more significant than any other
1912404 each service member is equally precious and each loss of life is equally tragic
1912405 the reported presence in afghanistan of the head of al qaeda in iraq underscores the extent to which blowback from iraq is being felt in afghanistan
1912406 at this point leadership seems to be looking at the afghan theater as the next big thing
1912407 the size of the operation and the ability of the group to get support within the town was somewhat alarming and it shows that there is clearly some concern with local afghans and thats a concern because civilians are the center of gravity in a counterinsurgency
1912408 the dangerous message is that there was involvement by the civilians
1912409 iraq and afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle but we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multi dimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism

1912480 you need to stop what you are doing on the web
1912481 what the fuck who do you think you are telling me what i can do
1912482 tom im just giving you some good advice you should take my advice tom
1912483 they are reaching down so far to get someone who just runs web site
1912484 it says that i am going to come again and build the tabernacle of david and restore all the breaches so that wholeness to the gentiles and nations can come in this is no more interuptions in the move of god god becoming more tangible his glory about to be revealed
1912485 the move that god is after is the inheritance of jesus most of us dont even think about it jesus has an inheritance psalm 2 says
1912486 so were now coming to this era of the apostolic the apostolic is all about a final governing presense in the body of christ and that governing anointing is released
1912487 really in its root it means the navy the greek the roman the phoenician navy the apostolic was an admiral on the ship who went and colonised something in other words you had the apostolic is a colonising force that reproduces the culture of a conquering kingdom
1912488 the power of that is this when you agree with god on where he is going you get access to an anointing to get there fast
1912489 so i want to agree with god that the glory the miracles the signs the wonders the resurrections are evidence of the intangible god who is now making a tangible statement that he is here and that glory is about to show up in places that its never penetrated
1912490 and we need to start seeing daniels rising up in babylon that have that anointing that supernatural anointing to get a hold of heaven to wrestle with principalities
1912491 they had a hundred fold anointing of the glory of god huh and this is based on daniel 1 when it came to the beauty industry to sports to athletics to movies to cultural commentary to social behaviour to kings palaces the economics they were a people who could invade every sphere with the glory of god thats where i believe this is going okay perfect people only nazi eugenics heil peter wagner master race i get it do you read this this is troubling if you are not good looking by worldy standards fit atheletic really intelligent a good talker then you are not super anointed wow how do they explain todd bentley then i mean really even they admit basically the guy is dumb uneducated coarse and unattractive so they blatantly contradict themselves because he is meant to be one of the most anointed of the new breed out there and he is over age by their standards apostolically if you are on your assignment youre indestructable when paul was on a ship going in the wrong direction the spheres of government and military and the owner of the ship all got together and they said the religious fanatic says we should not go somewhere but the economy the military the owner of the ship all said lets do it the spheres got together oh boy talk about distortion they took off against the voice of god you know what happened they hit a crisis that nobody could get out of paul said sirs you should have listened to me but an angel of the god whose i am and whom i serve came and told me i have an appointment in rome to talk to nero so im getting delivered and hes saving all of you as part of the deal in other words they were thrown in as a package to paul because paul had an assignment to finish your argument with death is not that you want to live but that you have an assignment to finish there of course is a huge difference between ones true assigmment from god and a false antichrist one basically lance is saying the apostles and their undiscerning mass following are indestructible and the spheres better align or get shipwrecked and in pauls case going to kings was just ordinary he appeared to kings i do not know why we forget kings how many kings though and when and what was his focus what a distortion kings are the effluent power figures at the top of the mountains in the arts industry they are the directors and the producers in wall street they are the business tycoons and corporate ceos and the gospel goes to kings really first you what the gospel goes to kings really first what a distortion and misunderstanding the star of bethlehem drew those kings it took them not right to the manger but took them right to herod take the glory where its never been to the top of the mountains because thats an apostolic assignment that will bring jesus inheritance into the earth
1912492 as far as a connection its definitely too early in the investigation to tell

1912521 despite the growing interest in religion in the united states most churchgoers in america perhaps most churchgoers worldwide seem never to have read the bible
1912522 people who study the bible and think for themselves as jesus commanded luke 12 57 are impossible to manipulate and control
1912523 the results of this vast ignorance and vast unbelief for one cannot believe what one does not know are all around us the militant atheist writer sam harris a gullible man who apparently believes every opinion poll he reads but not the bible informs us that 80 percent of the american people believe the bible is the inspired and inerrant word of god the statement is ludicrous eighty percent is 240 million americans it is an exaggeration to say that even eight percent of the american people believe the bible is inspired and inerrant twenty four million bible believing christians the salt of the earth would transform american society but american society has not been transformed at least not for the better instead american civilization is rapidly disappearing the churches and people harris describes as true believers are actually true apostates having more in common with harris worldly philosophy than with the bibles teaching

1912542 there is no doubt that we should aim to limit changes in the global mean surface temperature to 2c above pre industrial
1912543 but given this is an ambitious target and we dont know in detail how to limit greenhouse gas emissions to realise a 2 degree target we should be prepared to adapt to 4c
1912544 so even if we get the best possible global agreement to reduce greenhouse gasses on any rational basis you should be preparing for a 20 risk so i think bob watson is quite right to put up the figure of 4 degrees
1912545 my own feeling is that if we get to a 4 degree rise it is quite possible that we would begin to see a runaway increase
1912546 no other single factor focussed the minds of the cabinet more than the analysis that i produced through that we begin to have to talk about ordered retreat from some areas of britain because it becomes impossible to defend
1912547 theres no choice here between adaptation and mitigation we have to do both
1912548 at 4 degrees we are basically into a different climate regime
1912549 i think that is a dangerous mindset to be in thinking through the implications of 4 degrees of warming shows that the impacts are so significant that the only real adaptation strategy is to avoid that at all cost because of the pain and suffering that is going to cost
1912550 there is no science on how we are going to adapt to 4 degrees warming it is actually pretty alarming
1912551 this would allow coal fired power plants that are currently being built to be modular and capable of having carbon capture retrofitted and would show the world that we take the issue of climate change seriously thus demonstrating real leadership without this technology we have a real problem
1912552 this offsetting effect which is equivalent to about 100 parts per million of carbon dioxide will largely disappear if china and india follow the lead of the us and europe in limiting sulphur emissions the cause of acid deposition

1912567 after seeing how powerful abomination was how was hulk able to simply knock him unconscious by choking him with a chain he is left alive so how can something with that kind of strength be safely imprisoned

1912570 r kelly was very instrumental in making a lot of decisions when it came to my records being played on the radio
1912571 he would make a call to the radio station or to the label and say hey this joe record is too hot right now yall sic need to pull that back and they would oblige its incredible that now i get the opportunity to i dont know maybe pay r kelly back in some sort of side bar kind of thing
1912572 im still very relevant in the game but yeah he did try to make some decisions when it came down to my records being on fire and climbing up the charts and on the radio stations he felt like they should pull back because he felt he was more important and with their loyalty to him they obliged

1912591 you cant look at a 30 day period and make a lot of conclusions
1912592 this is not any subversive thing like trying to legalize marijuana or whatever this is just practical agriculture were desperate for something that can make us some money

1912598 they benefited to some degree where a couple of their very important models in their second year on the market the es and the rx which together account for over two thirds of lexus sales both improved significantly
1912599 the lower score is largely due to vehicles that are no longer in the marketplace
1912600 the vehicles are still out there so the study is still relevant but obviously they had some problems
1912601 obviously were disappointed not to have been at the top but as a brand we consistently rank high in many many quality studies
1912602 improved quality is good for everybody its good for the consumer they dont have the annoyance of problems they dont have the costs associated
1912603 for the manufacturer its obviously good news because they dont have to pay so much in warranty repairs
1912604 in todays environment the only concern i have with prius right now is meeting expectations with availability

1912613 offer real solutions to the energy crisis not gimmicks like drilling
1912614 rather than more drilling we need a massive program to switch to affordable clean alternative energy sources and end our dependence on oil
1912615 america must commit to producing 100 of our electricity from cheap clean renewable energy sources like solar and wind within 10 years
1912616 opening the ocs outer continental shelf and anwr for drilling will signal our countrys commitment to produce more oil the markets will respond to this committment and gas prices will fall short term
1912617 no results for 10 years and the idea it would have any immediate effect on oil prices is silly

1912689 outra caiu entre os espinhos e os espinhos cresceram com ela e sufocaram a planta 4 mas outra semente caiu em terra boa e brotou cresceu e produziu fruto trinta vezes sessenta vezes e cem vezes mais o que havia sido semeado
1912690 a semente a palavra de deus os que est o beira do caminho s o os que ouvem mas depois vem o diabo e tira a palavra do seu cora o para que n o acreditem nem sejam salvos
1912691 se o nosso evangelho est encoberto est encoberto para os que est o perdidos nos quais o deus deste mundo o diabo cegou os entendimentos dos que n o cr em para que a luz do glorioso evangelho de cristo n o resplande a sobre eles
1912692 algumas pessoas como as sementes semeadas em ch o pedregoso ouvem a palavra e a princ pio a recebem com alegria mas n o t m raiz e acreditam por um certo tempo mas quando chega a ang stia e a persegui o por causa da palavra logo ficam ofendidas e rapidamente se desviam
1912693 estou com voc s sempre nunca os deixarei nem os desampararei
1912694 outros como a semente semeada entre espinhos ouvem a palavra mas os cuidados e preocupa es desta vida a sedu o das riquezas e o desejo por outras coisas entram e sufocam a palavra tornando os infrut feros
1912695 os que recebem a semente que caiu em terra boa s o os que com um cora o honesto e bom ouvem a palavra e a ret m e com paci ncia produzem fruto trinta sessenta ou cem vezes mais o que foi semeado

1912720 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform
1912721 he represents a significant addition to this franchise and reflects our commitment to putting the best possible product on the field
1912722 we just felt like this was an opportunity for us to go get someone of bretts stature and what hes accomplished
1912723 woody eric head coach eric mangini and i felt that it was in the best interest of the team when the opportunity presented itself we felt it was the right move for us to make and we went ahead and did it
1912724 it was a good conversation were excited about it and were glad he is on the team
1912725 unless something unforeseen happens that looks like where we are going
1912726 mike tannenbaum and his football administration staff did a great job of navigating this complex process
1912727 i am excited about welcoming brett deanna and their family to the jets organization
1912728 brett has had a long and storied career in green bay and the packers owe him a tremendous debt of gratitude for everything he accomplished on the field and for the impact he made in the state
1912729 it is with some sadness that we make this announcement but also with the desire for certainty that will allow us to move the team and organization forward in the most positive way possible
1912730 we respect bretts decision that he could no longer remain here as a packer
1912731 but there were certain things we were not willing to do because they were not in the best interest of the team we were not going to release him nor trade him to a team within the division
1912732 when brett ultimately decided that he still wanted to play football but not in green bay we told him that we would work to find the best solution for all parties involved we wish brett and his family well
1912733 not to imply anything but i dont think the kid weighs forty pounds
1912734 yknow looking at her youd never guess that pamela lee had a baby

1912738 fred at the office passed a stone the size of a pea boy thats gotta hurt
1912739 whoa for a minute there i thought i woke up next to willard scott

1912751 you know now that you mention it you are getting fat and unattractive
1912752 oh this is just great now on top of everything else child support
1912753 i have been thinking i would really like to incorporate a pirouette on pointe whilst standing on your head during our swan lake performance would that be ok
1912754 er ok that sounds very cool but how do we want to be with it if it goes wrong
1912755 good question thank you for asking um well lets look at what could go wrong
1912756 you are right those things could happen but we are both incredibly talented so it is much more likely that we will get tons of kudos and get our performance on you tube so if those things were to happen lets plan firstly lets increase our insurance so we are fully covered two lets get some other safety measures in place maybe we choreograph this so other members of the company can be on alert and break your fall and i will not hold you responsible for hurting me in fact lets promise now that if the worst were to happen we will make sure to keep open lines of communication so both our feelings will be heard oh and i suggest we train an extra 10 hours a week
1912757 all sounds good i love the part about open lines of communication lets ask someone to remind us about that if we are mad at one another maybe we ask third frog man from the left to hold us accountable i do however want to counter offer the 10 hours a week to 8 hours as we already work so hard and in order to keep the focus i would like to have some time during the week to myself too

1912764 a very simple kind of light went on in my head
1912765 it gives the kids a neat foundation for something more than just catching a fish
1912766 the craft is catching fish but the art is knowing the ecosystem and what makes them interconnected
1912767 i just didnt care about school but that book changed my life it was the total absolute turning point it was the real trigger to see the written word could express or re create a similar feeling or events id encountered in my own life

1912779 do you refuse the request of the messenger of allah send me to him for he shall certainly not bring ruin to me
1912780 the prophet heard of her reaction and prayed for her

1912783 he felt responsible for making a difference in this world
1912784 we are just right now concentrating on all the families and our employees
1912785 we are very concerned about them because we are very tight knit
1912786 im so thankful because hes just lucky to be alive

1913362 these findings are in some ways a sad reflection on the way times are changing when you consider that for most people their village is contained within their mobile phone or email contact list rather than the local neighbourhood its hardly surprising that people dont prioritise the personality of the physical community where they live sell property ought to look closely at which attributes in the area match the changing needs of today the research clearly demonstrates physical attributes of a home and local area infrastructure are becoming increasingly important
1913363 the fact that conservatories were one of the least popular attributes may surprise a lot of people however the value of a property is restricted by the average price of property in the area so if your home is already tip top and you add a conservatory to increase value you may not get your money back in short adding a conservatory should be a lifestyle choice

1913367 loyalty should be rewarded but the millions of mortgage customers who have never moved lender are potentially paying a massive price for not searching the market
1913368 the mortgage industry complains bitterly about so called rate tarts but the reality is that two out of five borrowers are far too loyal to their lender many may be deterred by the fear they will have to pay high fees to move but the reality is that they can make significant savings
1913369 our service makes it easier for mortgage customers to compare the true cost of their existing deal with the best out there it helps show the true cost of staying put and the true cost of moving to a different lender we believe that can make the decision easier for borrowers

1913374 we have forecast 3 growth for next year although we expect prices above 5 million to rise by 8 or more during the year on the back of international demand and particularly demand from oil rich and commodity rich countries russia kazakhstan the middle east in particular
1913375 we now expect a slower mortgage market next year although by no means a stagnant one
1913376 most borrowers will cope but not everyone will escape unharmed from the effects of a slower market

1913423 eine beurteilung ist immer schwer man hat oft gesehen dass mannschaften eine katastrophale vorbereitung hatten und dann doch sensationell gestartet sind und es kann auch umgekehrt laufen aber ich habe viel vertrauen in unsere mannschaft
1913424 das werden wir am 23 mai 2009 sehen aber nat rlich ist es f r uns pflicht einen internationalen platz zu erreichen
1913425 da muss man vorsichtig sein es kann alles gut laufen aber schon eine einzige verletzung kann die mannschaft durcheinander bringen daher sollten wir nicht zu weit nach vorne schauen und auch nicht gleich nach einem guten resultat anfangen zu tanzen und zu singen aber klar liebe fans tr umen ist immer erlaubt
1913426 ich werde vitali in die rente zur ckhauen mir dann seinen kleinen bruder schnappen
1913427 gro e spr che ich werde mir m he geben geschichte zu schreiben und zwar das letzte kapitel in der karriere von sam peter da treffen zwei puncher aufeinander der kampf wird sicher nicht ber die runden gehen
1913428 am wochenende treffen wir uns in hamburg besprechen alles ich glaube dass der gro e klitschko traum jetzt endlich in erf llung geht beide werden weltmeister sein
1913429 vitali hat nach seiner bandscheiben op an der r ckenmuskulatur viel gearbeitet im wasser kann man den k rper entlasten und trotzdem kondition aufbauen
1913430 david hat auf mich einen sehr guten eindruck gemacht er ist akzeptiert war f r mich in london der spieler des turniers ich denke es ist eine gute entscheidung
1913431 rost ist eine pers nlichkeit vielleicht die gr te normalerweise ist er der kapit n aber es ist wichtig dass man auf dem platz einen spieler hat
1913432 es ist eine ehre f r mich ich werde versuchen die mannschaft bestm glich zu f hren
1913433 ich werde mich berhaupt nicht ndern und m chte mit meiner art impulse geben
1913434 ich bin es nicht alleine wir haben drei vier leute die f r die anderen vorbild sein k nnen
1913435 david ist ein spieler auf den man sich immer verlassen kann in sachen professionalit t und einstellung vorbildlich er ist kein lautsprecher das wird in der mannschaft und in unserem verein gesch tzt
1913436 silber vor vier jahren empfinde ich heute noch als misserfolg
1913437 jetzt hat sich die zahl der richtig guten spieler bei uns erh ht
1913438 ich will zeigen wie wichtig ich f r die mannschaft bin mein n chster vertrag muss gut sein es ist meine letzte chance das rauszuholen was ich mir vorstelle
1913439 es wird ein kampfspiel in pfullendorf aber es ist auch ein richtiger h rtetest f r den start in der bundesliga
1913440 hundertprozentig stimmt die abstimmung noch nicht aber allein einer wie liberopoulos macht uns st rker er ist eiskalt vorm tor
1913441 die habe ich von ihr zum ersten jahrestag am 1 april geschenkt bekommen leider kann ich sie beim wettkampf nicht tragen weil sie st ren w rde
1913442 die schuhe sind nicht zum laufen gedacht und auch nicht daf r kinder irgendwelchen schaden zuzuf gen
1913443 achtung kann bei nutzung grinsen oder hysterisches lachen verursachen das ist normal
1913444 die gefahr dass der ami wieder zu drogen gegriffen h tte w re f r uns zu gro gewesen
1913445 wir brauchen spieler mit vorbildcharakter und den hat thomas nicht
1913446 mcgowan ist ein hei er kandidat er ist ein sehr athletischer sportler mit enormen spielerischen qualit ten er w rde deshalb gut zu uns passen
1913447 ich habe ihn in meinem ersten profijahr erlebt vor zwei jahren habe ich ihn dann zuletzt hier in k ln getroffen schon da ging es ihm schlecht
1913448 er war einer der ersten die hier h rter trainierten
1913449 er hat aber nie die menschliche seite der spieler vergessen oder vernachl ssigt sein tod trifft mich
1913450 ralph klein hat in basketball europa eine gro e l cke hinterlassen der deutsche basketball bund spricht der hinterbliebenen familie sein beileid aus und wird ihm ein ehrendes andenken bewahren
1913451 ich wei ich habe die leute beim deutschen olympischen sportbund gefragt seid ihr sicher dass ich das machen soll ich wollte niemandem auf den schlips treten keine gef hle verletzen verletzen ich habe auch gesagt ich verzichte darauf wenn es f r zu gro e missstimmung sorgt aber die meinten klar machst du das jetzt hoffe ich dass die leute sich f r mich und mit mir freuen
1913452 das ist eine riesensache f r mich bei olympia dabei zu sein ist f r mich ja schon ein traum das ist jetzt das i t pfelchen ich h tte nie gedacht dass ich fahnentr ger werde
1913453 am abend vor der offiziellen verk ndung haben es mir die dosb oberen gesagt ich durfte es aber niemandem erz hlen ich war schon ein bisschen nerv s habe aber trotzdem ganz gut geschlafen
1913454 na ja als ich am morgen vor der verk ndung nicht meine trainingssachen angezogen habe weil ich statt zum training zur pressekonferenz musste wussten die jungs nat rlich bescheid sie haben sich riesig f r mich gefreut meiner familie habe ich erst danach bescheid gesagt
1913455 bei dem gedanken l uft es mir kalt den r cken herunter ich war noch nie in einem so gro en stadion
1913456 ich bin ja recht kr ftig ich glaube schon dass ich das hinbekomme ich habe mich aber schon gefragt was ich da machen darf und was nicht mit der fahne rumwedeln darf ich auf jeden fall nicht
1913457 eine medaille w re nat rlich der hammer aber unsere gruppe ist sehr stark die gegner insgesamt st rker als in athen wichtig ist dass wir am sonntag mit einem sieg starten dann ist alles m glich
1913458 never again i will learn from my mistakes but im smack dab in the middle of it all over again and even now being acutely aware that im doing the same thing over again i dont walk away
1913459 chronologically the nearest ships of the same name were a dutch ship captured by one of raleighs ships in the late 1500s and another ship which carried emigrants from bristol to the new world between 1663 and 1679
1913460 it is important to note that this incident as well as the other two incidents that have occurred in recent days have resulted in injuries to individuals who work or volunteer caring for the animals and who assume the risk when they do so the injuries did not involve any harm to the general public
1913461 working with exotic animals especially large cats requires strict adherence to appropriate safety protocols when proper procedures are used big cats can be handled safely and without incident
1913462 there is another obstacle to overthrowing the status quo oppressively
1913463 to be stupid selfish and have good health are three requirements for happiness though if stupidity is lacking all is lost
1913464 would you prefer the happiness of scratching a mosquito bite over the happiness of not having a mosquito bite in the first place
1913465 how does one sum up in a few short minutes the many memories built upon more than 60 years of friendship
1913466 there is no possible way of doing justice to something of this magnitude
1913467 so i will simply remind us of the words of albert schweitzer that the important things in life are the signs of love and friendship that we leave behind when we go away
1913468 you could see such signs at the farewell fest here on cambrai fritsch kaserne on may 30 as the citizens and lord mayor of darmstadt graciously said thank you
1913469 you could see the signs as city officials prayed for the safety of our soldiers deploying to combat and welcomed them warmly when they returned
1913470 you could see the signs on that terrible day in september 2001 a day of indescribable sadness in darmstadts history as well as the local citizens laid flowers at our gates and embraced us while we mourned
1913471 the friendships they have inspired which make today a day of celebration and thanks thanks that we have been blessed to live with neighbors who have made this such a warm and caring community
1913472 to the city of darmstadt flown in freedom and friendship over cambrai fritsch kaserne
1913473 in the name of the magistrate and the citizens of darmstadt i sincerely thank you for this precious gift
1913474 we appreciate it as a symbol of all gifts of the usa and its people and of friendship
1913475 it also is a symbol of the pride of your nation of the most powerful democratic country that the world has ever seen we will cherish this flag
1913476 a deeply moving moment because in some sense it represents the end of the postwar period for darmstadt
1913477 soldiers of the u s army brought peace freedom and democracy to our city in the past 60 years we have enjoyed your protection by your presence you have ensured the independence of west germany preserved our freedom and given europe the longest period of peace ever
1913478 but you also have changed the germans beyond the political scope
1913479 you have deeply influenced and modernized our society and our culture through music through swing jazz rock and roll and pop through coke chewing gum petticoats woodstock jfk and
1913480 so i willingly repeat what i have said on the 30th of may at the german american freundschaftsfest we all have become americans a little bit at least and that is good indeed
1913481 we hope that the staff canteen of the german police in kabul afghanistan is as good as we have been told
1913482 when you sit there eating german roast please think of darmstadt a little bit
1913483 lt col david astin has commanded his garrison to the highest standards to the very end he continually motivates people with his positive outlook on life and can do it attitude through his personal involvement he has drawn down the operations of his command with as little impact to the tenant units and garrison workers as possible
1913484 he even learned how to tap a keg without getting all the vips and himself wet
1913485 i would again like to thank the city of darmstadt for the warm relations and the support they have given to the members of the u s forces stationed in their community
1913486 and while we will inactivate the garrison there will continue to be small enclaves of u s forces remaining in the immediate future that will continue to enjoy your hospitality
1913487 to the city of darmstadt flown in freedom and friendship over cambrai fritsch kaserne
1913488 lo que trato de expresar por medio de mi pintura nos comenta son los sentimientos que la mujer se entrega para s misma as como los que otorga por su incuestionable ternura y por su animismo pasional para que la persona al ver un cuadro m o se deje sentir as mismo en aquel instante en el que se detiene despert ndole emociones e inquietudes posibles eso es muy importante para m porque me agrada bastante porque siento que estoy logrando mover a la gente
1913489 lo malo de hoy en d a es que se le tiene que poner un precio alto de millones de d lares a la obra de arte para que sta sea considerada como una creaci n de muy buena calidad y eso efectivamente no tiene nada que ver con la calidad de la obra
1913490 lo que yo les recomendar a nos comenta a todos los pintores escultores y dem s artistas pl sticos es que no midan la perfecci n de sus obras a trav s del supuesto aval o que se les da y tambi n en aquellos instantes en los que su obra est expuesta en alguna galer a no se desmotiven en el momento de sentir que a la mayor a de la gente que ve su pintura no le agrade ya que todos tenemos un sinf n de puntos de vista por lo cual quienes se dedican a la cuesti n art stica tiene que seguir pintando sin importar el resultado
1913491 in my own travels overseas i have noticed a striking difference in the wording of prayers
1913492 your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples
1913493 no other regions in the country have recruited nearly that amount during a training cycle
1913494 today i was told by an afghan general that if kandahar becomes secure all of afghanistan will become secure
1913495 what were doing here in the provinces of kandahar and zabul helmand and oruzgan is designed to create a strong professional afghan national police force an impact here in regard to the security of afghanistan as well as the international community
1913496 were in the most volatile region in the country but were also producing the most trained afghan police than any other region
1913497 for example our efforts to train the afghan national police at the regional training center here in kandahar is limited to only 350 training seats a cycle
1913498 in order to train more than the 350 allowed this cycle we coordinated to send police to attend training at other afghan regional training centers
1913499 adding an additional 150 focused district development trained afghan national police to the community is well worth the extra effort
1913500 as the focused district development program is aging were creating a better training program with each iteration with police officers that graduate
1913501 were honing their skills and their understanding of what it means to be a police officer in this fight
1913502 some of the marksmanship practices of the past were point and shoot usually spray and pray kind of stuff
1913503 so were trying to teach them that controlled marksmanship here at the focused district development cycle training
1913504 theres people looking to stand up for their country to contribute to the security of their country and to do better for themselves and their lives
1913505 we are celebrating the grand opening of the ip station headquarters in lutifiyah its important for the people to open this police station because it connects baghdad and babil we need to have unity in this area
1913506 the local police give a lot of services in this area to support iraq and the people of iraq
1913507 this is one of our dreams to open this station tribal leaders and the 17th iraqi army division came together
1913508 this was the triangle of death now it is safe you can go anywhere
1913509 the tips from local citizens and sons of iraq groups in the desert areas around samarra have resulted in thousands of pounds of explosives taken from the enemy over past several months
1913510 finding this weapons cache obstructs the enemys ability to attack innocent civilians inside the population centers in the salah ad din province
1913511 the pentagon reservation is a unique place and the fact that were going to have a tourist attraction here has been a challenge for us
1913512 the pentagon reservation is not like the national mall in washington where its designed for visitors were just not designed that way
1913513 we are the major transportation hub in northern virginia we have the busiest metro stop the largest bus station
1913514 parking around the building is at a premium we have made accommodation for handicapped parking but there wont be any general public parking
1913515 because of what the memorial represents and the solemn nature of the memorial were going to try and maintain a very low key presence
1913516 we will have two security booths on either end of the fence and guards will be in the booths they will have an unobstructed view of the memorial we will have a roving patrol inside the memorial and there will be technological security devices
1913517 we will still reserve the right if we see some suspicious activity to take actions
1913518 we will see what happens as the process matures and we will adjust accordingly if we need to
1913519 what you do for the least of my brethren you do for me
1913520 do you know any were in a big rush we got a deadline
1913521 wait a second i understand why you think you need to speak to one of these people now but let me a have a few minutes to expand your perspective

1913526 to dream anything that you want to dream thats the beauty of the human mind to do anything that you want to do that is the strength of the human will to trust yourself to test your limits that is the courage to succeed
1913527 in the beginning the church was a fellowship of men and women centering on the living christ then the church moved to greece where it became a philosophy then it moved to rome where it became an institution next it moved to europe where it became a culture and finally it moved to america where it became an enterprise
1913528 dear boy what do we know of the idea of the divine and what can our narrow conceptions presume to tell of the supreme being if i called him by a hundred names like a turk i should yet fall short and have said nothing in comparison to the boundlessness of his attributes
1913529 the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities we need men who can dream of things that never were
1913530 focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition it asks too little of yourself because its only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential
1913531 i count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who overcomes his enemies
1913532 with the issue of graffiti were collaborating with the savannah chatham metro police to raise awareness that uncommissioned graffiti in the community is considered vandalism
1913533 this reminds me of something that took place a long time ago after the world war i the treaty of versailles blamed germany for causing the war now even though this seemed like the right thing to do it ended up causing poverty all over the country and made it hard for the country to redevelop
1913534 my attractiveness level falls somewhere between screech and zach morris

1913547 lets see we cannot take more than 4 ounces of shampoo on an airplane yet governor perdue wants us to carry guns at the airport yeah that makes a lot of sense
1913548 how can the property values increase way beyond what the property could sell for in this market have the assessors been asleep for the past year
1913549 instead of rolling back the millage to offset gains in the citys property tax digest what the city should do officials would keep the millage where it stands now 12 5 mills since property values have gone up those who were hit with larger assessments and arent protected by the stephens day homestead exemption will pay more
1913550 commercial property rentals and other non owner occupied property would see an increase or decrease solely based on the most recent assessment
1913551 but now that those rumors proved true their ethical misstep will be forgotten
1913552 concerning idolizing movie television and sports people this is one of the signs of a society collapsing do some research and youll find its true

1913577 the findings are narrow in focus and conclude that the lincoln group committed no legal violations because its actions in paying to place american information operations troops written articles without attribution were not expressly prohibited by its contract or military rules
1913578 in a modern information world connected by satellite television and the internet misleading information and lies could easily migrate into american news outlets
1913579 they were sending guys over there that had absolutely no knowledge of iraqis whatsoever it was a scheme written up on a cocktail napkin in d c they were just completely inept
1913580 the operation is designed to mask any connection with the u s military
1913581 helps translate and place the stories the lincoln groups iraqi staff or its subcontractors sometimes poses as freelance reporters or advertising executives when they deliver the stories to baghdad media outlets
1913582 in addition to paying newspapers to print government propaganda lincoln has paid about a dozen iraqi journalists each several hundred dollars a month a person who had been told of the transactions said
1913583 u s special operations command awarded three five year contracts in june 2005 for contractors to develop slogans advertisements newspaper articles radio spots and television programs to build support for u s policies overseas
1913584 paying iraqi newspapers to run pro american articles ghostwritten under a separate military contract
1913585 given wide latitude and urged to be creative in the approaches we take
1913586 to mount an aggressive advertising and public relations campaign that will accurately inform the iraqi people of the coalitions goals and gain their support
1913587 we believe that it is necessary to counter the misinformation that is put out by our adversaries trying to get out accurate information is an important part of what the u s needs to do to show our side of the story
1913588 we counter the lies intimidation and pure evil of terror with factual stories that highlight the heroism and sacrifice of the iraqi people and their struggle for freedom and security
1913589 we are encouraged by their sacrifice and proud to help them tell their side of the story

1913659 by trading for brett favre the gang green surely made a statement that they are a win now team they are a team that only needs a real qb to make a run at the super bowl neither weak armed qb chad pennington or interception prone qb kellen clems stepped up during training camp thus far which obviously prompted the jets management to make this desperate step
1913660 favres a sure fire upgrade favre marries what we all loved best in pennington his poise and experience with clemens biggest promise an unparalelled arm coles complained about not geting deep routes now well have a chance to see whether hes as good as he thinks he is theres no question in my mind that as an athlete that favre is a better player than what the jets had on the roster and i think i some regards allows the team the offense they had in mind for this year this looks deperate to outsiders though but i read it as a pretty savvy move it gives clemens or ainge time to develop and allows them to really compete this year the sense of deperation is more about filling a new stadium than for their jobs i know that favre makes them better but it also sells more seats jerseys etc

1913663 oh my goodness please eric mangini dump that announce the whole team at once thing for opening day at the meadowlands
1913664 one would assume that favre only makes the jets offense more productive hes got a stronger arm than anyone on nys roster takes risks which sometimes translate into big rewards and sometimes not and hes a veteran leader that guys like jones laveranues coles and a slew of young but talented offensive linemen can look up to the jets have been hamstrung by limited quarterback play for years favre is anything but limited but is his head in it and is he ready to play one of the reasons favre was so productive last year was because he worked his ass off in the offseason to get into the best shape of his life with all the hoopla that has occurred over the past few weeks months has he stayed in relatively good football shape the guy is a grizzled veteran so one would assume hes taken care of his body but only time will tell if the 38 year old signal caller is ready to take the jets back to the playoffs in 08

1913844 if i had to pick something it would be directing to a domain i own sethgodin com instead of sethgodin typepad com

1913862 deepgulfs j flex system will enable the development of vast regions in the deepest parts of the gulf of mexico for oil and gas as well as ultra deep fields in other parts of the world
1913863 deep gulfs ability to lay very large pipelines in ultra deep water can reignite interest in the untapped ultra deep leased blocks in the deepest part of the gulf
1913864 the efficiencies of the jflex system not only enable deepgulf to lay faster thus completing the system sooner saving on construction cost it also means that our customer can get a field into production sooner speeding the payback of their investment
1913865 the non articulating tower and flexed pipe system is a simplification over existing j lay systems that reduces vulnerability to the elements and increases productivity this is just one part of a revolutionary design capable of laying big pipe 36 inch in ultra deep waters 12 000 foot big deep and fast will create new economic models in the ultra deep offshore oil and gas industry
1913866 we chose lott ship because of their undisputed excellence in this particular segment of the industry and also for their proprietary osilas software system
1913867 mainstream erp systems are very large enterprise level resource management systems that do not meet all the rigorous demands at the operational level of the offshore construction industry these heavy sometimes cumbersome systems can actually make problems worse in an industry where not having the right part at the right moment can create shutdowns that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per day and the cost of delivering a one dollar part frequently reaches thousands of dollars
1913868 we are delighted with and excited about the opportunity to partner with deepgulf and their revolutionary new pipelay system
1913869 we expect to benefit from partnering with the only company that has the technology capable of constructing pipelines in the deepest parts of the gulf of mexico
1913870 big deep and fast that is how we think about our j flex system
1913871 says rus howard chairman deepgulf referring to the j flex ability to lay 36 pipe in 12 000 feet of water
1913872 deepgulfs ability to lay very large pipelines in ultra deep water will reignite interest in the untapped ultra deep leased blocks in the deepest part of the gulf not only will the j flex system lay much bigger pipe in deeper water than our competitors it will also lay it faster completing projects with more economic efficiency j flex innovations will spur many emerging efficiencies in the construction of ultra deep offshore oil and gas pipelines deep gulf will be at the center of that development
1913873 deepgulf is already fielding inquiries from major oil companies and ultra deep field contractors in the gulf of mexico and other locations around the world it is clear that ultra deep is where the action is in offshore construction and deepgulfs j flex technology will play an important role in the worlds energy supply
1913874 big deep and fast that is how we think about our j flex system
1913875 says rus howard chairman deepgulf referring to the j flex ability to lay 36 pipe in 12 000 feet of water

1913947 we examined the impact that a waiver would have on ethanol use corn prices and fuel prices as well as the current price for renewable fuel credits which are used to demonstrate compliance with the rfs mandate this research found that the rfs mandate is not causing severe economic harm rather the rfs is strengthening our nations economic security and supporting americas farming communities
1913948 denying texas request is a mistake that will only increase the already heavy financial burden on families while doing even more harm to the livestock industry good intentions and laudable goals are small compensation to the families farmers and ranchers who are being hurt by the federal governments efforts to trade food for fuel any government mandate that artificially props up a single industry to the detriment of millions of americans is bad public policy
1913949 epas decision is a benefit to the u s economy because increasing domestic ethanol production is keeping gasoline and oil prices lower than they otherwise would be thereby saving the average american household as much as 500 a year in lower transportation costs most economists now recognize the real severe economic harm is being done by the skyrocketing price of oil and not by ethanol production in fact without ethanol production the damage from high oil prices would be even worse

1913970 the basic idea that we have as a band is to take the listener on an emotional roller coaster not just write about girlfriend problems but to have this seamless album from start to finish and really have it communicate to them
1913971 arizona courts have clearly ruled that prison officials cannot stand in the way of the medical needs of women prisoners
1913972 its regrettable that we need to take extra steps to ensure that sheriff arpaio follows the law
1913973 the courts have already confirmed our position that arizona prison officials cannot ignore the medical needs of prisoners simply because they do not agree with the decision to end a pregnancy
1913974 now given the disregard of the court ruling by sheriff arpaio and his staff it appears that we need to spell out the law more clearly to protect future women detainees

1913987 i would have been definitely proud to represent this country but now im in the majors and im hoping to stay here as long as possible
1913988 i know its going to get a lot worse in september

1914019 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1914020 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1914021 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
1914022 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

1914031 i woke up about a year ago and realized at 79 my mother wasnt going to be around forever so now every monday when i get off work i drive to her house and we spend the evening together before i drive the 40 minutes home we have dinner together watch tv knit i take out her garbage or help her find a misplaced item or whatever she needs i listen to her tell me the same things she told me last week and the week before or 15 minutes ago over and over but i realize how precious our time together is and i enjoy that she is chatty so i try to never discourage her talking by letting on that she is repeating herself as a couple of my sisters tend to tell her i hope someone will be as patient and caring with me when im her age

1914068 human consciousness is a function of the ebb and flow of neural impulses in various regions of the brain the very substrate that drugs such as psilocybin act upon
1914069 understanding what mediates these effects is clearly within the realm of neuroscience and deserves investigation
1914070 a vast gap exists between what we know of these drugs mostly from descriptive anthropology and what we believe we can understand using modern clinical pharmacology techniques
1914071 that gap is large because as a reaction to the excesses of the 1960s human research with hallucinogens has been basically frozen in time these last forty years
1914072 even in this study where we greatly controlled conditions to minimize adverse effects about a third of subjects reported significant fear with some also reporting transient feelings of paranoia
1914073 under unmonitored conditions its not hard to imagine those emotions escalating to panic and dangerous behavior
1914074 is that under very defined conditions with careful preparation you can safely and fairly reliably occasion whats called a primary mystical experience that may lead to positive changes in a person its an early step in what we hope will be a large body of scientific work that will ultimately help people

1914206 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody should have told him im a fuckin rock star
1914207 today is gonna be the day that im gonna throw it back at you
1914208 but thank god for my friends and family for knowing that i can do this without hime
1914209 my higher power for so long he has had all the control over me and hasnt treated me right for the last year or so
1914210 instead speaking the truth in love we will in all things grow up into him who is the head that is christ
1914211 back in the days when i was young im not a kid anymore but some days i sit and wish i was a kid again
1914212 hey do you think this looks nice or should i get it in a small yeah what no i cant hear you speak up
1914213 i guess the supreme court will have to rethink its decision on this because it can effectively kill the peace process
1914214 if we would do this all over again what government must do is to bring everyone in the loop meaning to say the supreme court and congress because the philippine government commits the whole state and not just the executive
1914215 i guess the supreme court made a decision based on the submissions and did not have the benefit of full briefing on the security political economic implications if this moa ad is not signed
1914216 if the talks break down because of this tro there are a lot of political ramifications and i think the sc was not fully informed about this
1914217 sub state for the bangsamoro in a defined territory in southern philippines
1914218 the moa ad is basically a road map it contains the intentions of the parties to have doable peace in mindanao and the subsequent legal and constitutional processes are still to be undertaken by the philippine government
1914219 theres really no irreparable damage or injury that needs to be prevented as to justify the issuance of the tro by the supreme court
1914220 the most important thing to remember is that what the moa ad commits with respect to the areas wherein zamboanga north cotabato people are protesting is basically an inclusion on the list but they will be asked sometime in the future within a year whether or not they would like to be part of the armm
1914221 will have serious ramifications in the security and stability in southern philippines
1914222 basically the ball is in the governments hands and this is internal to the grp
1914223 because as far as the milf is concerned this is a done deal already and what was scheduled today was a merely a formal ceremony to celebrate the signing of the moa ad
1914224 to seek constitutional change and reform e g shift to federalism has not been usually treated as unconstitutional except it seems when it has to do with the moro question
1914225 in fact it is even normal for peace processes as shown by the experience of many countries to seek and effect constitutional change and reform as needed for a negotiated political settlement
1914226 would entail changes in the existing legal including constitutional framework
1914227 it is to the credit of the grp side that it is now willing to effect constitutional change as needed as part of an overall solution to the bangsamoro problem
1914228 frame a qualitatively better and higher degree of self determination for the bangsamoro people short of independence or secession
1914229 these are peace negotiations not surrender negotiations between two sides which simply have different frameworks if not world views
1914230 as for the milf and for that matter the ndf have often said what point is there to these negotiations if their side will just accept the framework of the philippine constitution
1914231 let us face it this constitution has outlived its usefulness with regards to the bangsamoro peoples problem and the conflict in mindanao
1914232 yeah ive had a good idea this will make things clearer
1914233 were taking the action to reduce costs and improve overall competitiveness of our business particularly our semiconductor business
1914234 and to reflect the pay practices of other companies in the information technology industry
1914235 people are not happy this affects employees in manufacturing who only make 30 000 a year
1914236 it is unacceptable to the alliance ibm cwa local 1701 that ibm slashes the pay of employees while ibm posts record profits and gives the executives double digit pay raises
1914237 ibm just had new york state money given to them to keep and retain jobs yet cuts the pay of ibmers who are new york state taxpayers
1914238 the investments in new york support our business there over the long term
1914239 the two are separate and arent really linked at all
1914240 the investments in new york are to support over the long term and ensure ibm is competitive
1914241 out of the same mouth we bless people and we curse people and that should not be so
1914242 writers in mainstream america like jonathan kellerman are lumping the indigo school shooters with the psychopaths the dark entities who are bullies con men stalkers victimizers serial killers and those who kill for thrills i dont believe these indigo children who have taken weapons to school to harm other children are psychopaths they have been bullied and teased and have an avenger attitude seeking justice for injuries inflicted on them they arent killing just for the thrill of killing these kids know changes have to be made within the school system and they chose violence to make their statement to give us a wake up call some of these metaphysical indigo children are not hesitant about using violence to bring about change and to bring us to enlightenment generation of iindigo violence is here and it will continue at least with this present ndigo children we are seeing with the current indigo violence how the school system needs to be changed and how imperative it is to address the issues of bullying and intimidation in school as the indigo children grow to adulthood their agendas will move out of the school system into our other systems our social political and judicial systems for example timothy mcveigh the oklahoma city bomber is an indigo
1914243 some of these metaphysical indigo children are not hesitant about using violence to bring about change and to bring us to enlightenment

1914323 outra caiu entre os espinhos e os espinhos cresceram com ela e sufocaram a planta 4 mas outra semente caiu em terra boa e brotou cresceu e produziu fruto trinta vezes sessenta vezes e cem vezes mais o que havia sido semeado
1914324 a semente a palavra de deus os que est o beira do caminho s o os que ouvem mas depois vem o diabo e tira a palavra do seu cora o para que n o acreditem nem sejam salvos
1914325 se o nosso evangelho est encoberto est encoberto para os que est o perdidos nos quais o deus deste mundo o diabo cegou os entendimentos dos que n o cr em para que a luz do glorioso evangelho de cristo n o resplande a sobre eles
1914326 algumas pessoas como as sementes semeadas em ch o pedregoso ouvem a palavra e a princ pio a recebem com alegria mas n o t m raiz e acreditam por um certo tempo mas quando chega a ang stia e a persegui o por causa da palavra logo ficam ofendidas e rapidamente se desviam
1914327 estou com voc s sempre nunca os deixarei nem os desampararei
1914328 outros como a semente semeada entre espinhos ouvem a palavra mas os cuidados e preocupa es desta vida a sedu o das riquezas e o desejo por outras coisas entram e sufocam a palavra tornando os infrut feros
1914329 os que recebem a semente que caiu em terra boa s o os que com um cora o honesto e bom ouvem a palavra e a ret m e com paci ncia produzem fruto trinta sessenta ou cem vezes mais o que foi semeado

1914354 one life to live continues to be a mainstay of abc programming we are proud to bring this show to the community of abc 7 it is not just a show but has helped to bring strong social issues to the forefront
1914355 this show first aired in 1968 that would make the show 40 years old next year it is a long standing daytime show and for good reason women and particularly moms continue to be the demographic of this genre of television
1914356 this gift is to help cumberlands grow and stand and do all the things it has always done

1914359 having been a military lawyer for over 25 years i know how hard military jurors try to render fair and impartial justice i respect the military commissions work product in terms of a guilty finding and the sentence handed down by the military jurors i hope all americans will as well
1914360 both the verdict and sentence can be reviewed by our federal judiciary
1914361 it is important to remember hamdan was bin ladens driver and did provide material support to the architect of 9 11 it is clear from the evidence he is an enemy combatant
1914362 the decision to release an enemy combatant who could return to the battlefield is a decision separate and apart from whether an individual in question committed a war crime any decision to release hamdan by the executive or judicial branch of our government needs to appreciate that this man chose to make a living by being the personal driver and assistant to the most dangerous terrorist in the world during a time of war we do not want to send a message this is an acceptable line of work
1914363 saying that an individual should not be invited to the union and acting upon this is not equivalent to denying them their right to free speech
1914364 griffin and irving are not exceptional because they advocate free speech in general but because they advocate free speech of a particular type that which promotes the views outlined above but we have agreed that those views are unacceptable to us if you disagree then obviously this discussion is wasted therefore their contribution is irrelevant to the debate
1914365 the dignity of fellow students citizens and residents of oxford is violated by the invitation of people who have called for them to be expelled from this country
1914366 let me end by saying that as a black person i think it is important that we do not inadvertently let racist bigots end up being the winners if we paint ourselves as hapless victims whose collective experiences of institutionalised and other forms of racism make us so emotionally and intellectually weak that we cannot engage them publicly then we are perpetuating a crippling sense of victimhood rather than transcending it
1914367 even agreeing that withdrawing the invitations is not equivalent to an attack on free speech this is not in itself a reason for them to be withdrawn
1914368 that means that those who protest against how they exercise that right is overstepping the bounds of common courtesy at the very least and quite possibly overstepping the ethical bounds that are created by institutional rights
1914369 people are incapable of reflecting on and speaking to elements of their life that was incidental
1914370 if a group that despised homosexuals and believed they were going to burn in hell wanted to discuss whether to tolerate homosexuality or engage in homophobic acts would it help to get a homosexual individual to go and talk to them those members who hate him will not be moved either way by his appeals for tolerance those who do not may be now back to the union what i said was that if we share moral sentiments on racism anti semitism and genocide denial then these men cannot inform our discussion about where if to limit free speech of course if people do not share those sentiments than they may certainly by influenced by griffin and irvings appeals
1914371 you make it seem as if everyone has a deep moral intuition that the content of a racists or homophobes views should not be engaged
1914372 people demand freedom of speech to make up for the freedom of thought which they avoid

1914382 that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in
1914383 i never thought id say this but paris hiltons plan is sound
1914384 ive maintained all along that we need the best ideas of the political left the best of the right and the best of the center we need bipartisan ideas welded together if paris hilton gets into the act with her plan im all for it
1914385 so now well just have to see what britney has to say and maybe combine them both into a policy
1914386 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americans energy crisis
1914387 exquisitely and sensitively filmed this documentary goes to the heart of its subject it captures the passion calm poetry and venom of an incredible human being the film weaves us through historically charged footage right through to the present and allows us glimpses at an uncompromising and consistent energy that has always believed in the empowerment of all

1914402 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience

1914467 no action taken by law enforcement agencies or their agents should change data held on a computer or storage media which may be relied upon in court
1914468 i think the most notable for me was the baigent boys there was no doubt charlotte baigent had made a concerted effort to disrupt fibres fingerprints and dna from the vehicle that they had transported andrew scanlan in
1914469 finding all the csi tapes at their home helped prove they had tried to clean up
1914470 i think people are becoming more forensically aware but that has always been the way we always have to try to keep one step ahead of them
1914471 i think programmes such as csi give people a bit more of an idea and there are a lot of cop shows on telly but they also pick up ideas in other ways a lot go through the system on a regular basis so become more aware of techniques we use
1914472 we do see evidence being thrown away on a regular basis trying to disrupt opportunities for us to gather evidence but however hard they try the forensic science service does a fantastic job even in that case with all the attempts made by the defendants to get rid of fibres and dna they still found evidence
1914473 i didnt realise at first just how much into csi they were
1914474 it was only when police told me that witnesses had said people were cleaning the car quite vigorously a short time after andrew scanlan disappeared and rolling tape on their hands to try to remove any forensic trace that would show mr scanlan had been in the vehicle
1914475 luckily for us there always tends to be some fibres left behind
1914476 but there was other evidence in that case forensics that they couldnt do anything about
1914477 but i think were always going to have more tools available to us to detect
1914478 my client is going through a difficult time as you can imagine he is distraught
1914479 we will work diligently to provide the best defense for our client against these charges
1914480 the victim was not interested in marrying nor remaining married to her husband
1914481 this was causing a great deal of friction between the victim and her father
1914482 apparently she and the father had argued over the marriage and the fact that it was arranged and at some point during the altercation he did end up killing his daughter
1914483 my immediate reaction was that this is an anomaly in the south asian community
1914484 this isnt a rampant problem within south asian communities what is a problem i think is domestic violence and that cuts across all communities
1914485 unfortunately the hysterics surrounding john mark karr served only to distract boulder officials from doing their job which should be solving the murder of jonbenet ramsey
1914486 information that will lead to the arrest and conviction of her killer
1914487 patsy ramsey issues challenge if you think i did it lets have a trial and get it over with
1914488 she said that after four years of being under police suspicion she and her husband john are weary frustrated and desperate for some normalcy in their lives
1914489 the ramseys said being the focus of a murder mystery that still gets worldwide attention has drained their finances and let them and their son burke 13 into a cocoonlike existence without tv or newspapers in their home
1914490 it was clear from the authorities questions that patsy ramsey is the main suspect
1914491 obviously were disappointed that the ramseys have declined to take the polygraph exams after very publicly saying they would
1914492 however our offer still stands should the ramseys decide to change their position
1914493 there is very good reason based on the evidence for the ramseys to be under the umbrella of suspicion
1914494 why wasnt the media all over gov owens even if we are guilty he shouldnt be the justice department
1914495 the governor finds it hard to believe anyone would even care what the ramseys would have to say anymore
1914496 the detectives who know this case better than anyone were advised by the district attorneys office that we would not be participating as grand jury advisory witnesses
1914497 her panicked mother patsy ramsey and that her father john ramsey opted to protect his wife in the investigation that followed
1914498 in my hypothesis an approaching fortieth birthday the busy holiday season an exhausting christmas day a couple of glasses of wine and an argument with jonbenet had left patsy frazzled
1914499 when they came home john ramsey helped burke put together a christmas toy
1914500 later jonbenet awakened after wetting her bed as indicated by the plastic sheets the urine stains the pull up diaper package hanging halfway out of a cabinet and the balled up turtleneck found in the bathroom
1914501 as i told lou smit an investigator hired by the d
1914502 patsy would not be the first mother to lose control in such a situation
1914503 it was the critical moment in which she had to either call for help or find an alternative explanation for her daughters death
1914504 john and burke continued to sleep while patsy moved the body of jonbenet down to the basement and hid her in the little room
1914505 as i pictured the scene her dilemma was that police would assume the obvious if a 6 year old child was found dead in a private home without any satisfactory explanation patsy needed a diversion and planned the way she thought a kidnapping should look
1914506 flipped to the middle of the tablet and started a ransom note drafting one that ended on page 25 for some reason she discarded that one and ripped pages 17 25 from the tablet police never found those pages on page 26 she began the mr amp mrs i then also abandoned that false start at some point she drafted the long ransom note by doing so she created the governments best piece of evidence
1914507 then faced the major problem of what to do with the body
1914508 the distant almost inaccessible basement room was the best option
1914509 as i envisioned it patsy returned to the basement a woman caught up in panic where she could have seen perhaps by detecting a faint heartbeat or a sound or a slight movement that although completely unconscious jonbenet was not dead
1914510 in my scenario she choked jonbenet from behind with a grip on the broken paintbrush handle pulling the ligature jonbenet still unconscious would never have felt it
1914511 then the staging continued to make it look more like a kidnapping
1914512 there was bloody mucus under the tape and a perfect set of the childs lip prints which did not indicate a tongue impression or resistance
1914513 this woman to whom looking good appeared always so important that she had a closet full of designer clothes had attended a party come home late put her children to bed gone to sleep herself arose early to fly across the country put on fresh makeup and fixed her hair and then put on the same clothes she had worn the previous night not likely in my opinion
1914514 if we catch you talking to a stray dog she dies
1914515 listen carefully we are a group of individuals that represent a small foreign faction we
1914516 any deviation of my instructions will result in the immediate execution of your daughter
1914517 check for any sign of jonbenet or anything that might have been left or taken that belonged to jonbenet
1914518 john ramsey immediately went to the basement of the house followed by fleet white and john fernie within a few minutes fleet came running upstairs grabbed the telephone in the back office located on the first floor and yelled for someone to call for an ambulance
1914519 detective arndt ran to the front of the house where the door leading to the basement was located
1914520 boulder police refused to release jonbenets body for burial unless the ramseys agreed to come to the police station and submit to a hostile interrogation
1914521 q there has been some question as to why you hired a defense attorney
1914522 a mr ramsey well we were fortunate from almost the moment that we found the note to be surrounded by friends our minister our family doctor a personal friend of mine who is also an attorney and we relied on their guidance almost from that moment on and my friend suggested that it would be foolish not to have knowledgeable counsel to help both us and with the investigation
1914523 a mr ramsey look for clues asking us to do that give us something more to do to occupy our mind and so we started in the basement and and we were just looking and we one room in the basement that when i opened the door there were no windows in that room and i turned the light on and i that was her
1914524 when i opened the door there were no windows in that room and i turned the light on and i that was her
1914525 our experts tell us that given the emotional state of the parents at this stage polygraph tests would produce absolutely nothing useful or worthwhile
1914526 was particularly interested in santa bill mcreynolds and his wife janet mcreynolds and when the professor reported they didnt write that ransom note hunter seemed to lose interest
1914527 i believe i am going to conclude the ransom note was the work of a single individual patsy ramsey
1914528 much more than one letter looking like another even the slightest things such as the use of periods or the space before the start of a paragraph could create a distinctive linguistic fingerprint
1914529 sentence structure word usage and identifying features can be a signature
1914530 in my opinion it is not possible that any individual except patsy ramsey wrote the ransom note
1914531 he explained that language is infinitely diverse and that no two people use it in quite the same way
1914532 foster dissected the ransom note explained that the wording contained intelligent and sometimes clever usage of language and said the text suggested someone who was trying to deceive
1914533 the documents he studied from patsy ramsey in his opinion formed a precise and unequivocal match with the ransom note he read a list of unique matches with the note that included such things as her penchant for inventing private acronyms spelling habits indentation alliterative phrasing metaphors grammar vocabulary frequent use of exclamation points and even the format of her handwriting on the page
1914534 not only did certain letters change but her entire writing style seemed to have been transformed after the homicide there were new ways of indenting spelling and writing out long numbers that contrasted with her earlier examples and she was the only suspect who altered her usual preferences when supplying writing samples to the police
1914535 i criss crossed the country conducting interviews and investigation pursuing pedophiles and drifters chasing and discarding leads
1914536 theres blood and contusions in the vagina and the hymen has been torn
1914537 this vicious leak is one more example of the pattern of official misconduct which has characterized this investigation for the past 19 months police sources leak what they claim is critical evidence and spin it against the ramseys the ramseys are helpless to reply because they do not have access to the evidence
1914538 did not fit an act of sex or revenge or one in which money was the motivation taken alone they said each piece of evidence might be argued but together enough pebbles become a block of evidentiary granite
1914539 casku observed that they had never seen anything like the ramsey ransom note kidnapping demands are usually terse such as we have your kid a million dollars will call you from a kidnappers point of view the fewer words the less police have to go on
1914540 believed that the note was written in the house after the murder and indicated panic ransom notes are normally written prior to the crime usually proofread and not written by hand in order to disguise the authorship
1914541 indicated staging rather than control and the garrote was used from behind so the killer could avoid eye contact typical of someone who cares for the victim
1914542 was committed by someone who had a high degree of comfort inside the home
1914543 we in america have a legal system that is designed to be adversarial it is apparent to me that the only adversary relationships within the legal system of the 20th judicial district are the relationships between law enforcement agencies and the office of the district attorney the ignoring of compelling physical evidence the artificial bolstering of conviction statistics through plea bargaining deferred prosecutions and deferred sentences speaks loudly of incompetence and political maneuvering the essence of my belief is that the citizens of boulder county do not have an advocate in the judicial system
1914544 sexual assault in boulder county the crimes and their consequences
1914545 its something theyre pushing and i think its a good thing
1914546 in addition to crime mapping and alerts to communities the system includes a basic analytic element that provides a snapshot of crime at the neighborhood level

1914576 oh yeah they talked about this in our crytology class you can make sure that youre document code is safe because if the electronics act the same it means that the code is broken and the document isnt secure
1914577 correct well like i was saying theyve learned to transmit light this way but ive figured out how to do more with it

1914775 tidak baik seperti yang kaulakukan itu 18 18 engkau akan menjadi sangat lelah baik engkau baik bangsa yang beserta engkau ini sebab pekerjaan ini terlalu berat bagimu takkan sanggup engkau melakukannya seorang diri saja 18 19 jadi sekarang dengarkanlah perkataanku aku akan memberi nasihat kepadamu dan allah akan menyertai engkau adapun engkau wakililah bangsa itu di hadapan allah dan kauhadapkanlah perkara perkara mereka kepada allah 18 20 kemudian haruslah engkau mengajarkan kepada mereka ketetapan ketetapan dan keputusan keputusan dan memberitahukan kepada mereka jalan yang harus dijalani dan pekerjaan yang harus dilakukan 18 21 di samping itu kaucarilah dari seluruh bangsa itu orang orang yang cakap dan takut akan allah orang orang yang dapat dipercaya dan yang benci kepada pengejaran suap tempatkanlah mereka di antara bangsa itu menjadi pemimpin seribu orang pemimpin seratus orang pemimpin lima puluh orang dan pemimpin sepuluh orang 18 22 dan sewaktu waktu mereka harus mengadili di antara bangsa maka segala perkara yang besar haruslah dihadapkan mereka kepadamu tetapi segala perkara yang kecil diadili mereka sendiri dengan demikian mereka meringankan pekerjaanmu dan mereka bersama sama dengan engkau turut menanggungnya 18 23 jika engkau berbuat demikian dan allah memerintahkan hal itu kepadamu maka engkau akan sanggup menahannya dan seluruh bangsa ini akan pulang dengan puas senang ke tempatnya

1914853 after the massive delays sql server 2005 had microsoft and especially ted kummert corporate vice president of microsofts data and storage platform division were pretty vocal that it wouldnt happen again kummert had said that future releases would ship on a 24 to 36 month cycle and end of summer is basically the outside limit of that window im pretty sure he didnt want to be made a liar in the first major release on his watch
1914854 interesting features for developers and administrators and some things that could help sql server continue its march up market

1914857 football does not finish for me because i will leave barcelona
1914858 i have reached a certain stage in my career where i realise they will not have me in the world of football it is necessary to be intelligent and to see that many players dont get a chance
1914859 i have not had the opportunities to demonstrate if i have the qualities to be at barcelona or not
1914860 were happy with our core of players but we need to make it stronger and we have to provide more competition for places in case we pick up a couple of injuries as is going to happen throughout the season
1914861 up at this level you cant bring in loan players during the season once the window shuts thats you so we need to make sure were covered in every department
1914862 we all know he has the ability brian always had ability but he has wasted some years of his career at a level that he shouldnt be playing at and that is no disrespect to linlithgow rose
1914863 weve given him an opportunity and i hope he takes it hes not a bad lad and he has matured as a person hopefully he can play a part in creating something special for hamilton accies in the premier league
1914864 football does not finish for me because i will leave barcelona
1914865 i have reached a certain stage in my career where i realise they will not have me in the world of football it is necessary to be intelligent and to see that many players dont get a chance
1914866 i have not had the opportunities to demonstrate if i have the qualities to be at barcelona or not
1914867 but the chances of them coming in before the celtic game this sunday are slim to say the least
1914868 but you never say never well keep looking to see whats out there and hopefully we can do something
1914869 the transfer window doesnt close until the end of the month so we do have some time on our hands
1914870 i think we know now my having been here for three years that we have to win every game if anyone gets a shot on our goal there has to be an enquiry
1914871 fitness is good and i want it to keep it that way
1914872 that is why a lot of the players who have played a lot arent playing against manchester city these guys are ready for the game on sunday
1914873 we took on the fixture just after we had won the league and as the euphoria had set in and i would have agreed to any suggestion chief executive peter lawwell had chucked at me
1914874 hibs havent won any of their pre season games and we want that bad run to continue
1914875 we want to punish them and get off to a good start
1914876 however we know you cant take too much notice of pre season friendly results its a different attitude for competitive games than friendlies
1914877 itll be good to see colin nish again and listen to all his moaning when im kicking him
1914878 its good to get back into the competitive side of games but as were starting off the season at home its important we win
1914879 weve played some nice football in our pre season games
1914880 conor has a good presence about him hes fast and im sure once he scores his first goal hell get confidence from it
1914881 we have had hamilton watched five times in pre season
1914882 its fair to say we are well aware of what they can do
1914883 also we played against them in the cup last year and they have not changed their side much over the summer
1914884 that consistency of personnel will be a big strength for hamilton as their lads all know each other inside out
1914885 on top of that they have a winning mentality having secured plenty of victories on their way to clinching the first division championship last season
1914886 playing in the spl will be a step up there is no question about that but hamilton have a lot of good young players and this is an opportunity they will relish
1914887 they wont be scared that is for sure and the younger ones have a lot of potential to improve
1914888 i know the people at hamilton and they are good football folk
1914889 there is no doubt they will have the team fit determined and well organised so it is a really tough start for us
1914890 when we played them in the cup last season we had to play really well to beat them and i expect that to be no different on monday
1914891 the atmosphere tends to be artificial i did not find it a productive place
1914892 youre always going to be worried that in that first meeting theyre going to be like ok its kate hudson and matthew mcconaughey on a desert island hunting for pirate treasure but its not going to go that way

1914898 when young david went up against goliath he was only a small shepherd boy king saul offered david his armor to protect him from the big philistine but david knew the weight of the armor would be a hindrance to him instead david used the skills he had developed as a shepherd to protect his sheep a slingshot and stones were his weapons when the time came for david to exercise his faith in god to slay the giant he used the talents god had trained him to use the shepherd fields were davids training grounds there he learned to fight lions and protect his sheep now he would protect gods sheep god gives us the same talents to achieve the things he wants us to achieve however not all of us will be heroes some of us have been called to use our talents to serve others to benefit the kingdom of god davids faith was the reason god gave him victory david declared that he came in the name of the living god and that the whole world would know the god of israel because of the defeat of goliath by a small shepherd boy this is why god gave him victory over goliath so the world might know the living god

1914919 a guy had driven his truck into the waste lagoon and drowned not only was it full of urine and liquid pig feces the farmer had dumped all the needles used to inject the pigs with antibiotics and hormones in there

1914930 as an attorney i respect the legal process but the mayors legal issues have become more than a distraction
1914931 this should be the straw that breaks the camels back come on what do you need
1914932 not to speak out at this point after what happened today would be pure cowardice
1914933 so instead of talking about all the good things were doing the conversation is all about the mayor
1914934 that doesnt help me when i go out and try to market the region
1914935 i couldnt read what it said but what was on the front page a picture of kwame
1914936 i understand that this is a difficult political decision but it is my opinion that the time for political considerations is over why is she waiting for a hearing what is she going to hear that judge and the entire world hasnt heard already
1914937 at a time when the eyes of the world are on our state for the pga championship and we should be showing off everything that is great about our michigan the focus instead will be on the mayor who continues to sully our reputation and harm the efforts of hard working individuals trying to lift michigan
1914938 the mayor pushed the limits and pushed the limits and pushed the limits
1914939 i think the judge tried to be flexible but after a while he ran out of options
1914940 were gonna have to find someone else to be the face of detroit to stand up and do the day to day we just dont have any more options
1914941 all of these other things are sucking the life out our image our progress

1914956 it does not violate federal law or department policy to search for and consider political information concerning candidates for political positions however goodling also conducted such searches and considered the results of those searches for candidates for career positions including ijs and career candidates for temporary details

1914999 mail mx having two interfaces allows us to set the postfix mx concurrency to something sensibly low to prevent a spam influx from overloading our server while at the same time we can retain a high concurrency on the customer smtp settings so that our users dont ever see a connection refused error lets assume our network interface is eth0 then there is a file etc sysconfig network scripts ifcfg eth0 which looks like this device eth0 bootproto static broadcast 192 168 1 255 ipaddr 192 168 1 10 netmask 255 255 255 0 network 192 168 1 0 onboot yes type ethernet now we want to create the virtual interface eth0 0 with the ip address 192 168 0 101 all we have to do is to create the file etc sysconfig network scripts ifcfg eth0 0 which looks like this device eth0 0 bootproto static broadcast 192 168 1 255 ipaddr 192 168 1 11 netmask 255 255 255 0 network 192 168 1 0 onboot yes type ethernet once that has been done you have to restart the network for the changes to take effect if you then run ifconfig you should see something like this eth0 link encap ethernet hwaddr 00 07 e9 4b ad 83 inet addr 192 168 1 10 bcast 192 168 1 255 mask 255 255 255 0 up broadcast running multicast

1915019 dalam pembuatan larutan buah durian memerlukan biaya yang sangat sedikit jika dibandingkan dengan harga obat nyamuk elektrik buatan pabrik maka obat nyamuk ini lebih efektif efisien dan ramah lingkungan
1915020 obat nyamuk elektrik yang dianggap paling aman masih disinyalir dapat membahayakan kesehatan sehingga dibutuhkan obat nyamuk elektrik yang aman nyaman dan ramah lingkungan
1915021 kami mengasumsikan bahwa buah durian dapat mengusir nyamuk melalui bau yang sangat tajam dan menyengat dan bau tersebut tidak disukai nyamuk
1915022 kami melakukan pengujian terhadap penggunaan larutan buah durian sebagai obat nyamuk elektrik diperlukan ruangan 1 1 meter persegi dengan ditutup kelambu hingga rapat tujuannya agar nyamuk tidak bisa terbang bebas keluar ruangan agar nyamuk bisa beradaptasi maka nyamuk dilepaskan dalam ruangan dan dibiarkan selama 1 jam untuk selanjutnya dipasang obat nyamuk elektrik larutan buah durian
1915023 uji coba kami pada eksperimen 1 2 dan 3 kematian nyamuk semakin banyak ini menunjukkan bahwa larutan buah durian ternyata ampuh mengusir dan membasmi nyamuk
1915024 karena prinsip kerja alkohol cepat terjadi penguapan apalagi jika terkena panas
1915025 sehingga tidak ada salahnya bekas obat nyamuk elektrik yang biasanya dibuang bisa digunakan untuk membuat obat nyamuk elektrik sendiri dengan larutan buah dan kulit durian selain murah juga aman bagi kesehatan tidak seperti obat nyamuk biasa

1915033 another reading of the proverbs text makes an ever deeper point the new revised standard version of the bible translates this famous text as when there is no prophecy the people cast off restraint perhaps that prophetic insight explains why a lack of vision in a society contributes directly ro social unrest lawlessness violence and chaos it may not just be poverty that leads to social breakdown but also the absence of any compelling and credible vision articulated by public leaders and accepted by the people that serves to hold a society together

1915204 boeing and british airways have a relationship that stretches back over the last 50 years and this order is a reaffirmation of this ongoing partnership
1915205 the 777 300er offers exceptional fuel economy and environmental credentials and will integrate seamlessly into british airways existing twin aisle fleet
1915206 in addition our key partner gecas continues to demonstrate confidence in the 777 with the 777s gecas has ordered in the last two years it has created five new 777 customers three of the five new customers have subsequently purchased new 777s directly from boeing

1915210 we are eager to build our boeing fleet with these additional 737s and 767s to meet continued demand for air travel in our region
1915211 todays order is yet another step forward in our strong relationship with boeing we look forward to operating the 787 and benefiting from its advanced performance features however the 767 300er is the economical and logical choice to fulfill our interim capacity targets
1915212 what is done in the dark will come to the light
1915213 there is not always sufficient emphasis on the relationship between the teaching of the church on redemption and creation this is an issue in which catholics can practice their faith giving examples with lifestyles respectful of the environment
1915214 but if one denies god the world is reduced to the material and in a world closed in on its materialism it is easier for the human being to make himself the dictator of all other creatures and of nature
1915215 when he was younger he was stricter and thought that it was a problem to administer the sacraments so widely with time the pope said i understood it was necessary to follow the way of the lord and be open to the mercy that embraces those who only have a hint of faith as well
1915216 even if we can only see a small flame of desire for communion with the church there is reason to go in that direction
1915217 true that it was not easy to read and accurately portray the personality of montini paul vi which was characterized by an intense strong and elevated spirituality jealously guarded by him and managed by his unmistakable style of gentleness
1915218 perhaps the press at that time did not take into account that paul vi took the second vatican council by the hand after its first session bringing it to a positive conclusion and promulgating all of the approved documents dedicating personal attention and precise interventions to the final approval
1915219 who desired to follow the steps of christ in the holy land and who visited all of the continents for the first time he is also the pope of ecclesiam suam populorum progressio octogesima adveniens evangelii nuntiandi just to name a few of his documents
1915220 the only pope to promulgate an apostolic exhortation on joy gaudete in domino 1975
1915221 august 6 1978 in castel gandolfo the 81 years of paul vi quietly ended
1915222 despite tenacious opposition and grave dissent in the church despite the merciless attacks and criticisms multiplied above all after the credo of the people of god and after humanae vitae paul vi never renounced the authentic magisterium and in reflecting on his pontificate he declared he had put everything at the service and defense of the truth and therefore he was always willing to defend human life
1915223 im able to use what i learned to give individually directed retreats
1915224 you see what the person comes to the retreat with and what they desire and then allow the holy spirit to direct the retreat
1915225 i meet with them every day and help them discern what god is trying to tell them in their personal lives from what i hear i then give suggestions for their prayer that day
1915226 instead of me giving them my insights god does it god speaks and they listen and they grow stronger in their faith which is the point of their retreat
1915227 its a blessing when you can see that growth because its very personal
1915228 im looking to see how the mission of the spiritual life center ts with the mission of the diocese how we can help parishes and how we can work with other ministries and collaborate with different of ces
1915229 i would like to offer a wide variety of programs to meet a wide variety of needs programs that touch the heart as well as the head
1915230 an extremist who has built his empire on the backs of gays and lesbians
1915231 it is an affront for the radio hall of fame to honor james dobson a right wing demagogue
1915232 the focus on the family broadcast was created as and remains a means of helping families thrive
1915233 if you were to analyze the content of our 32 years of broadcasts only a minuscule number deal with public policy issues and an infinitesimal number deal with homosexuality
1915234 based on his disregard and disrespect for human life we should question his insistence that hes a christian it is inconsistent with the biblical world view to think that not only is abortion okay but he goes so far as to support partial birth abortion
1915235 catholics vote largely on a set of conservative values and on social values on social values mccain has a natural advantage because of his pro life stance compared to obamas pro choice stance
1915236 this is a dominant issue in voting for catholics because of the balance of the supreme court the other issues are also important when you start thinking about the conditions in the iraq war that was a concern for catholics earlier its becoming less so so voters are turning to other more domestic concerns
1915237 weve done extensive polling of catholics over the years and its one of our specialties
1915238 i felt a bit anxious but seeing many many friends just beside me and the many prayers from bishops conferences around the world that sent messages to say we are with you and we pray with you thanks be to god i dont feel alone in this mission
1915239 the problems are not only for me they must be for all christians outside and for the church the church must be involved in finding a solution involved in helping the christian community to stay there and i have asked a lot of bishops to feel co responsible everyone must feel that jerusalem is his own mother church
1915240 we have had many bishops conferences and groups of pilgrims coming to the holy land
1915241 you will be surprised to see how prayerful how dynamic
1915242 greater awareness and intensity to resolve the problem than there was before
1915243 60 to 70 percent of the muslim radicalism will run away
1915244 we are happy to see that in one year more or less the politicians the international community have taken into account the religious aspect now when they come to the holy land they ask to meet us
1915245 they start to consider that maybe this religious leader can have an influence on our faithful and change the mentality for more cooperation
1915246 we cannot resolve the problems but we are sure that the politicians without us cannot solve the problem
1915247 partnership with our people and with muslims and jews we can create a new mentality for more peace and more collaboration and less for hate
1915248 for me the wall is stupid stupid the wall is a realization of many other walls in the human being before building this wall they had a wall of hate of mistrust of ignorance and they put all of these internal walls obstacles in something that you can see
1915249 it is not with walls that we can find the solution that we can find peace for all security for all
1915250 we cannot go on i think everybody is tired tired tired
1915251 but with all my respect to everybody i doubt whether we have right now very courageous leaders to make these gestures to make these decisions
1915252 by starting at zero with a new mentality a new education a new culture the church can teach the youth to live in peace
1915253 coincide with the reservations expressed by peru about this term at the international conferences of cairo and beijing
1915254 it is not exactly known who created the concept of reproductive health and how
1915255 the concept of reproductive health is becoming accepted by leaders politicians and doctors without any basis or further questioning
1915256 other intentions are hidden under the umbrella of reproductive health
1915257 such as forced sterilizations the hiding of information about the abortifacient nature and side effects of some contraceptives the arguing that pregnancy begins with the implantation of the fertilized egg and not a conception for example in order to approve the morning after pill and the passage of heath care laws that prevent doctors from having recourse to conscientious objection
1915258 sexual rights reproductive rights sexual health the legalization of abortion gender gender perspective sexual diversity homosexual marriage and emergency contraception
1915259 in order to give social and legal legitimacy to the idea of reproductive health
1915260 recognize the outstanding artistic achievement in a television or radio program or series which entertains and enriches with a true vision of humanity and a true vision of life
1915261 it proclaims a value centered view of society and humanity and it raises our consciousness
1915262 it is a great honor for us to be awarded the prestigious gabriel award not for a specific program but rather for our entire network
1915263 brought this network to birth five years ago on the wings of world youth day 2002 in canada
1915264 much has been accomplished over the past five years and our salt and light team of young adults is the greatest asset of this wonderful project of the new evangelization the gabriel award is a tribute to their dedication commitment and key roles in catholic media in north america
1915265 to come together and share a little bit and hopefully develop closer bonds with foreign militaries in a non combat type setting
1915266 originally when i was given the opportunity i thought it would be kind of a neat way to see poland but then i started doing research on the black madonna and the siege and i thought its part of a much bigger thing
1915267 its pretty neat to be taking part in this and help improve relations with poland and other countries that are here
1915268 we know that china is becoming increasingly more important politically and economically and also in the life of ideas
1915269 faith does not alienate any culture or people because all cultures are waiting for christ and will not be destroyed in the lord they reach their maturity
1915270 identified with these people and with the certainty that they will open up to the faith of christ
1915271 my son and his friends have become obsessed with this band but after listening to them myself i cant help but think they are an entirely inappropriate influence
1915272 i would like to apologise on behalf of the band to the people who were offended sometimes its just a by product of the show
1915273 the one thing they didnt set out to do was offend there was no intention to cause havoc they got carried away and alex was just in the moment
1915274 right wing conservative medias most powerful weapons against people who make uninformed decisions about politicians without studying what is behind the statements of the politicians and the media coverage that we are exposed to
1915275 i will end the world if all of you do not vote for barack obama for president then we would all have to pray for the salvation of our souls because the world would certainly end
1915276 the unchangeable supporters of hillary clinton ignore them and move on

1915298 i think its the most extreme measure he can take
1915299 judge giles treated this defendant as any other defendant would have been treated

1915470 this time last year natural gas was trading at 6 per thousand cubic feet
1915471 i am well aware that the price of natural gas is un regulated and beyond our control but i cannot stand by and let these calls for help go unanswered
1915472 declaring the energy emergency helps people in the short term deal with this natural gas inflation
1915473 congressional allocations for the low income home energy assistance program in louisiana have been declining since 2005

1915478 the present imbalance of energy on earth has placed all life in danger
1915479 it is time to return to balance and for this women must lead
1915480 this is important because life on earth has had to make do without a mother for thousands of years and therefore knows very little about the divine feminine and due to this absence humanity has been forced to rely entirely on the masculine principal of energy the energy of yang cannot by itself supply all that humanity needs
1915481 but you have had to turn exclusively to the masculine principal because the feminine principal has been absent absent for so long
1915482 that people today have little or no understanding of the beauty and power of yin
1915483 the great mother was driven from the earth long ago and people were told false stories about her the story of eve eating the apple for instance
1915484 stories that depict the feminine as weak as duplicitous even as conniving all lies
1915485 the mother is now returning and we the grand mothers have come to usher her in those of you who feel called to work with us will help speed her return
1915486 and the more of you that work with us the sooner she will return the world needs mothering now
1915487 we have explained how to work with us in order to bring about this great change
1915488 in our book a call to power the grandmothers speak use the book
1915489 study it and discuss our teachings for by doing this you will automatically start to live our message
1915490 and each time you do cast the net of light for your planet we have come to teach you of the power of the feminine principal of creation to teach you how to live this power
1915491 the feminine principal is your birthright you no longer need live in a motherless world cut off from the power beauty of your own nature this is why we have come
1915492 taking this path with us is not difficult this path does not lead to suffering
1915493 wake up you are needed now hear our message and receive what we have come to give accept the gift of empowerment into the feminine principal and pass it on read our message
1915494 live it and spread it your world is starved for the love of the mother and we assure you that she is returning and that we the grand mothers are bringing her back get cracking
1915495 wasnt it your earthly grandmother who gave birth to your mother
1915496 we have come to return the mother to humanity and we are asking you to ready yourself to receive her
1915497 study our book share our message and pass it on we have come for all
1915498 and now is the time for this to take place we have told you that we will do the work of rescuing your planet with or without you
1915499 but if you miss this chance to be part of it you will kick yourself as you say
1915500 we are here now is the time call us begin today to live our message we have shown you how come along on the ride

1915610 the sooner the highlands council is allowed to begin implementation of the rmp the sooner we will find the quirks and wrinkles that need to be ironed out the sooner we can actually get to work on the preservation and regeneration of the region
1915611 their organizations have supported just about every law and regulation that favors paving over new jersey
1915612 our scientists and engineers looked at the highlands act and came up with 68 pages of constructive criticism based on hard work and science these groups however offered nothing its outrageous that now they are weighing in on the issue

1915616 i hate living from check to check adding to not being home always out in the field the ridiculous stresses of the job often make me wonder if this is all worth it
1915617 i live in the barracks and even though i am good about saving money i am always finding myself eating meals ready to eat or pawning something of value just to stay afloat
1915618 there is no reason why soldiers should be eating mres or pawning things to stay afloat the job of a leader is not just to make a soldier combat effective but also teach life skills such as money management ok granted when we are deployed the pay is better helping out at home but lets look at the big picture you didnt join the military to be rich you joined to serve your country and sacrifice comes in many ways the military offers many things you wont get in the real job market if you take into consideration the benefits you receive youre really not doing so bad
1915619 how much you spend matters much more than how much you earn and in your case as a service member more than not youre staying on a tight path i have seen men coming in saying that if their car broke down the payments just to fix the car would have their family not eating saving just twenty five bucks a week can add up over time you just must be disciplined and always be thinking ahead

1915630 saya baru mengetahui jika sekolah ini bermasalah setelah membuka situs di internet disitu dituliskan kampus yang saya pilih untuk melanjutkan pendidikan yang menurut saya sangat bonafit tersebut ternyata hanya akal akalan kata agatha virdi
1915631 jelas kami tidak terima kami ingin pihak stimindo bertanggung jawab dan mengembalikan uang yang sudah kami bayarkan sekarang sudah tidak ada lagi solusi ataupun jalan keluar karena kami sendiri tidak ingin mengikuti pendidikan yang status pendidikannya tidak jelas tambah agatha
1915632 tapi jika ijazah yang dikeluarkan itu dikatakan ilegal dan pendidikan yang ditempuh semuanya tidak diakui oleh dikti ataupun kopertis lalu untuk apa kami melanjutkan sekolah di situ
1915633 ini bukti penipuannya kami disuruh membayar lunas dan sampai sekarang kami tidak mendapatkan apa apa jangankan pengajaran almamater atau buku panduan pun kita tidak diberi kata agatha

1915653 you watch the news and you get kind of scared
1915654 i tell my kids dont talk to strangers but i think if they hear it from police its more important they listen to them versus me saying dont talk to someone with a puppy the kids just pick it up so much more

1915659 you dont have to do anything special to get happy nothing sets you so much aside from the other happy people in the world except that theyre used to feeling good and youre not used to it
1915660 it takes practice practice feeling good do it a little bit at a time everyone has had a good feeling remember and lets re create yours take a deep breath let out the bad energy and the tension and then let in a good feeling let it sneak in with a sly grin for a moment just be happy
1915661 stop trying to be happy trying is all about effort and not about results just be happy
1915662 start letting yourself relax in the moment and have a good feeling just being there
1915663 remember that happen and happy come from the same language place so find the connection its there happiness lurks around happening so
1915664 the universe expanded exponentially for a tiny fraction of a second very early in its history growing from a patch as small as 10 26 m eter one hundred billion times smaller than a proton to macroscopic scales on the order of a meter all within about 10 35 s econd
1915665 nevertheless according to the criteria just described the universe that we observe seems remarkably unnatural
1915666 there is a skeleton in the inflationary closet at least as far as entropy is concerned
1915667 it would seem that the conditions required to start inflation are less natural than those of the conventional big bang
1915668 large numbers of particles would be created very quickly within specific energybands
1915669 this dramatic burst of particle creation would affect space time itself as it responded to changes in the arrangement of matter and energy

1915685 seems like scifi is going to air all 20 episodes without a large break as usual after the mid season cliffhanger from a producers point of view do you prefer this or rather a longer break between the 2 halves of the season do you think it impacts ratings at all

1915737 if the team can produce cells which will survive in culture it will open the door to a better understanding of disease processes without having to use precious human eggs cells grown using animal eggs cannot be used to treat patients on safety grounds but they will help bring nearer the day when new stem cell therapies are available
1915738 this is one of the most controversial ethical issues in all of cloning and stem cell research
1915739 in my view there is no risk of making monsters this way the biology will not work nor is that the intent of any of these experiments anyway so i dont think that fear is justified
1915740 i come down on the side that says if you can make great gains by making embryo hybrids in preventing premature death and understanding disease then a limited amount of such research is morally justifiable
1915741 in other news a star of a music video was killed yesterday while attempting a physically impossible skateboarding trick tony hawk will be flying down to be the funeral director now back to you jill

1915748 may we please speak to the man of the house we think the men would be more interested and would know more logically about the candidates
1915749 i have all the respect in the world for chad as a person and a player
1915750 he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time i really appreciate everything he has done
1915751 because right now my season with just two wins is i think ok but if i were able to come through on sunday and win this event it would make an ok season a great one
1915752 because some will go up the leaderboard and come back you know that par is a score that is going to be pretty good
1915753 i feel like i hit the ball well all day last sunday
1915754 it was just three or four holes there in the end and even the 16th hole i hit three good shots just didnt get the ball in
1915755 so i dont really look back on it with too much negativity i feel like i hit a lot of good shots throughout the day drove it great hit my iron shots close and i hit a lot of good putts that just didnt go in
1915756 i think after that start it was pretty good to hang in there fight and make some birdies
1915757 there were a lot of holes that were tough to get to and yet if you were patient there were some pin placements you could get to so ill gladly take it
1915758 ive got to keep an eye on him at all times
1915759 im ok everybody makes mistakes sometimes and i made a mistake
1915760 obviously rampage has some legal issues hes going to have to deal with but were going to support him
1915761 as far as how this impacts his career we just wanted to make sure that he was ok and now hes ok for everything else we really dont know
1915762 we were very concerned about him during the situation were going to help him however we can not because hes a good fighter but because rampage is genuinely a good person
1915763 i felt i was ready for a title shot about a year ago but there is so much traffic in this division
1915764 hands down its the toughest weight class in the world
1915765 hes one of the greatest fighters in the world so its a great matchup for me
1915766 im always looking to add something to my highlight reel
1915767 brocks a tough guy though and im sure well put on a good show and maybe ill win over some of these minnesota fans
1915768 no one ever says anything about it anymore im just a player on the team
1915769 i dont want to be treated differently i dont feel like i have to do more than any other players or do less im going to do what every other person on the team does and whatever i can do to help the team thats what im going to do
1915770 i just put my head down in the huddle and the whole huddle just started laughing but weve done a very good job of separating coach randy shannon from father randy shannon
1915771 they know im not going to play favoritism but hes always known that im the type of guy that ill support you in anything that you do if youre my son if youre not my son if youre on the team but he also knows the consequences of it he knows hes going to have to work hard and even though im his dad he knows im going to treat him just like a regular player
1915772 i have all the respect in the world for chad as a person and a player
1915773 he gave his heart and soul to this organization for a long long time i really appreciate everything he has done
1915774 we couldnt be happier moving forward with our media rights with longtime partner abc and now welcoming versus to the indycar series family irl boss tony george said
1915775 i dont know if it was a release of emotion or it just was everybodys chance to get some free shots in on me i think guys were taking advantage of giving me some rib shots and some jabs
1915776 im always celebrating everybodys elses at home plate and to get to be the one that jumps into the pile is pretty fun
1915777 he was asking about some of the mental mistakes that ive made and i told him it was a one time deal and it wouldnt happen again
1915778 everybody when they come here to new york wants to prove in a statistical manner that they belong
1915779 it will turn around for him and if it doesnt but we win the game what can you do its not like hes scuffling for a job or something
1915780 if you guys think this bullpen is bad go follow some other teams around and see what you come up with
1915781 he said when he caught the ball his foot was on the bag and his momentum took him off
1915782 impressive i would not have watched golf in this kind of weather she said
1915783 it was fun to see so many people out there today and that so many of them stayed on the course after all it took us five hours to complete the round
1915784 its my lowest round in a quite a while she said
1915785 ive had more bogeys than birdies in the last two and half months so this was really nice you have to be patient in this kind of weather its difficult to keep the grips dry but the greens were superb and i putted extremely well
1915786 one thing i try to do is to keep it even keel good or bad
1915787 hes 21 years old and he pitched like a guy whos been around 10 12 years
1915788 he had some big outs he had to get against good hitters and he didnt get spooked
1915789 sometimes it puts pressure on me sometimes you get wins with your eyes closed and sometimes there are games like this
1915790 some days we score a lot of runs some days not
1915791 were definitely not going out there trying to lose or trying not to hit
1915792 hes done a good job were six games over 500 since he took over weve got a long way to go offensively but hes really laid the groundwork for some of the right stuff offensively the guys like playing for him
1915793 i was kind of effectively wild they were chasing my fastball up so i kind of used that a lot
1915794 hes a young guy whos going to get better and better
1915795 for me being most effective i need to be aggressive
1915796 youre going to have those days when you feel a little rusty and a little off
1915797 those are the days youve got to work the hardest to get outs any way you can
1915798 those are the ones i threw right down the middle
1915799 some guys got base hits on not so good pitches but if you could take two back those were two bad mistakes in key situations
1915800 maybe it helps that way focuses on the pain more than oh i need to hole this putt and i dont want to make a double or make a bogey
1915801 you just follow the process and routine and you make the putt for par or birdie
1915802 i got an mri done three weeks ago the doctor said i need four weeks off
1915803 he was short on about six putts under 8 feet
1915804 this is like buddy holly the day the music died it is sad for all sports fans because this guy was not done it is not that he was hanging on
1915805 this is in many ways sad that this is where it came to at the end of the day though we felt like i think all the parties involved felt like it was the best solution to a very difficult situation
1915806 but the relationship got to the point where it couldnt go forward dont try to blame either side its like a marriage that ends it happens and neither party is at fault but you move forward
1915807 i think were all sad to see brett favres career as a packer end but we are glad that this matter has come to closure in a way thats good for the team and good for brett
1915808 i was just looking for him to tell me that he was ready to play for the green bay packers
1915809 and if we would have got to that point then our conversation would have continued and it did not get to that point
1915810 despite opinions to the contrary i like brett a lot
1915811 id love to see him have the time of his life
1915812 these are the marketing people that do direct mail the advertising ross said
1915813 they have nothing to do with the operation of the web site gaming nothing the government has launched this campaign against internet gambling unfortunately they sometimes leave in the wake the people who were not necessarily involved
1915814 hes an african american and therefore unqualified to be president of the united states of america
1915815 we dont know who he is or what he is about
1915816 the unwritten definition of proper patient attached to a breathing machine a lot of wires and completely sedated or even paralyzed

1915819 in fact any negative life event occurring in a state of relative helplessness a car accident the sudden death of a loved one a frightening medical procedure a significant experience of rejection can produce the same neurophysiological changes in the brain as do combat rape or abuse
1915820 disturbing events can be stored in the brain in an isolated memory network this prevents learning from taking place the old material just keeps getting triggered over and over again in another part of your brain in a separate network is most of the information you need to resolve it it is just prevented from linking up to the old stuff once we process with emdr the new networks can linkup new information can come to mind and resolve the old problems
1915821 cpt was developed by resick and schnicke 1992 1993 to target specifically rape related ptsd it incorporates elements of ct therapy and ex exposure therapy the cognitive component includes training clients in challenging problematic cognitions particularly self blame and attempts to mentally undo the event using the skills obtained in challenging thoughts and beliefs clients are asked to work on generalized beliefs emanating from the rape

1915823 if a moon base were to be built what would it use as a source of oxygen and water
1915824 weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
1915825 phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
1915826 were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
1915827 its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
1915828 the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
1915829 they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale
1915830 what nanosims brings us is a new tool in our arsenal of weapons
1915831 for the first time we have the ability to get in situ carbon and nitrogen compositions and potentially in situ isotopic compositions of fossil cell walls
1915832 as we go back to older and older rocks the chance of good preservation gets more and more remote
1915833 one very simple basic thing that characterizes all living things is packaging a cell wall or membrane that keeps things in and out cells have to interact with the environment have to metabolize change the chemistry control the osmotic balance and packaging allows this if we see a remnant of a little bit of structure even a fragment of a wall that would give us some confidence that we are looking at biological material
1915834 amino acids and proteins have a lot of nitrogen and cell walls are made of amino acids
1915835 if the nitrogen map looks virtually identical to the carbon map that likely indicates a cell wall or membrane we dont see as much nitrogen in organic carbon that has an abiogenic origin
1915836 the bitter springs is famous for a microbiota containing between 20 and 50 species and it contains all sorts of things with clearly biological morphology such as dividing cells colonies and long filamentous chains of cells
1915837 i had a thin section from the bitter springs formation hanging around and i used it to show what real microfossils would look like
1915838 we can see the cell walls and sheaths and their carbon to nitrogen element ratios
1915839 we are going to start with what we know and step back in time
1915840 is a particularly promising instrument for assessing the biological origin of cell fragments in ancient rocks
1915841 the potential to locate organic remains typical of cellular remnants characterize within them ratios of biochemically important elements and relate such features to the biology and sedimentology of the host rock could provide the type of compelling evidence for early life weve been seeking in the ancient rock record
1915842 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
1915843 detection of liquid ethane confirms a long held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on titan
1915844 the fact we could detect the ethane spectral signatures of the lake even when it was so dimly illuminated and at a slanted viewing path through titans atmosphere raises expectations for exciting future lake discoveries by our instrument
1915845 during the next few years the vast array of lakes and seas on titans north pole mapped with cassinis radar instrument will emerge from polar darkness into sunlight giving the infrared instrument rich opportunities to watch for seasonal changes of titans lakes
1915846 this is testing evolution real evolution not a simulation the molecules are evolving a new function before your eyes

1916030 conventional prior belief regarding the impact of fiscal policy on growth as the hypothesis that increases in government consumption defence or increases in tax rates lower growth while increases in government expenditure on education or infrastructure enhance growth

1916036 the way the system works is that the delegates choose the nominee
1916037 current fiscal policy is unsustainable as even draconian restraint in the annual spending on defense and nondefense programs are insufficient to guarantee that the current level of taxation will be sufficient to cover promises to seniors in retirement and health programs
1916038 lieve schat waar ben jij toch in godsnaam mee bezig
1916039 more than anything else i want my candidacy to unify our country to renew the american spirit and sense of purpose i want to carry our message to every american regardless of party affiliation who is a member of this community of shared values for those who have abandoned hope well restore hope and well welcome them into a great national crusade to make america great again
1916040 political critics who characterize him as banal and shallow a mouther of right wing platitudes delight in recalling that he co starred with a chimpanzee in bedtime for bonzo
1916041 its time we moved from good words to good works from sound bites to sound solutions
1916042 to encourage a country with only rhetoric rather than sound and proven ideas that trust in the strength and courage of free people is not a promise of hope it is a platitude
1916043 theres a supreme court case thats going to be decided fairly soon about what the second amendment means i taught constitutional law for 10 years so ive got my opinion and my opinion is that the second amendment is probably it is an individual right and not just a right of the militia thats what i expect the supreme court to rule i think thats a fair reading of the text of the constitution and so i respect the right of lawful gun owners to hunt fish protect their families
1916044 like all rights though they are constrained and bound by the needs of the community so when i look at chicago and 34 chicago public school students gunned down in a single school year then i dont think the second amendment prohibits us from taking action and making sure that for example atf can share tracing information about illegal handguns that are used on the streets and track them to the gun dealers to find out what are you doing
1916045 there is a tradition of gun ownership in this country that can be respected that is not mutually exclusive with making sure that we are shutting down gun traffic that is killing kids on our streets the argument i have with the nra is not whether people have the right to bear arms the problem is they believe any constraint or regulation whatsoever is something that they have to beat back and i dont think thats how most lawful firearms owners think
1916046 were not looking for a chief operating officer when we select a president

1916472 our approach this year to picking the ten best cities in which to live and work was simple look for places with strong economies and abundant jobs then demand reasonable living costs and plenty of fun things to do
1916473 living in one of the suburbs would be fine if an acceptable starter home was available for less than 350 000
1916474 there may be fun things to do there but the cost of living is probably only great compared to southern california or the san francisco bay area the price of homes in sacramento is still pretty high compared to other parts of the country
1916475 ive lived in sacramento for 8 years and the only things you can do there are live and work youll have a hard time finding play in that city
1916476 the real estate bust hit here harder than almost anywhere else in the country starter homes in decent suburban neighborhoods can now be had around 200 000 which is what they were about six years ago cost of living has improved dramatically or worsened depending on whether or not youre a homeowner
1916477 move to napa nice winters though i prefer the wine country and the delta area more though especially with bart nearby summer not bad though its far from everything e g san francisco
1916478 i dont know why sacramento is on the list it has crazy traffic pollution is no where near anywhere to play
1916479 overall sac has everything that one wants in a living place employment is plentiful while cost of living is low in balance compared to salary transportation public relies on county boards decision making and comes up short most of the time poor public transportation mid town is accessible to most everything one needs schools are wonderful offers classes in everything however there should be more phd degrees offered its hard to complain about anything here in sacramento
1916480 i see the glass as half full outdoor dining is awesome as late as you want to go sacramento isnt as cosmopolitan as the bay area and our outlying areas are as boring as anywhere but the central city is vibrant interesting and fun and the weather for most of the year cant be beat

1916501 connection to dishonor rather than culpability makes it a more appropriate response to sins that you yourself are only complicit in indirectly
1916502 i know a lot of liberals who believe we as a society bear a debt to african americans which is nowhere near repaid
1916503 and so we who have benefited from these injustices even indirectly do have some responsibility to try and right them
1916504 visionary minimalist may sound like an oxymoron but in fact and this is the key point obamas promise of change is credible in part
1916505 i do know libertarians who think obama is the antichrist that hes farther left than john kerry much farther left than bill clinton and youd clearly have to be insane to vote for this guy but there are libertarians who say oh yeah do you think obama will increase spending by 1 trillion because thats what republicans did over the past two presidential terms so really how much worse can he be and there are certainly libertarians who think obama will be better on the war and on foreign policy on executive power and on surveillance than mccain

1916522 consumers are hungry for more information about the products and services that they choose in their lives
1916523 they want companies to be transparent about product attributes and ingredients and honest about their impact on the environment and society i dont think consumers expect perfection but they do demand honesty they will reward companies that are making sincere efforts to do the right thing and take concrete steps in the right direction

1916526 at the end of the day we believe that when you align your values with your actions great things can happen
1916527 americas consumers will reward companies that back their eco friendly words with socially responsible actions the paradigm is shifting from driving transactions to building enduring values based relationships

1916653 our children are able to study their lessons and we are able to do our household chores even at night
1916654 without the electricity the children were only using candles for light in the evening
1916655 the children often dont do their homework because they find it too difficult to study under a dim lit candle or kerosene wick lamp
1916656 we reap huge benefits from solar power it adds to our profit margins because we are able to sell even at night
1916657 before when we were using a kerosene lamp it blackened our walls and our children inhaled the smoke which affects their health

1916660 we are proud of this building before mahayag looked like it was left behind
1916661 now no more people pay their taxes because they can see where their taxes go
1916662 the mbussp is among the initiatives being undertaken by the government to improve the quality of life in mindanao by institutionalizing the capacity of lgus to provide its constituencies with infrastructure and other essential services
1916663 project beneficiaries are mostly poor communities in mindanao who would gain better access to basic services in their respective localities
1916664 we had no terminal here in panabo we just used the old gym for the terminal we could not accommodate the terminal jeepney bound for farflung barangays
1916665 it became apparent that there was a need to improve the recycling facility and provide capacity building and skills training to the community
1916666 it became evident that to improve the work environment a new workspace has become imperative
1916667 communities like smokey mountain have been stepping up waste recycling programs and turning what used to be regarded as unwanted trash into precious revenue generating treasures
1916668 it has truly taken the effort and support of the whole community to make this new building a reality
1916669 the air traffic control atc tower is considered the most advanced here in the philippines even more sophisticated than naias
1916670 its better that you know that all the baggages have been thoroughly checked for your own protection
1916671 the minute i set foot inside the vigil house and saw the smiling faces of the nuns beautiful and happy memories of my school days filled my mind
1916672 there was an overwhelming sense of belonging as i remembered that these nuns played a big part in my formative years when i saw the wheelchair bound and bedridden nuns my heart just went out to them
1916673 i was teary eyed when i saw the nuns in the infirmary praying the rosary it was difficult to hold back my tears when i saw the bedridden nuns something made me move toward the nun at the end of the room her face had a certain glow that reminded me of the virgin mary i forgot her name but i remembered her from my grade school days at st paul college pasig canteen may all the nuns have many more years ahead of them
1916674 the infirmary ward is airy and well lit and does not smell like a hospital
1916675 since the oxygen supply is piped in tanks are not visible and the place is not at all hospital like in appearance
1916676 i feel happy that the nuns have a very nice retirement place befitting their stature
1916677 i know we made the right choice in making the vigil house our beneficiary we wouldnt be what we are today without them
1916678 its now our turn to help them and make their remaining years as comfortable as possible
1916679 its so difficult nowadays to sell we need a new livelihood
1916680 the project hopes to provide sustainable gender sensitive social safety nets for women market vendors and improve the quality of their working environment
1916681 its a place where we can get closer to each other see each other often not like before where we did not know each other and we were on our own
1916682 we now have someone to turn to and we just do not go direct to city hall if we go individually there is no action as a group we have their ear because we are more powerful
1916683 i have sold some soap and my family uses my own soap so we have also reduced our expenses
1916684 we are proud of this building before mahayag looked like it was left behind
1916685 now no more people pay their taxes because they can see where their taxes go
1916686 i am very happy that this project came to mindanao
1916687 its a big help to the women of panabo at the same time i enjoy what im doing
1916688 because he loves me and he knows i love my work
1916689 both national and regional officials focused on identifying and selecting the most inspiring effort among all the ecd project achievements
1916690 i saw that this project can help the people of catmon a lot especially the poor children in the farms before the program started when we were still a fifth class municipality we really had a major malnutrition problem so ecd was really able to help and our service providers were really devoted to their job even if the farms were far they would go and the farms here are in steep hills no roads and in really difficult conditions
1916691 those who are rich can afford maids those who are poor and have to work can leave their children here with me but those without work cannot leave their children here
1916692 this is my service to my fellow man i just want to take care of children
1916693 i just want to help no matter what the honorarium
1916694 i am also inspired seeing them cooperate because our vision for our children here in kidapawan is common we want our children here in kidapawan to be totally developed
1916695 in our time we were not things are different now now we say why is it only now that we have ecd we wish it were earlier so that our own children could be even brighter
1916696 they perform better and can already socialize because of the training they got from ecd workers
1916697 i probably won because of the cooperation of the people i did not know i won because i am doing this daily on my own this is my routine
1916698 we should accept all the challenges and we should be willing to work hard
1916699 by supporting her its just like saying i am supporting the people because i also happen to be a public servant
1916700 people here in the barangay are very lucky having a midwife like her who could be on duty 24 hours a day seven days a week they can always call her
1916701 theres no tricycle there and even if you ride the tricycle you have to pay the fare back and forth so you just leave early so you can reach your destination
1916702 they depend on me if i am scheduled to go there i have to go there because they are waiting for me
1916703 they appreciate the stories the toys and the materials that i bring because they have not seen those before i pity them because i wonder who will do this for them when i leave
1916704 some just give birth and give birth even if the midwife or the barangay health worker advises them to go on family planning they are stubborn and do not listen but when pes was implemented they were taught that they have a responsibility to their children not just to themselves because they need to feed them educate them
1916705 its okay for people have children as long as they can feed and educate them but those who cant might have to resort to child labor because they need money for their family
1916706 river ecosystem revival and enhancement through the utilization of recovered materials for energy carbon mitigation and poverty alleviation
1916707 the project offers these host of environmental benefits and provides livelihood opportunities for marginalized sectors
1916708 sedip played a very significant role in influencing learning it is also the stimulus which developed the schools with all the inputs learning packages and the in service training it revitalized the learning in the classroom the learning that the school heads gathered from the training significantly developed their competence to lead the schools
1916709 i am glad because with sedip all teachers are trained and sedip insisted that the first who are trained are the same teachers to be trained for phase 2 theres a very good tracking mechanism that they have installed for in service training
1916710 i was shocked i did not expect it mixed emotions talaga really
1916711 masaya po kaming nakamit namin ang pangalawa sa national achievement test dahil hindi nasayang ang paghihirap naming na araw araw naming pag rereview we are very happy that we got second place because our hard work in the daily reviews did not go to waste
1916712 it is not however the review itself that enables students to perform well on exams but the process of making connections and seeing relationships between and among lessons
1916713 by doing this preparation we can improve more maintain and move higher
1916714 dito sa pintuyan we are happy na hindi kami naapektuhan sa mga landslide iyong mga kalapit namin liloan san ricardo and san francisco iyong tatlong iyan natamaan talaga we are very thankful to god na hindi naman kami nasasama here in pintuyan we are happy that we are not affected by landslides the neighboring towns like liloan san ricardo and san francisco those three are really prone we are very thankful to god that we are spared
1916715 parents should also spend time with their children so that their children will be guided during study hours ideally after dinner at least one hour a day doing their assignments that is one way of encouraging them to study but when the parents are mostly working and only the helpers are there wala talaga epekto there is really no effect because education starts at home parents play a major role so that the students would love reading would love to study
1916716 it can distract from their study habits because most of their time they are watching tv and their study habits will be affected
1916717 if you are weak in english you are weak in all subjects
1916718 you cant compete in the world if youre not well grounded in english and reading it opens up to a whole world of adventure building the confidence of children to face the world and meet the challenges
1916719 she is always telling us to review review and make some strategies in order to sustain and maintain that rank
1916720 god allowed me to live another episode so i promised the lord that this time every minute counts so i am living on borrowed time making an impact here and there up down middle so that things will be remembered
1916721 my parents said we dont have food to eat nga mag donate pa ng chicken my parents said we dont have enough food to eat so how can we donate a chicken
1916722 be honest and sincere because we will earn the respect of the community we are serving
1916723 its an embarrassment to be promoting the city as environment friendly when there was so much air pollution so we had to make a very drastic move cut the tricycles into half and traffic was immediately reduced
1916724 the driver now will have at least one day or two days a week with his family and he will be able to maintain his vehicle
1916725 its not only the preservation of our forest and marine resources that is our goal here in puerto princesa but also for us to help in reducing global warming and this is through our efforts to prevent or minimize air pollution that is why it is very important that adb supported us with this fund to help us in our desire to become part of the solution and not the problem in the preservation of our environment
1916726 most people do not realize that there are so many pollutants in the white smoke from tricycles the very tiny particulates in the smoke absorb sulfur dioxide and other volatile organic chemicals which go into your respiratory system and to your lungs
1916727 day by day those pollutants accumulate in your lungs and finally damage your health it might cause asthma it might cause respiratory disorder many of you might not be aware of such health impacts
1916728 we might all be better off if we used less salt and pepper and focused more on herbs and spices
1916729 ive started putting oregano in my eggs thats not a big change
1916730 at first we thought it was the apples but it soon became clear that it was the cinnamon
1916731 taking cinnamon supplements for the purposes of either improving glucose control or improving cholesterol levels is not supported by the evidence that is currently available
1916732 larger studies may show that supplementation is beneficial but it seems unlikely
1916733 we showed that herbs and spices are powerful sources of antioxidants and anti inflammatory agents
1916734 about a teaspoon of cinnamon for example is plenty to get these beneficial effects
1916735 if you set up a good herb and spice cabinet and season your food liberally you could double or even triple the medicinal value of your meal without increasing the calorie content
1916736 government is too big he wants to grow it taxes are to high he wants to raise them
1916737 congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it were finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit
1916738 at the time of the merger no one anticipated an impact on jobs in wilmington
1916739 john mccain through this whole thing has said zero about his connection to dhl
1916740 whether its a vote changing issue or not i think it might be a little too early to tell its a matter of making sure our situation here stays on the front burner
1916741 one of the worst job catastrophes that any community in this nation is facing
1916742 we are going to need some involvement by the german government

1916745 well sweety a memo is similar to an email one person writes something to another person just like email sometimes one person can write to more than one person usually though the person prints the memo out on paper instead of transmitting it via the internet
1916746 am i explaining an unfamiliar term with other unfamiliar terms lets see will she understand the concept of printing on paper or should i analogize that to drawing with crayons

1916759 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
1916760 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
1916761 its just a ride and we can change it any time we want its only a choice no effort no work no job no savings and money a choice right now between fear and love
1916762 they said no problem you can send somebody by to pick them up and then we get another call and its whoops we dont have them

1916882 details in the statement differed from those given by the mauritanian authorities and the gulf tv station said it could not verify the statement was indeed from al qaeda security sources in mauritanias capital nouakchott said al qaeda was just one line of inquiry they said the attackers may have been armed smugglers who traffic drugs weapons and people over poorly policed borders deep in the sahara

1916887 one thing josh you were the biggest crier in the group this year
1916888 even when ive been hurting i knew it was a blessing being here
1916889 youll be a pop star all you have to change is everything you are
1916890 i graduated because it was the smart thing to do but i also made my family happy which is good
1916891 they know where im at and theyre supportive of what im doing now it fighting wasnt the most well received when i started doing it but my parents have seen such a change in my life and in me as a person and theyre really proud of me and really supportive im not opposed to going back to school but im gonna enjoy my youth and see what i can do in this fight game now lifes a long journey and ive got plenty of years left
1916892 i started my career and was just steamrolling and training hard for a year and a half straight
1916893 i was always competing i did 11 fights in a year and a half and i was kind of relieved to take that break i spent the whole holiday season partying and enjoying myself plus ive been running my business with erik charles teaching and training guys and then i got the biggest stressor out of the way and that was going to school now ive got all the time in the world to handle my business with training and fighting and im getting it done
1916894 at that time in my life a lot of things werent going the way i wanted them to
1916895 gono was such a top guy that i needed to be on top of my game and trying to balance school and everything else i was going through i was having problems with the team i was with at the time a lot of things were falling apart around me and i didnt feel the way i wanted to feel going into that fight and im not making any excuses i made mistakes in that fight and it could have happened either way but my point is that my mind was in other spots and i had too much going on to really handle things the way i should have and i think it carried over into the fight
1916896 i knew better but i was just in the mindset of man just get this fight over with and knock this guys block off already i guess patience is a virtue i dont really have sometimes i knew sooner or later that experience was gonna catch up to me and hes obviously far more experienced than me hes a great fighter and he got me theres no shame in what happened i think i fought well but i just got caught
1916897 i know hes got decent standup and has been around for a while
1916898 were both primarily strikers so its gonna be an interesting matchup and its obviously gonna be an exciting fight i dont plan on taking this fight anywhere it doesnt need to be ill start the fight on the feet and ill end it there before it has to go anywhere else but thats something that hell have to sweat im not really worried about the ground game or the wrestling aspect of it hes not gonna take me down and i definitely have the wrestling credentials over him so i have a lot of advantages in this fight and hopefully well make the pay per view telecast

1917009 i call on religious zionist rabbis to meet with the great rabbis of our day to reach an agreement on the issue of conversions
1917010 in the modern era the great rabbis see converts as a potential danger to the spiritual purity of the jewish people
1917011 too often in the rabbinical courts we come across supposed converts who never had the intention of observing an orthodox way of life this should concern all jews haredi and religious zionist alike we must unite and make sure that no considerations foreign to halacha taint the conversion process

1917059 while a 1982 u s supreme court decision entitles illegal immigrants to a free education from kindergarten through high school neither congress nor the courts have figured out what to do with the estimated 65 000 undocumented immigrant students who graduate from high school each year once they decide to attend college
1917060 i think politicians have learned that railing against the immigration threat particularly the latino threat brings in votes for the common people who get riled up a lot of their constituents i think what they really feel bottom line is that the movement of people in the world across national borders really is a threat to the kinds of rights and privileges they deserve as citizens

1917097 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain
1917098 he is a courageous patriotic american who stands up for what he believes
1917099 i know that sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
1917100 the mccain campaign is determined to give their paris hilton ad a run for its money in the desperation department and theyve succeeded only in shining a light on the fact that the john mccain of today is unrecognizable from the john mccain of just a couple years ago
1917101 the real question is what happened to the john mccain we used to know and why he changed overnight into a george bush nominee with a karl rove campaign
1917102 the john mccain of 2008 is not the maverick of 2000 on the most urgent national security challenges we face iraq iran and al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan there is no daylight between president george bush and john mccain
1917103 he has embraced president bushs failed policies and will continue them its unfortunate hes changed so much in just eight years
1917104 john mccain a maverick the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
1917105 john mccain has changed hes taken the low road leveling false negative and misleading attacks against barack obama john mccain is no more a maverick within the republican party than dick cheney is hes just more of the same
1917106 the john mccain of 2008 is not the maverick of 2000 on the most urgent national security challenges we face iraq iran and al qaeda in afghanistan and pakistan there is no daylight between president george bush and john mccain
1917107 he has embraced president bushs failed policies and will continue them its unfortunate hes changed so much in just eight years
1917108 rumors that barack obama was a secret muslim whose patriotism was questionable first appeared on blogs and in e mail messages
1917109 in march the rumors began to show up in the press though only minimally
1917110 i was reared as a muslim but converted as an adult to christianity
1917111 a nation divided cannot stand and that is what we are a nation divided by the hopes that war was the right answer and those that beleive that war is not the answer ebcause we have seen so many of our brothers and sisters go and fight this war only to not ever come back
1917112 vitality shows in not only the ability to persist but the ability to start over
1917113 ive worked with a lot of artists em and they all have a need that cannot be met by another human being
1917114 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
1917115 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking

1917120 you can have sex with some one because it fun not because you like them
1917121 cant let the young ins off easy so to speak
1917122 its so counter intuitive to find the internet restricted even if only selectively
1917123 there will be no restrictions on journalists in reporting on the olympic games
1917124 the coverage of the beijing olympic games and the preparation as well as political economic social and cultural matters of china by foreign journalists in conformity with chinese laws and regulations
1917125 provisions on the technical measures for the protection of the security of the internet
1917126 promoting the sound and orderly development of the internet and safeguarding the state security social order and public interests
1917127 if there are some needs to adjust on the chinese side we will do that
1917128 unblocked sites are still subject to the sophisticated keyword blocking system of the gfw the great firewall of china
1917129 its particularly reprehensible just days before the olympics at a time when china has promised complete media freedom
1917130 o google tem essa estrat gia de descentralizar a administra o de alguns produtos o google maps administrado em parte na austr lia e na alemanha

1917208 and the main line of the song hammers home the point
1917209 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1917210 in his new book the way of the world pulitzer prize winner ron suskind writes that in 2003 the white house concocted a fake letter from former iraqi intelligence chief tahir jalil habbush to saddam hussein backdated to july 1 2001
1917211 a military jury sentenced osama bin ladens former driver to 5 1 2 years in prison for aiding terrorism making him eligible for release in six months
1917212 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
1917213 by design those attacks put the american population into a state of intense fear of islamic terrorism far more than the 9 11 attacks alone could have accomplished
1917214 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing

1917287 nuclear weapons were created by humans and it is our responsibility to eliminate them before they eliminate us
1917288 there is much we still dont know about the candidates positions
1917289 both state in general terms that they favor the goal of a nuclear weapons free world neither of them however has discussed seeking to achieve a nuclear weapons convention a treaty that would set forth a roadmap for the phased verifiable irreversible and transparent elimination of nuclear weapons
1917290 between the two candidates senator mccains positions seem more cautious and sketchy
1917291 obama has come out in favor of removing u s nuclear weapons from hair trigger alert not developing new nuclear weapons ratifying the comprehensive test ban treaty and achieving a verifiable global ban on the production of new nuclear weapons material
1917292 well have major progress on nuclear issues no matter who is elected
1917293 it debunks the common view that obama is the most liberal democratic senator and it debunks the view that mccain is really the third bush term
1917294 adds significantly to the complications of controlling nuclear materials and preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons
1917295 obama also focuses much more on securing loose unsafe nuclear materials
1917296 both mccain and obama represent a departure from the status quo
1917297 acknowledges the unacceptable risks nuclear weapons pose merely by their existence
1917298 at the end of the day what really matters is how each one would respond to a crisis situation
1917299 while both candidates appear to take nuclear proliferation seriously the difference in their worldview is of utmost importance
1917300 the only sure way to prevent nuclear terrorism is to rid the world of nuclear weapons
1917301 in the seventh decade of the nuclear age there is a glimmer of hope that new leadership in the united states may pave the way forward toward a world free of nuclear weapons

1917340 the man that spends his whole life building walls instead of building bridges has no right to complain if he is lonely

1917346 soldiers want to be understood and they want to be respected for their commitment
1917347 i have become increasingly concerned about the growing gulf between the army and the nation
1917348 the people who make up that army are all volunteers and they fully understand that they join to fight and if necessary to put themselves in harms way to get the job done and once again i salute the memory of those who have lost their lives on active service or have suffered serious injury we do not ask for sympathy when we are doing what we are paid to do
1917349 now a great deal has been made of the military covenant in recent weeks mostly in terms of work load equipment accommodation and pay and balance is required here but the real covenant is with the population at large the nation
1917350 the covenant says that we do what we do in the nations name thats the way a democracy works and so soldiers do not ask why but they do ask for respect and honour for doing what they have been sent to do which they do with courage and professionalism
1917351 the men and women who go off to join the army or indeed the other services are not supermen
1917352 so how are they different and what pushes them to such acts of courage and selflessness
1917353 soldiers want to be understood and they want to be respected for their commitment
1917354 one wonders how many people have given to service charities this year

1917387 i see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country as a result of the war corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is destroyed i feel at this moment more anxiety for the safety of my country than ever before even in the midst of war god grant that my suspicions may prove groundless

1917441 so i totally freak out because there is no god damn way im spending eternity looking after a kid so im thinking its time for a mutant baby smushsmortion but bella is all attached and shit
1917442 so we go back home to get help from carlisle but apparently bella and rosalie are all bff now so the house is all divided
1917443 im edward fucking cullen does no one care about my view
1917444 anyways so i hear all the dogs thoughts and between bella dying from the mutant baby and me not getting a chance to have my pov i get really emo and desperate and ask jacob to do bella so she can have puppies or whatever werewolves and humans may have
1917445 i know i know wtf right lapse in judgement but i really didnt want bella to die
1917446 so were trying to be all nice to the dogs because the pack broke up and give them food and shelter and of course my bff seth is awesome about it but jake and leah have to be complete assholes about it all
1917447 so this pregnancy shit goes on for way too long not mention a bunch of really pointless and boring stuff with the pack goes on
1917448 then of course as soon as carlisle and the others leave bella goes into labor and then rosalie decides she gets thirsty for bella right when she is supposed to save the baby so im all
1917449 so i inject her in the heart with my venom then bite her all over then 2 days go by while she has her transformation and she doesnt move at all so im kinda freaked but i mean 2 days quit bitching mine was the full three and with way less help
1917450 so when she wakes up she is super hot which is awesome and i take her hunting and it turns out she can handle the bloodlust business really well so thumbs up and i show her the baby and warn her about jacob but kinda dont say everything
1917451 so bella finds out jacob imprinted and shit on our kid and nicknamed her after the lock ness monster so she flips out on him which basically just amuses me
1917452 so to calm bella down i take her to our little cabin the family gave us for some vampire sexin and she felt way better if i do say so
1917453 after we did it like all night yes ladies all night and even though it was only alluded too we went back to see nessie
1917454 okay you have to admit the stuff with nessie and me is pretty fucking cute
1917455 so bella is all bonding with nessie then that idiot jacob comes back and tells bella he fucking phased in front of charlie and invited him over so we try to act all normal since hes been clueless all this time and its like
1917456 then he comes and like basically doesnt care which is stupid but at least bella didnt eat him which was helpful
1917457 time totally flies by and nessie grows super fast and is all creepy too so carlisle and i do research and plan to go back to south america to figure this baby shit out
1917458 bella goes hunting with jacob and nessie but that that ho bag irina sees them on some fucking mountain and gets all miffed and walks away
1917459 alice has some epic vision of the volturi killing us all just when things are going okay so were basically all fucked then alice and jasper totally bail after we decide to round up more vamps to vouch for nessie
1917460 and its like wtf alice way to bail but we formulate a plan anyways and everyone goes off to round up vampires to witness that nessie grows since vamp babies are a big n o with the volturi since irina told them what she saw that day in the mountains
1917461 so all these vamps from all over show up and we find bella is actually a shield but she kinda sucks at using it so we are all training her
1917462 all this preparation stuff goes on for a long ass time i mean even im getting bored and im expecting to die soon
1917463 so then the day finally comes for the battle to end all battles but it goes on so long and the volturi are all corrupt because we proved nessie wasnt an immortal and bellas shield keeps us all safe
1917464 then alice comes back with another half immortal kid who is basically totally okay and stopped growing at like 17 so we know nessie wont die and now we know that alice didnt fucking bail on us
1917465 and like i totally knew she wouldnt bail because she is alice and she is too awesome for that
1917466 so the voluturi back off because everyone kinda turned against them and all is good again and we have a bunch of random new friends and charlie is totally doing sue clearwater now so bella knows he is fed and shit
1917467 i mean if he is gonna end up my doing my daughter when she is technically only 7 but looks 17 and probably end up having some wolf vampire baby i better get the jokes in now ha ha puppies
1917468 so everyone is all happy then bella and i put nessie to bed then i was gonna totally get some but bella let me see in her mind finally which was nice after all this time

1917584 one of the problems in our school is that in the past i have only gotten to speak to juniors and i have not gotten to speak to freshman and sophomores
1917585 most of us are kind of familiar with that little tiny school in gainesville what is it
1917586 for kids at this school thats kind of it there is no other college in florida
1917587 many of us are considering attending a florida school only if it is uf

1917592 hands on activity is what you can start doing now
1917593 anything will help to start building those skills that you need to qualify for those programs
1917594 i think it is something we need to be concerned about
1917595 if you have any cuts or scrapes keep them clean and covered
1917596 particularly with the young male students is that they use the restroom and dont wash their hands
1917597 they should put the soap in the wall because people keep taking the bottled ones
1917598 our custodians are wiping the desks with a chlorine solution
1917599 i purchased disinfecting wipes for the teachers so everybody has wipes in their classroom and hand sanitizer for every teacher and secretary to have
1917600 we changed our disinfecting of locker rooms from once to twice a day
1917601 i told coaches that they need to make sure to disinfect all football helmets and shoulder pads

1917605 i was reminiscing of all the good times saki and i had
1917606 i hope lamb chop is treated well and shes happy
1917607 i think that if you were to conduct this same survey in adults you would find out that they wouldnt be far off on the same percentages
1917608 this is because life is so busy now and people are not really into government
1917609 i learned everything that i know about politics by being involved in the pta and trying to help the school system
1917610 i think children and teenagers should be aware but its something that happens at home
1917611 if parents are apathetic and not discussing politics with kids than where are our teenagers going to learn about it
1917612 but at this age they care too much about how they look they dont care about whats going on around them
1917613 but i am saddened by the fact that a few people control the choice of the many
1917614 im so cool you need a blanket when im around
1917615 it was good to kick off the year with such well known songs

1917621 what weve done is taken a look at the schools performance and how the kids did on the eight tested benchmarks in reading
1917622 we picked the one that the kids had the most trouble with
1917623 thats the one we emphasized first we are teaching the teachers a strategy that is shown by research to be very effective
1917624 academics should be the number one priority in any school
1917625 its great to have activities its great to have field trips but its even more important to have the academics progress
1917626 nobody was prepared for it because nobody took it seriously
1917627 students are not running around in the hallways theyre not talking on their phones so much
1917628 i think we have already seen a lot of improvement
1917629 i think that dr sidener and her team have better planning they have higher expectations and they are going to monitor what goes on much more than the previous administration

1917642 mike huckabee as governor he never saw a tax increase he didnt love he presided over a massive increase in state spending including an expansion of medicaid and approved increases in the sales income and cigarette taxes on its annual governors report card
1917643 but his ten year economic policy record as the governor of arkansas is mixed at best his history includes numerous tax hikes ballooning government spending and increased regulation to be sure governor huckabees record displays an occasional deference to a pro growth philosophy but that is only a small slice of a much bigger picture the club for growth feels citizens deserve a full picture of where governor huckabee stands on the critical economic issues of the day

1917657 careful now dearie i can read those thoughts of yours
1917658 sorry about that bit of temper dames arent 100 perfect though we like to think we are now about the rest of those worries i cant scrub them away quite yet you must tell me about them acknowledge that theyre unwanted lurkers and swear youll tolerate their presence no longer
1917659 no buts i will not listen to anymore buts from you those trapped ideas feed your guilt with extra fodder and why what are they nagging you about
1917660 because because its because ive been such a terrible mother when my children were young and in need of a mothers touch and love i wasnt there for them i am a selfish and self centered woman i dont deserve to be a mother
1917661 you surely have a really bad case of guilt ill need to scrub you even harder by the way you dont listen to your guides do you once again let me tell you you werent acting selfish or self centered you were doing the right thing before you learned to take care of your babies you needed to learn how to love yourself and you fought for both your health and your life you fought that battle not only for yourself but also for your family and you threw out your demons using a large serving of mothers love the strongest kind of love there is cant you see you won
1917662 dearie maybe i need to scrub inside your ears listen up are your children happy fulfilled independent and do they show you their love
1917663 im scrubbing as hard as you need and as hard as i can now answer me
1917664 okay okay theyre happy and fulfilled and independent and i guess they love me
1917665 so let your guilt fall away freedom from guilt thats what you need most of all
1917666 we love you we love you and we know that youve always loved us and cared
1917667 well my jobs finally done looks like youre all spruced up now pure as a newborn but ill give you one of my spare brushes just in case you start carrying that nasty stuff on those shoulders of yours i want you to scrub it away hear me
1917668 yes yes i hear you and i want to thank you so much
1917669 well dearie you can thank yourself you did all the work you knew the answers well enough
1917670 why dearie dont you think youre getting your childrens literature quite mixed up

1917672 no one wants to be friends with a brand or company
1917673 armed madhouse and asked if kerry was aware that palasts investigations determined that kerry had actually won the election
1917674 had kerry conceded the election so quickly when there were so many obvious examples of vote fraud
1917675 was kerry refusing to consider bushs impeachment when bush was about to initiate another act of military aggression this time against iran
1917676 what happened in that auditorium was not only a physical assault but an assault on reason itself
1917677 all of these things have been eroding the first amendment in this country and creating a far more censored state
1917678 i think that these are things that everybodys upset about but they only start being vocal about when it comes to knock on the front door
1917679 because the governments established by the lord you know and thats what we believe in the christian faith thats whats stated in the scripture
1917680 i think now people are beginning to realize that this has got to be the largest fraud backed up by intimidation and extortion and by the sheer force of taking peoples property and hard earned money without any lawful authorization whatsoever
1917681 i know this is an emotional issue but people need to look at the facts
1917682 these men were convicted by a jury of their peers after listening to the facts as my friend johnny sutton presented them but anyway no i wont make you that promise
1917683 agents are not allowed to pursue in order to exceed the speed limit you have to get supervisor approval and they did not

1917685 everybody whos breaking the law flees from us what are we supposed to do do they want us to catch them or not

1917704 the latest clash of small town values including a heaping serving of religious fervor against what some here view as an increasingly hedonistic and dangerous world

1917706 ze hebben uitgevonden dat je een tunnel kunt graven naar het grondwaterniveau toe vanaf een punt dat l ger ligt dan het punt waar je het water gaat aftappen je hebt dus bijvoorbeeld een berg waar grondwater in zit en dat water ligt op een hoger niveau dan het dorpje in de vallei ernaast waar ze het water willen gebruiken de tunnel loopt als het ware met de berg mee omlaag en het grondwater dat bovenin de berg in de tunnel infiltreert belandt vanzelf in een reservoir in het dorp
1917707 in de moderne tijd bijvoorbeeld bij grootschalige landbouw is meer water nodig

1917717 the school district considers this project to be one of the most difficult
1917718 we have to lift these panels when there are no students in school which could only be done on saturdays after hours or on a school break
1917719 it has limited the student body in many ways and has made the years at beach high uncomfortable
1917720 the schools overcrowded everything is dirty cleanliness has been ignored
1917721 the water system has been limiting our ability to drink water use the toilets and sinks

1917774 dear give up those voices throw off those names too much baggage understand
1917775 i understand now damascus about the voices i can make them be still and disappear i am in charge of what i hear of who i am is that what you were trying to teach me
1917776 are you sure that old baggage is gone its weight can take fast hold of you make you unable to go forward you wont be able to make progress until you forgive the past focus on the present and plan for the future
1917777 yes indeed im a pretty philosophical fellow if only you keep listening well get along fine by the way how are your feet
1917778 theyre free oh damascus you know the answers youre wonderful
1917779 aw dear not wonderful but perhaps old donkeys become wise forever traveling strangers through this mysterious land now to be certain youve shrugged off those voices for good open your bag from le enchanteur and take out the little anchor
1917780 and just why do i need an anchor in the middle of this country i see no water anywhere
1917781 and youll need no water for this anchor to do its job
1917782 throw this net yes its invisible but it will do over the remains of the voice makers now fasten it to the earth with the anchor
1917783 you needed a mighty heavy anchor to hold down those memories dear
1917784 but this part of your journey is done now if you would please load that pack of tools on my back we have many stops yet to make lets be off
1917785 damascus where is this creek after all this road is owl creek road surely theres a creek my canteen is empty and im getting quite thirsty hungry too
1917786 be patient dear i was warned you travelers are an impatient bunch and thats truly true the creek is several miles yet a sharp curve towards the mountains and then we will travel along the cooling water then you can drink until your body and spirit are quenched and i shall greedily join you do you not think beasts of burden thirst and become uncomfortable yet i try not to complain and have you noticed that pigeon has been gone quite awhile it would be wise for you to pay attention to your surroundings instead of dancing about as for pigeon i daresay he has already partaken of his share of liquid refreshment
1917787 i am sorry damascus i suppose my human ness is showing
1917788 why dear do not fret do you not yet know a donkeys patience is seldom tested now look up ahead and celebrate a bit if you must here is the curve in the road see the stream it is ahead
1917789 pigeon where have you been i have hardly seen you this entire day you must stay with us for it is now dusk and our dinner cant be far away
1917790 do you not know my job in this foreign land
1917791 i am the look out watching the road for the least sign of danger do you think i am flying about on a lark
1917792 you better believe it dear now look ahead lights twinkling from a window we have come to our place of rest you rely on damascus and me we will care for you as if you were a helpless babe crying in your cradle
1917793 why thank you i do admit we are tired and hungry damascus said we should stop at your home i hope we are not causing trouble
1917794 trouble heavens no we have dinner and a soft bed prepared for you and accommodations for damascus and your bird friend rosa has a tub of steaming water for you to bathe in and dinner is nearly ready i shall feed and bed down damascus and i believe i have seed here for your bird go on in
1917795 i never got a proper introduction from dear until pigeon stepped in and now she questions my good friend what manners do these travelers have
1917796 i am barbara although my new friends call me dear i am pleased to stop at your home
1917797 and im tom tubby pleased to meet you dear now up and in over the threshold rosa is most eager to have some woman talk
1917798 no its been quiet and i hope it stays that way while we have a guest our dogs are out and about jess and jobie will set up a ruckus if they come anywhere near
1917799 can i help you do anything or would you mind if i sketch a bit and write a few words i want to remember everything
1917800 go right ahead dear i gather well hear your stories over supper and a treat that will be all these days passing with only a man to talk to gets a frightful bit lonesome though dont take that as complaining i love my tom tubby
1917801 i usually use the creek for washing but its not always safest outside the dark brings out all manner of creatures you never mind though our home is cozy and safe now go ahead and do a bit of writing your clothes will be fresh in the morning
1917802 lets dish that stew up and pile that cornbread on the platter why rosa it all smells so grand
1917803 my rosa is the best cook along side the whole of owl creek
1917804 and rosa damascus says our traveler has had herself an exciting time since entering lemuria were sure to hear a good tale tonight
1917805 why not go up and climb back into bed dear tom tubby can handle everything
1917806 not to worry dear tom tubby has a gun he protects us when the wolves attack
1917807 theyre gone rosa and dear gone for now im afraid they were after damascus but we fought them together your donkey is safe enough
1917808 why damascus does a sort of kick boxing didnt you know all the companions of travelers are trained in the arts of protection you couldnt ask for a braver donkey afraid hes got a bit of a wound on his leg though
1917809 now worry does one no good so lets not think the worst
1917810 rosa id like to bring damascus into the cottage to care for him hes a gentle animal and will cause you no trouble hell be safer in here if the wolves attack again he cant protect himself as he is
1917811 of course damascus is welcome let me get the spare blankets so he can lie down comfortably dear help me move the table and chairs against the wall so therell be room
1917812 the others have left months ago perhaps even years ago and i was sternly commanded to wait for any latecomers that would be you yes
1917813 why yes i have just started and i am very behind im so sorry you had to wait
1917814 and yet i do not know perhaps we shall have introductions as one does in civilized countries i have already met your pigeon and we have had a long discussion about your travels in fact we have made a pact
1917815 and just why a pact what are you up to
1917816 simple my dear you are a lone traveller a woman at that and you will need us if you run into uh unfortunate circumstances
1917817 i am perfectly capable as a woman traveler in fact i dare say women are better travelers than men
1917818 since i gather you are to be my companion perhaps you will be surprised by my capabilities in the wild
1917819 yes yes but we are wasting time perched on this rock your country must be full of rude people here we are having a rather proper conversation and we have yet to be introduced
1917820 sorry sorry my fault donkey this is dear although she will answer to barbara most pleasantly and dear this is donkey his proper name is damascus and he prefers you call him his proper name there now lets get you two down from this precipice i myself will have no problem i shall meet you at the bottom

1917826 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
1917827 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

1917833 those early settlers did not have the modern conveniences we all take for granted today to think how difficult it was back in those times to do something as simple as washing your clothes pioneer village has a lot to teach us all

1917838 hes probably the perfect example of why we should move the senior citizen age from 65 to 85
1917839 you look at where he started as a spaghetti western kind of actor as a john wayne or whatever and then to go on to directing and then go on to auteur directing
1917840 he has not stopped evolving and his artistry is ongoing
1917841 yes hes got interesting body language and a beautiful face but more than that hes got a beautiful mind and heart hes developed into a great director and each film is getting better and better hes amazing
1917842 i was working with an actor who was a day player on the set and the actor was a little nervous about it and messing up his lines
1917843 and clint said to me you know what might be a good idea is if you screw up your lines on the next take because it might make him feel a little easier about it it was the first time id ever been asked to do that by a director to intentionally blow my lines and i did it and it worked incredibly well and we just sailed through the rest of the day that kind of sensitivity is something that really is at the heart of the way he directs
1917844 even politically they think they know who he is and hes just not whenever i think ive got him pegged im dead wrong each time
1917845 you think clint you think fairly conservative you think republican or something youre not quite sure libertarian youre not sure
1917846 in may 2004 the height of the patriotism people are driving around with flags in their cars i sent him an article about the war the true story about the war that was scathingly critical of the war figuring hed call me up and go you commie bastard what the hell are you sending me now and he didnt
1917847 he called me back and said wow thats troubling material thats tough material and i said yeah but its the truth of whats happening to our men isnt it he said yeah so let me help them to get it made and he personally took it over to the head of warner brothers and thats the reason my next movie got made because he championed it
1917848 you keep working and you keep doing things and if you give out they give out
1917849 ive been telling you i want to stick it in you while playing starcraft
1917850 its fucking raining im going to cunt punt mother nature
1917851 during world war ii a group of jewish american soldiers known as

1917853 i tried to call you so you wouldnt worry when you got here
1917854 men who believe in christ and have been properly baptized are brought into a certain though imperfect communion with the catholic church
1917855 the spread of the charismatic movement has done a great deal to reduce the barriers between catholics and evangelicals
1917856 charismatic gatherings where the distinction between protestant and catholic vanishes in a christ centred unity of worship fellowship and joy are a further example working side by side
1917857 the genesis of the meeting seems to go back to a meeting at the de moss house of the prison fellowship
1917858 this is a case study of how a candidate can change a policy position in the interest of raising money
1917859 under employed to be making donations that large the official said
1917860 that john mccains campaign also has hess lobbyists as two of its top advisers raises additional questions about how mccain and the rnc came to raise 300 000 from hess employees including the controversial contribution reported earlier this week
1917861 hess oil would stand to make a killing from offshore drilling
1917862 berman and green were their lobbyists did they play any role in lining up these contributions
1917863 obama said a couple of days ago says we all should inflate our tires i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it

1917865 a televis o com tecnologia laser ser superior aos lcd em diversos aspectos
1917866 oh my gosh i cant believe you just said that
1917867 i think it is an important step that the gravity of the situation has been recognized and that there are some steps in place to turn the tide in afghanistan
1917868 whether that is successful or not is of course an open question
1917869 in terms of milestones its important to point out that no casualty is more significant than any other
1917870 each service member is equally precious and each loss of life is equally tragic
1917871 the reported presence in afghanistan of the head of al qaeda in iraq underscores the extent to which blowback from iraq is being felt in afghanistan
1917872 at this point al qaedas leadership seems to be looking at the afghan theater as the next big thing
1917873 the size of the operation and the ability of the group to get support within the town was somewhat alarming and it shows that there is clearly some concern with local afghans and thats a concern because civilians are the center of gravity in a counterinsurgency

1918119 the us believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1918120 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1918121 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labour rights not to antagonise chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1918122 ultimately only china can decide what course it will follow america and our partners are realistic and we are prepared for any possibility i am optimistic about chinas future
1918123 confident and purposeful alliances are the best way to advance peace and prosperity in asia
1918124 overall america has improved our relationships with all of asias major powers at the same time experts would have said this was impossible because of the historical tensions between these nations
1918125 when i took office there was no way for these nations to approach north korea with a unified front so america joined with china south korea japan and russia to create the six party talks
1918126 faced with concerted pressure from all its neighbours north korea has pledged to dismantle its nuclear facilities and give up its nuclear weapons

1918128 kang mingke an official with the citys environment protection bureau said there were no chemical plants located nearby according to xinhua he said the red water could have come from central heating companies who dye their hot water to prevent people from diverting it for their own use the news agency said

1918131 researchers fear more than half the worlds coral reefs could die in less than 25 years and say global warming may at least partly to blame
1918132 last years coral loss in the caribbean waters supports predictions that 60 percent of the worlds coral could die within a quarter century said tyler smith of the university of the virgin islands
1918133 up to 30 percent of the worlds coral reefs have died in the last 50 years and another 30 percent are severely damaged said smith who studies coral health in the u s virgin islands and collaborates with researchers globally
1918134 this report exposes clearly and starkly the devastating impact that human induced climate change will have on many of the worlds poorest people
1918135 that realization exposes an inescapable moral imperative for those of us in the developed world who have benefited so much from cheap energy from fossil fuels we need to respond with urgent and determined action
1918136 coral bleaching caused by rising temperatures has struck many reefs around the world hitting the indian ocean parts of the caribbean and off australia it occurs when corals living at the edge of their temperature tolerance expel the tiny animals that live inside turning colorless and exposing their calcium skeletons inside death follows unless the water soon cools global warming bringing temperature rises of between 2 to 3 degrees celsius 3 6 to 4 8 fahrenheit makes future salvation less likely

1918139 what was a particular individual doing at 2 30 yesterday and would get an answer
1918140 in my wildest hopes i could only have dreamed of a discovery as fragile and rare as this
1918141 let us destroy them as a nation that the name of israel be remembered no more
1918142 i watched as the lamb opened the sixth seal a powerful earthquake struck the sun turned as black as sackcloth made of hair the full moon turned as red as blood
1918143 the angel took the incense burner filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth then there was thunder noise lightning and an earthquake
1918144 at that moment a powerful earthquake struck one tenth of the city collapsed 7 000 people were killed by the earthquake and the rest were terrified they gave glory to the god of heaven
1918145 gods temple in heaven was opened and the ark of his promise was seen inside his temple there was lightning noise thunder an earthquake
1918146 in 1998 jose luis de jesus miranda avowed that he was the reincarnation of the apostle paul
1918147 666 tattooed on his forearm his explanation that as the second coming of christ he rejects the continued worship of jesus of nazareth
1918148 at that time dont believe anyone who tells you here is the messiah or there he is
1918149 as an observer of the conflict from iraq i see the signs that iran may be starting to launch the mullahs version of an armageddon exploiting the religious beliefs of devout shiites in the region while this may sound more the stuff of prophecies than international relations it is important to understand especially in countries such as lebanon and iraq that have large shiite populations
1918150 president mahmoud ahmadinejad in iran and the shiite cleric muqtada al sadr in iraq are both devout believers in the
1918151 in eastern baghdad where sadrs militias are based there has been a sudden appearance of banners and writings on the walls carrying religious messages that refer specifically to imam mehdi a large number can be seen near the interior ministry complex home to police forces loyal to sadr and reports are surfacing that sadrs militia is recruiting fighters to travel to lebanon
1918152 in this case it looks like the way is being paved for the
1918153 look and see for everyone is coming home your sons are coming from distant lands your little daughters will be carried home your eyes will shine and your hearts will thrill with joy for merchants from around the world will come to you they will bring you the wealth of many lands and what do i see flying on the clouds to israel like doves to their nests they bare the ships of tarshish to bring the people of israel home they will bring their wealth with them and it will bring great honor to the lord your god the holy one of israel for he will fill you with splendor foreigners will come to rebuild your cities kings and rulers will send you aid
1918154 now learn a lesson from the fig tree when its buds become tender and its leaves begin to sprout you know without being told that summer is near just so when you see the events ive described beginning to happen you can know his return is very near right at the door i assure you this generation will not disappear from the scene before all these things take place heaven and earth will disappear but my words will remain forever
1918155 there is now nothing in the law to stop women from being sent into the sex industry
1918156 the new regulations say that working in the sex industry is not immoral any more and so jobs cannot be turned down without a risk to benefits
1918157 they are already prepared to push women into jobs related to sexual services but which dont count as prostitution
1918158 now that prostitution is no longer considered by the law to be immoral there is really nothing but the goodwill of the job centres to stop them from pushing women into jobs they dont want to do
1918159 in the message broadcast by al jazeera television ayman al zawahri second in command to osama bin laden said that al qaida now views all the world as a battlefield open in front of us
1918160 the issue is the growing of pharmaceutical products in food crops grown outdoors
1918161 the chance this will contaminate traditionally grown crops is great this is a very risky business
1918162 god is going to do what hes going to do in spite of any intervention by the u s
1918163 his plan will work out but he does use world leaders to accomplish his goals in iraq i believe god used george w bush even though he bush might not know it
1918164 the bible says nothing about the country that is the present iraq invading jerusalem and thats what saddam was planning to do
1918165 the stage is set every action is in place and the curtain is about to go up on the second coming of christ but before that ping were out of here
1918166 today the best known is in the gulf of mexico where fertilizers and other algae multiplying nutrients are dumped by the mississippi river
1918167 these areas are fast becoming major threats to fish stocks and thus to the people who depend upon fisheries for food and livelihoods
1918168 iran already has surface to surface missiles capable of being equipped with nuclear warheads with a 1 500 930 miles kilometer range but it will in the future have missiles with a range of 5 000 kilometers which will threaten the whole of europe
1918169 ahmadinejad is promising the end of history in two or three years time and i suggest that we believe him
1918170 we dont have any good way of predicting it from year to year
1918171 my suspicion is were not going to see fewer of them
1918172 we have heard these things of the end of the world even in the days of our fathers and look we have grown old and none of them has happened to us
1918173 i have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer 16 for i tell you i will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of god
1918174 cuando habl entonces en 1985 solamente pod a emitir avisos de precauci n

1918176 una atm sfera de inusual agitaci n sobre la historia de la iglesia
1918177 asociados a un exc ntrico y joven especialista en documentos llamado mark hofmann
1918178 los medios informativos y los historiadores estabam teniendo un d a de campo especulando sobre la importancia de sus contenidos por lo que recuerdo muchos reportajes en los medios proclamaban que la carta de la salamandra da aba seriamente la historia oficial y las reivindicaciones espirituales de la iglesia de jesucristo de los santos de los ltimos d as
1918179 estafador de clase mundial as como un asesino y que todos estos documentos y muchos otros eran falsificaciones
1918180 la controversia genera buenas copias especialmente cuando es concerniente a una iglesia con algunas doctrinas que difieren profundamente de aquellas de la corriente principal del cristianismo
1918181 la mayor a de los medios informativos se dirigen a sus lectores o televidentes en una base diaria u horaria a menudo bajo gran presi n para ganarle a su competencia como resultado frecuentemente no pueden obtener verificaci n cient fica irrefutable de los hechos que informar n
1918182 un hecho hist rico individual tiene sentido s lo en relaci n con otros eventos fuera de ese contexto un hecho solitario casi por cierto llevar a una impresi n err nea
1918183 como resultado cuando los medios informan hechos hist ricos puede que provean informaci n pero rara vez proveen iluminaci n
1918184 ignorado toda la evidencia positiva y luego han gastado tantas l neas en descubrimientos negativos
1918185 cuando medios informativos o peri dicos supuestamente objetivos hacen correr una presentaci n o un art culo sobre la iglesia o sus doctrinas debe ser balanceado
1918186 una mentira es m s efectiva cuando puede viajar de inc gnito en buena compa a o cuando puede estar interrelacionada con la verdad de tal forma que no podamos determinar su linaje
1918187 en t rminos de los intelectual los lectores y televidentes claramente necesitan ser s sofisticados al evaluar lo que les comunica
1918188 por el poder del esp ritu santo conocer is la verdad de todas las cosas
1918189 les asegura a los lectores espiritualmente sensibles un poder de discernimiento que les ayudar a evaluar el significado de lo que ellos aprenden
1918190 la cr tica es particularmente objetable cuando est dirigida hacia las autoridades de la iglesia ya sean generales o locales
1918191 hablar mal de los ungidos del se or est en una clase por s mismo una cosa es depreciar a una persona que ejerce poder corporativo o incluso el poder gubernamental otra cosa muy diferente es criticar o depreciar a una persona por su desempe o en un oficio al cual ha sido llamado o llamada por dios no importa si la cr tica es verdadera
1918192 testificar del padre y del hijo y llevarnos hacia la verdad

1918206 oh its exhilarating it was such a rush you know once you run out the dog tunnel the fans the band playing everybody screaming cheering for you i mean its overwhelming
1918207 were coming into camp and it depends on how well i do in camp is going to determine how much i play im really praying and hoping that i do well
1918208 getting faster working out trying to get stronger in the weight room doing a lot of speed drills and agility drills trying to get quicker off the line and everything like that to stay in the game more
1918209 i feel that my major of consumer economics is more along the business line and i feel that you are versatile to do a lot more with a consumer economic degree and its not limiting you to one thing or another
1918210 foyers du mal qui essayent syst matiquement d roder la structure la que du pays
1918211 bobo came to me because i played a lot on special teams i knew how the speed of the game works
1918212 i just want to help the team out linebacker is real similar to fullback any way all you got to do is run around and hit somebody
1918213 kind of christened himself picking up the blitz which was very nice
1918214 my dad taught me i can cook up a steak or bake a casserole if theres any single ladies out there give me a call
1918215 he said hell think about it i might have to slip him a little cash or something
1918216 if we get down real close and were winning he said hell audible a little pass to me so that way he can get a touchdown and i can get one too
1918217 ya no se producen maltratos con los empleados y nosotros no apoyamos ningunas empresas que viole la ley estamos vigilantes
1918218 it was our first day with shoulder pads so we got a little more tempo out of them
1918219 one of the things i like about this team is we have to rein them in a little bit theyre not afraid to get after it they enjoy competition and thats a good thing
1918220 it was hotter than yesterday and probably as hot as the first day
1918221 we re awarded drew williams two nights ago and awarded benjamin boyd with a scholarship last night
1918222 im happy for both of those guys theyve worked hard and earned it its always a pleasure to be able to award walk ons with a scholarship you cant always do that as much as youd like but we were fortunate enough to do so with these guys
1918223 he sort of christened himself and his move from linebacker to fullback by picking up a blitz
1918224 if you asked me whos improved the most from spring to today it would be strickland
1918225 hes pushing for a starting job at guard with justin anderson entering camp i dont know if we thought he would compete like he has you look out there and just seeing how he carries himself in the huddle you can tell he has a lot more confidence
1918226 likely will shine in predraft workouts and could move up into the bottom of the first round if he does look for him to become a quality nfl starter in a 4 3 defense at tackle or a 3 4 scheme at end
1918227 he just didnt replenish quite as quickly as you like
1918228 theyve been here theyve learned a lot more hopefully i can catch up to where they are and be able to compete
1918229 it probably helps me to hide behind the linemen that we have some big guys and they do a very good job of blocking
1918230 i think i can get behind those guys and make something happen and make a couple of people miss
1918231 hes not going to make a living running between the tackles
1918232 the more he runs and the healthier he gets well get a chance to see what he can do theres no reason to believe hes anything less than what we expect
1918233 it was just an off day sometimes you have great days and sometimes you have bad days and today was just more of a mental day i had to get through
1918234 when it comes to competition when its one on one thats what i take my pride in and ill never drop a pass doing that
1918235 the most important thing in the olympic games is not to win but to take part just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well emphasis is mine
1918236 this experience i like ill have more of this but this one over here this is awful ill have none of it
1918237 call the world if you please the vale of soul making
1918238 the desire to be something special really comes about through the hunch or intuition of individuation there is the vague idea of being an individual and without realization of that uniqueness it is not possible to individuate
1918239 if you had to say whos most improved from the spring to today it would be strickland
1918240 strickland will be pushing for a starting guard position with justin anderson
1918241 he never really competed as well as he is right now
1918242 theyre going to line up and try to run it down our throats and theyre big enough to do it my hope is that we can be lucky one more time please just one more time
1918243 if they dont run and dont pass well really shut them off
1918244 i saw kind of a little hole and just sailed through
1918245 what we do is hand it to the big rascal and pound it at them
1918246 if we were solely dependent on herschel wed be in bad shape but if we didnt have him wed be in bad shape
1918247 i deserve to have him on my team after all ive spent years looking across at these great players performing for somebody else
1918248 all this is sort of an impossible dream for this team
1918249 please keep jeanette in your prayers shes getting her wisdom teeth pulled this morning
1918250 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
1918251 i think publishers have concluded the only games that work are the surefire 500 million box office kind of games like spider man and shrek
1918252 the transformers game really surprised people how well it did but the movie was big i dont think they expected the dark knight movie to be this big
1918253 the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small
1918254 we lost everything our house our rice our clothes we were given just a little rice by a private aid group from yangon i dont know where the government or foreign organizations are helping people but not here
1918255 the vast majority of families simply dont have enough to eat
1918256 the vast majority of people have received some assistance but very few people have received enough assistance to get them through the next three months and almost no one has received enough assistance to enable them to rebuild their lives
1918257 the message i want the world to know is that the government u n agencies and other organizations are making good progress
1918258 our operations are contingent on having a positive relationship with the government
1918259 so we have to work out a fine balance so that the difficult issues are dealt with but in a spirit of cooperation what we have learned over the years is that direct confrontation with the government is not the way to solve problems
1918260 still more bureaucratic and unpredictable than in the ideal world
1918261 i think thats where the needs still are quite considerable and thats where well focus the relief efforts over the next few months
1918262 every hiv positive person has the fundamental responsibility to warn his or her partners of it
1918263 who would have the idea of reproaching holocaust victims for hiding their status as a jew a gypsy or a homosexual
1918264 without approving such risky behaviours one can certainly understand them in such a context
1918265 youre doing a lot of fiddling around on this one
1918266 have you read the spec on this order a police officer has to be able to run five miles through alleys in the dark scale walls enter homes the health inspector wouldnt touch and not wrinkle his uniform
1918267 he has to be able to sit in an undercover car all day on a stakeout cover a homicide scene that night canvas the neighborhood for witnesses and testify in court the next day
1918268 he has to be in top physical condition at all times running on black coffee and half eaten meals and he has to have six pairs of hands
1918269 its the three pairs of eyes an officer has to have
1918270 another pair here in the side of his head for his partners safety and another pair of eyes here in front that can look reassuringly at a bleeding victim and say youll be all right when he knows it isnt so
1918271 i already have a model that can talk a 250 pound drunk into a patrol car without incident and feed a family of five on a civil service paycheck
1918272 it can tell you the elements of a hundred crimes recite miranda warnings in its sleep detain investigate search and arrest a gang member on the street in less time than it takes five learned judges to debate the legality of the stop and still it keeps its sense of humor this officer also has phenomenal personal control he can deal with crime scenes painted in hell coax a confession from a child abuser comfort a murder victims family and then read in the daily paper how law enforcement isnt sensitive to the rights of criminal suspects
1918273 i told you that you were trying to put too much into this model
1918274 its for bottled up emotions for fallen comrades for commitment to that funny piece of cloth called the american flag for justice
1918275 oh man my ass hurts but how fucking good was last night guys
1918276 hahaha i remember you i bummed you whilst you were in the middle of a room with 30 people in it it was sick
1918277 what your last dentist didnt tell you about those he should have im sure they were there a year ago
1918278 uh no no i dont i know i should but i dont
1918279 even people who floss every day dont have teeth as clean as yours youre lucky aside from the few cavities you have really good teeth

1918305 when the lamb opened the second seal i heard the second living creature say
1918306 when the lamb opened the third seal i heard the third living creature say
1918307 a quart of wheat for a days wages and three quarts of barley for a days wages and do not damage the oil and the wine
1918308 when the lamb opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth living creature say
1918309 when he opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of god and the testimony they had maintained
1918310 how long sovereign lord holy and true until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood
1918311 fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of their wrath has come and who can stand
1918312 when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour and i saw the seven angels who stand before god and to them were given seven trumpets
1918313 the first angel sounded his trumpet and there came hail and fire mixed with blood and it was hurled down upon the earth a third of the earth was burned up a third of the trees were burned up and all the green grass was burned up
1918314 the second angel sounded his trumpet and something like a huge mountain all ablaze was thrown into the sea a third of the sea turned into blood a third of the living creatures in the sea died and a third of the ships were destroyed
1918315 the third angel sounded his trumpet and a great star blazing like a torch fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water the name of the star is wormwood a third of the waters turned bitter and many people died from the waters that had become bitter
1918316 the fourth angel sounded his trumpet and a third of the sun was struck a third of the moon and a third of the stars so that a third of them turned dark a third of the day was without light and also a third of the night
1918317 the fifth angel sounded his trumpet and i saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth the star was given the key to the shaft of the abyss when he opened the abyss smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace the sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the abyss and out of the smoke locusts came down upon the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth they were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree but only those people who did not have the seal of god on their foreheads they were not given power to kill them but only to torture them for five months and the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes a man during those days men will seek death but will not find it they will long to die but death will elude them the locusts looked like horses prepared for battle on their heads they wore something like crowns of gold and their faces resembled human faces their hair was like womens hair and their teeth were like lions teeth they had breastplates like breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle they had tails and stings like scorpions and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months they had as king over them the angel of the abyss whose name in hebrew is abaddon and in greek apollyon
1918318 the sixth angel sounded his trumpet and i heard a voice coming from the horns of the golden altar that is before god
1918319 release the four angels who are bound at the great river euphrates
1918320 the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land and ugly and painful sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped his image
1918321 the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea and it turned into blood like that of a dead man and every living thing in the sea died
1918322 the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water and they became blood
1918323 you are just in these judgments you who are and who were the holy one because you have so judged for they have shed the blood of your saints and prophets and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve
1918324 yes lord god almighty true and just are your judgments
1918325 the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun and the sun was given power to scorch people with fire they were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of god who had control over these plagues but they refused to repent and glorify him
1918326 the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast and his kingdom was plunged into darkness men gnawed their tongues in agony and cursed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores but they refused to repent of what they had done
1918327 the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river euphrates and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east

1918341 it was a technical college we went to that they had converted into a temporary police station
1918342 they asked when did you first come to china i told them then we got more into details and we got into the tibet issue a little bit they wanted to know why do we do this to china now at this time i told them this is our opinion and in our country we are allowed to express our opinions in this way and we wanted to bring the tibet issue to the beijing olympics and this is our way of doing it they got a little annoyed at that
1918343 theyve been shown a side of tibet all along that they believe in their hearts we the activists have been shown another side
1918344 the reason we did it is because chinas government is using the olympic games as a vehicle to take control of the issue of tibet and sweep in under the carpet and erase it from peoples minds they dont want to deal with tibet at all its an occupied country illegally taken

1918353 the people of central and western massachusetts do not want to be dependant sic on welfare to heat their homes we are self sufficient and dont want to take handouts we simply want government to get out of the way and let increased supply lower costs if we allow new refineries to be built and if we allow off shore drilling energy prices will go down

1918468 i did not fear obscurity in my poetry because i had come to believe that the way to the universal was by means of the most intensely personal i believed that what we truly share with others lies in the deepest most personal even physiological core and not in the outer social world of speech that is used for grooming and transactions jazz and bop had convinced me that poets might also communicate by music by sound like thelonius monk charlie parker miles davis

1918487 all through school and university i had been given maps of life and knowledge on which there was hardly a trace of many of the things that i most cared about and that seemed to me to be of the greatest possible importance to the conduct of my life i remembered that for many years my perplexity had been complete and no interpreter had come along to help me it remained complete until i ceased to suspect the sanity of my perceptions and began instead to suspect the soundness of the maps
1918488 a iatromantis was concerned with indivisible oneness his concern was very practical what for us are impossible barriers were for him just places to put his feet when you become familiar with a world beyond the senses space and time dont hold much reality any more for the greeks the god of this state of awareness was apollo in his consciousness space and time mean nothing he can see or be anywhere past and future are as present as the present is for us and so he was a god of ecstasy trance cataleptic states of states that take you somewhere there was a single word in greek to express this it meant taken by apollo apollos ecstasy was different than the ecstasy of dionysus there was nothing wild or disturbing about it it was intensely private for the individual and the individual alone and it happened in such stillness that anyone else might hardly notice it or could easily mistake it for something else but in this total stillness there was total freedom at another level on that other level the freedom from space and time is simply a fact doubting it doesnt affect it in the slightest and neither does believing it beliefs or doubts dont touch here to convey a sense of this freedom one name given to those priests of apollo was skywalker a term used as far east as and mongolia in just the same way because the state of consciousness they knew is beyond time and space isnt to say that its separate from time and space by its very nature its separate from separation this has become so difficult to appreciate either we deny the existence of other states of awareness or else we put them in a hierarchy somewhere out of reach and yet the separation is only in our own minds these people didnt exist independent of the physical world and their freedom showed through at every level of their existence its no accident that they came from the towns and areas of greece most famous for daring and adventure for contacts with foreigners for long distance travel whats also significant is the way all of them either lived on the eastern edges of the greek world the black sea anatolia crete or were born into families that had emigrated from there and so many things about them are so close to the shamanic traditions of central asia or siberia that the similarities have been noticed time and time again nowadays this tends to create a problem most historians have their particular field of interest are afraid of what lies outside they like to say the iatromantis is a purely greek phenomenon and dismiss the similarities as a coincidence but theyre not a coincidence at all the particular kind of techniques used by magical healers in crete simply confirms what was already discovered long ago the closeness of cretes contacts with babylonians and mesopotamia and even more significant are the earliest greek reports about iatromantis figures reports about how theyd travel up to and down from regions far to the north and east of greece how theyd pass through areas inhabited by iranian tribes that were shamanic cultures in their own right adn then on into siberia and central asia just a few traces survive of the poetry those people wrote describing their own journeys but those traces ae informative enough they contain clear evidence of familiarity with iranian languages as well as with the myths of central asia mongolia tibet and thats only a part of the picture objects and inscriptions have also been found that show a continuity of shamanic traditions stretching all the way from the boundaries of greece across asia to the himalayas and tibet nepal and india we think now of east and west but then there were no real lines to be drawn the oneness experienced by the iatromantis on another level of awareness left its mark in the physical world even to talk about influence is to limit the reality of what was one vast network of nomads of travellers of individuals who lived in time and space but also were in touch with something else the way so many stories and practices associated with the iatromantis in greece have their exact parallels among shamans and the way they keep occuring in the traditions of indian yoga as well this is more than a coincidence what would soon be covered over and rationalized in greece was preserved and developed in india what in the west had been an aspect of mystery of initiation became classified and formalized in the east and there the state glimpsed or experienced by greeks the state that could be called a dream but isnt an ordinary dream thats like being awake but isnt being awake thats like being asleep but isnt had its own names sometimes it was simply referred to as the fourth turiya it became better known by the title of samadhi nothing would be easier than to think these traditions never took root in the west or to believe that even if they did they were never of any importance for the history of western culture but thats not the case just one of the people whose poetry has repeatedly been mentioned over the past century without anyone quite understanding the why or how as an example of shamanic poetry in the west is parmenides

1918803 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
1918804 cheye and trinity we support you friends and citizens of berwyn heights
1918805 i was completely stunned because those dogs didnt hurt anybody they barely bark
1918806 i dont want people to feel like that i just want them to be proud of our police and proud to live in prince georges county
1918807 can i tell you something and you wont get offended
1918808 my lord i have come to terms with my fate i acknowledge my guilt and for violating your trust i am truly repentant i have only one request and that is that you allow me a small amount of honor by accepting my apology although i will still gladly submit myself to execution
1918809 you are forgiven and your wife and children will be looked after
1918810 thank you your majesty but i should not be the one speaking his last words
1918811 icarus please save my daughter we will be fine here until reinforcements come
1918812 yes my lord she will not come to harm so long as i shall live and draw breath
1918813 thank you i suppose you were the best of even us
1918814 yes at the moment he is safe how do we escape
1918815 there are only two ways in and out of this building one at the rear near the execution hall and the one at the main entrance on the opposite side i fear we are trapped and must hold until reinforcements come
1918816 why would you betray the emperor where did the rest of the traitors flee to
1918817 oh i will not lie to you you are going to die either way for the treasonous act you have committed today assisting in the escape of men who were tried and convicted as traitors and then attempting to murder the imperial family oh believe me you will die on this day the question is will you die after being brutally interrogated and tortured for the answers you are so reluctant to give or will you reclaim some small honor and die peacefully by helping a servant of your emperor bring traitors who abused power and betrayed even the people they were charged to guide to justice
1918818 in one weeks time journey north to delios and go north out of the city gate along a small path they will be preparing supplies and a party to journey across the northern crater of worlds end and flee into the northern kingdoms with a large portion of their combined wealth leaving enough for their families to live well off for generations if you cannot stop them there the only place you may prevent their escape from is melost the last city in the north before reaching the crater
1918819 my lady the imperial guard loyal to the emperor have arrived i must try and save your father on the other side of the collapsed roof
1918820 please do not cry i will save him and bring those responsible for this treason to justice
1918821 genji sir now is not the time to ponder such questions we must apprehend the decatron before they leave imperial territory
1918822 you say they will leave imperial territory do you know to where they are headed
1918823 yes we must assemble a punitive force to block them within a cave along a northern trail outside of delios they must attack exactly one week from this day or else the decatron will move north the princess still lives we must take her to the palace so we may have an imperial mandate
1918824 there is no need for that i am assembling soldiers as we speak
1918825 simple we are going to kill the decatron i dont care how it happens but even if it means risking open war with the northern kingdoms we will follow them and not stop until i have their heads resting on pikes outside the city gates
1918826 we leave at dusk and will use the cover of night to avoid detection hopefully we can overrun them before they can even reach delios be there this is your personal duty as a member of the order of eris
1918827 oh now you are starting to see things my way tell me what is worse failing in your one and only mission of protecting your emperor or knowing that if you had listened to me you could have prevented it
1918828 good thinking you wouldnt be able to help anyone from beyond the grave i suggest you go to sambos estate and inform him of what has transpired im certain that your brothers would be more than willing to help in this crusade of yours
1918829 i had our traveling gear prepared for us because we were planning on leaving for gartouk tomorrow you know that rygar is serving as the duke for the region to replace the former duke
1918830 yes it seems like im being prepared to follow in my fathers footsteps
1918831 come now youngest brother we must reach the northern gate quickly so we may join in the chase those bastards will pay with their blood
1918832 come brothers let us go unto that lonely night and usher death itself into the world of men to rape the spirits of those traitors so they may never rest peacefully
1918833 it is the christian world which finally gave birth in a clear articulate fashion to the experimental method of science itself
1918834 the lord has established the world it shall never be moved
1918835 almost everyone now believes that the universe and time itself had a beginning at the big bang
1918836 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
1918837 at this singularity space and time came into existence literally nothing existed before the singularity so if the universe originated at such a singularity we would truly have a creation
1918838 through my scientific work i have come to believe more and more strongly that the physical universe is put together with an ingenuity so astonishing that i cannot accept it merely as a brute fact
1918839 a common sense interpretation of the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics
1918840 as to why there is spacetime that appears to be a perfectly good scientific question but nobody knows how to answer it
1918841 the adoption of one scientific theory rather than another sometimes in very crucial cases indeed rests as much upon philosophical presuppositions as it does upon the hard data
1918842 there has developed a general consensus among evolutionists that the evolution of intelligent life comparable in information processing ability to that of homo sapiens is so improbable that it is unlikely to have occurred on any other planet in the entire visible universe
1918843 life on earth at its most fundamental level in its most fundamental components
1918844 some cause must clearly be posited for this origin of the world and of motion
1918845 a proponent of the big bang theory at least if he is an atheist must believe that the universe came from nothing and by nothing
1918846 sometimes a parent has to go through great sacrificial lengths

1918854 i remember the time he was h gh and staring at ants in his front yard

1918856 i remember one time he wore bart simpson boxers on his head running through a party yelling golden grahams as loud as he could
1918857 he got us into deeper trouble with a cop when he was 14 when the cop asked the driver of the vehicle
1918858 one year of many he dressed up as the devil for halloween the little immigrant cleaning lady said something in her native tongue and then spit at his feet

1918953 the british occupation of palestine took place during my collegiate years at the english college of jerusalem i was one of the first to study literature i had a deep appreciation for the english and arabic language the near east broadcasting station a branch of the bbc stationed in palestine was in need of a newscaster who spoke both languages proficiently i was immediately employed through my university upon completion of my studies that very same year at the age of sixteen my parents arranged my marriage to your grandfather when the british mandate came to an end and war broke out between the palestinians and the jews nebs relocated jedo and i to cyprus we were extremely lucky to have escaped the possibility of living in exile in our own country we enjoyed our youthful years in cyprus until my eight year contract with nebs expired we decided to move to kuwait where several of our friends and relatives had immigrated to shortly after we settled i set up an interview with the managing director of the kuwait broadcasting station i was politely turned down as it was strictly forbidden for a woman to be heard and seen on national television i was disappointed my career as a broadcaster was over as i knew it and i had to settle for an ordinary job at the ministry of foreign affairs several months later the one and only male broadcaster who presented the seven oclock news had fallen very ill kbs was in desperate need of a replacement the field of journalism and communication had not quite developed in the region and finding a stand in was almost impossible i was contacted and offered a job as the first female voice on kuwaiti television and radio good morning kuwait became an instant hit listeners from all over the middle east would call in with their praises and complaints a saudi man once called in protesting that my voice was far too sexy for the morning news in an attempt to develop the field of broadcasting i was asked to train young professionals to gain the skills and techniques that i had acquired during my years abroad a young iraqi boy who was employed by kbs as a messenger boy showed great admiration for my work he would often stand outside my office and listen through the crack of the door to the lessons i provided i secretly took him under my wing and taught him all there was to know about becoming a successful newscaster years passed us by like a breeze before we decided to retire to london england the house your grandfather bought became a home we filled our retirement years with gardening cooking travelling reading and writing one evening after dinner in a rather ritualistic manner your grandfather and i shifted into the living room and turned on the tv to watch the evening news a dr najim ansar appeared on the screen before us answering a number of questions regarding his successful career as a broadcasting professional his name seemed very familiar to me but i couldnt quite pinpoint how i knew him then it hit me like a bullet najim ansar the young iraqi messenger who used to hide behind my door the interviewer continued to bombard him with questions to what or whom can you acclaim your success without thought or delay dr ansar promptly responded to the question at hand to a lady who had faith in me i was just a messenger boy who daydreamed of celebrity fame she saw my potential and committed to educating me inspiring me to further my studies he then looked straight into the camera with beseeching eyes and said if you know of her whereabouts please inform me for i owe her the world i was thrilled to hear this but your grandfather wasnt he took a few minutes to compose himself and calmly asked that i avoid such an encounter to occur the middle eastern blood inside of him boiled with anger jealousy and defensiveness i thought back to my formative years years of success and marital bliss my husband never stood in the way of my career the way i dressed or in the upbringing of my children even at a time where a womans place was in the kitchen my husband took pride in my place at the studio he was getting old and the alzheimers was starting to develop i nodded in silent agreement respecting his wishes now that your grandfather is gone i must keep my promise i can not allow these strange men to enter my home without the presence of my husband i am an old lady who has lived a life of fame love birth and death and want nothing more of my present life than a peaceful and solitary existence

1919027 do you remember when he shoved that shotgun in my face and said
1919028 it is completely wrong to suggest that our report was commissioned in april 2006 and the french indictments were in november of that year
1919029 throughout the report there is damning evidence and testimony about the french involvement on diplomatic political and implementation levels there is also evidence that the french army and intelligence groups were working with the government
1919030 they armed them the hutu militias and they supplied those who killed for us it is important that this comes out and that people are tried
1919031 with africa european leaders are willing to talk about darfur and zimbabwe but not it seems about rwanda european leaders need to be asked what they are going to do about this report as africas problems are not just mugabe and zimbabwe
1919032 people cannot be allowed to just say oh this is just another african country genocide is not just a crime against rwanda it is a crime against humanity and as such it should not just be about rwanda fighting this battle alone
1919033 in the political sense the french government greatly helped habyarimanas regime to prepare the course of the genocide

1919037 there was nothing good about this movie and it is perhaps the worst ever made
1919038 were standing there in the lobby all of a sudden we hear explosion noise and the elevators exploded like something out of a bruce willis die hard movie
1919039 people just come running out of the elevators on fire i was like what is going on here somethings up here i mean the planes up there now theres fire down here
1919040 we said somethings wrong here i mean the plane hit up on the 80th floor 5 minutes later and the elevators are suddenly exploding on the first level why
1919041 there was definitely a distinct time delay between the planes hitting and the elevators exploding
1919042 we got down to the lobby and everything was blown out exploded and we were the only ones in the lobby everything was exploded everything was gone were like what is going on here
1919043 it looked like a bomb went off in the lobby
1919044 we were tossed like a rag doll by another explosion in our building
1919045 people were making there way down the stairwells burnt like you couldnt believe we were all shocked because it seemed as if there was fire everywhere on so many floors it just didnt make sense
1919046 explosions fires everywhere is something happening that we dont know about here
1919047 i mean a plane just hit it wasnt an f 14 coming in and shooting rockets at us
1919048 i heard that myself stay home stay home so were like who is this guy to tell anybody at this point in time i mean from the first time we got to the west side highway we looked up and there was 30 floors of fire you got another building right next to it with thousands of people in it get em out its plain and simple here oh go back to work yeah now theyll never go back to work
1919049 to have us stop digging for our brothers on all saints day because they found the gold it was an absolute crime because you know if giulianis son or any family member was in that pit on that day then he would dig until china to find him
1919050 to stop our digging and then send the cops out on us cmon now somethings wrong here

1919064 the vacillation of data from one month to the next indicates a housing market in transition
1919065 the rise in pending home sales was broad based with all four regions showing gains this is welcome news because a rise in contract activity is necessary for an overall housing recovery with a tax credit now available to first time home buyers increases in home sales could be sustained with the momentum carrying into 2009
1919066 provisions to stem foreclosures are helpful but a greater lift to the economy should come from higher mortgage limits enhancements to the fha loan program and the first time home buyer tax credit
1919067 these are excellent tools that will help buyers get into the market to take advantage of the unprecedented drop in home prices in many areas as well as a wide selection of inventory to make an investment in their future
1919068 buyers entering the hardest hit markets in some cases with multiple bid offers may have put a floor on prices
1919069 in addition rising commodity prices and higher construction costs have resulted in a very unusual market today with existing home prices being less than replacement building costs in some areas home prices are projected to increase 3 to 6 percent in 2009
1919070 builders need to further cut production to help trim inventory however new home sales are expected to bottom around the second quarter of next year with slight gains in the second half of 2009
1919071 good to see paul keating bringing bacxk his usual level of intellectual rigour to things politic the thallium joke is as passe as he is
1919072 alas the hottest thing in california these days is the conflagration of its housing market with the dodgiest mortgages the highest delinquency rates and the biggest drop in prices in america not to mention the most foreclosures

1919133 obviously there is a scheme behind the scenes to encircle china a new cold war

1919139 like a mothball which goes from solid to gas directly
1919140 there will be no more room for nationalism than there is for smallpox
1919141 it appears i have expressed a common feeling a shared view
1919142 china was backward throughout its modern history so we were always seeking the reasons for why the west grew strong
1919143 we learned from the west all of us who are educated have this dream grow strong by learning from the west
1919144 weve been studying western history for so long we understand it well
1919145 we think our love for china our support for the government and the benefits of this country is not a spontaneous reaction it has developed after giving the matter much thought
1919146 because we are in such a system we are always asking ourselves whether we are brainwashed
1919147 we are always eager to get other information from different channels
1919148 but when you are in a so called free system you never think about whether you are brainwashed
1919149 the same bunch of goons and thugs theyve been for the last fifty years
1919150 i can tell you everything about all those movies like star wars
1919151 he wasnt like other kids who spent their pocket money on food he saved all his money to buy books
1919152 if he had questions that he couldnt figure out then he couldnt sleep
1919153 for us if we didnt get it we just gave up
1919154 it was famous we were proud of this at last we had a highway
1919155 problems with human rights property right disputes the threat posed to taiwan
1919156 but we chinese can use it to tell the people of the world that china cannot be insulted
1919157 up to now the chinese government has been able to keep a grip on it
1919158 but i call it the virtual tiananmen square they dont need to go there they can do the same thing online and sometimes be even more damaging
1919159 chinese tradition has many good things but weve ditched them
1919160 i feel there have to be people to carry them on
1919161 most of my generation has a smooth happy life including me
1919162 i feel like our character lacks something for example love for the country or the perseverance you get from conquering hardships those virtues i dont see them in myself and many people my age
1919163 for him from that kind of background with nobody educated in his family nobody helping him with schoolwork with great family pressure its not easy to get where he is today
1919164 leo strauss and the world of intelligence by which we do not mean nous
1919165 during the nineteen eighties and nineties most intellectuals had a negative opinion of chinas traditional culture
1919166 to assess a countrys true strength and prosperity you cant simply look at gnp growth and not look at the inner experience of each ordinary person does he feel safe is he happy
1919167 i sensed that this kid is very smart and diligent
1919168 now we started reading ancient chinese books and we rediscovered the ancient china
1919169 we opened our market but when we try to buy your companies we hit political obstacles its not fair
1919170 no matter who is elected china is still china and will go the way it goes
1919171 who can stand in the way of the march of history
1919172 we used to think they were just a postmodern occidentalized generation
1919173 of course i thought the students i knew were very good but the wider generation i was not very pleased to see the content of tang jies video and the scale of its popularity among the youth made me very happy very happy
1919174 how can our national self respect be so fragile and shallow
1919175 somebody says youre a mob so you curse him even want to beat him and then you say were not a mob this is as if someone said you were a fool so you held up a big sign in front of his girlfriends brothers dog saying i am not a fool the message will get to him but hell still think youre a fool
1919176 however the current young generation turns a blind eye to it ive never seen them respond to those major domestic issues rather they take a utilitarian opportunistic approach
1919177 we accept all the values of human rights of democracy
1919178 we accept that the issue is how to realize it
1919179 june 4th could not and should not succeed at that time if june 4th had succeeded china would be worse and worse not better
1919180 in the nineteen nineties i thought that the chinese government is not good enough maybe we need to set up a better government
1919181 the problem is that we didnt know what a good government would be so we let the chinese communist party stay in place the other problem is we didnt have the power to get them out they have the army
1919182 we really acknowledge him we really think he was brave
1919183 they fought for china to make the country better and there were some faults of the government but finally we must admit that the chinese government had to use any way it could to put down that event
1919184 you eat bread you drink coffee all of these are not brought by democracy indian guys have democracy and some african countries have democracy but they cant feed their own people
1919185 chinese people have begun to think one part is the good life another part is democracy
1919186 if democracy can really give you the good life thats good but without democracy if we can still have the good life why should we choose democracy
1919187 at duke university grace wang a chinese freshman tried to mediate between pro tibet and pro china protesters on campus
1919188 i really dont know where she is and i think its better for me not to know
1919189 when people cant express themselves in real life what can they do they definitely have to express their anger toward someone im far away they dont know me so they dont feel sorry about it they say whatever they want
1919190 this is just like what happened in the cultural revolution
1919191 think about how deng xiaoping was treated at that time and then in just ten years things had changed completely
1919192 the accumulated desire for expression just like when a flood suddenly races into a breach
1919193 are acutely aware that their country whose resurgence they feel and admire has no principle to guide it
1919194 some of them see that liberalism in the west has lost its belief in itself and they turn to leo strauss for conservatism that is based on principle on natural right this conservatism is distinct from a status quo conservatism because they are not satisfied with a country that has only a status quo and not a principle
1919195 look at the people everyone thinks this is their own olympics
1919196 when i stand here i can feel deeply the common emotion of chinese youth
1919197 believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality
1919198 were an empire now and when we act we create our own reality and while youre studying that reality judiciously as you will well act again creating other new realities which you can study too and thats how things will sort out were historys actors and you all of you will be left to just study what we do

1919236 describe how to determine the height of a skyscraper with a barometer
1919237 you tie a long piece of string to the neck of the barometer then lower the barometer from the roof of the skyscraper to the ground the length of the string plus the length of the barometer will equal the height of the building
1919238 firstly you could take the barometer up to the roof of the skyscraper drop it over the edge and measure the time it takes to reach the ground the height of the building can then be worked out from the formula h 0 5g x t squared but bad luck on the barometer
1919239 or if the sun is shining you could measure the height of the barometer then set it on end and measure the length of its shadow then you measure the length of the skyscrapers shadow and thereafter it is a simple matter of proportional arithmetic to work out the height of the skyscraper
1919240 but if you wanted to be highly scientific about it you could tie a short piece of string to the barometer and swing it like a pendulum first at ground level and then on the roof of the skyscraper the height is worked out by the difference in the gravitational restoring force t 2 pi sqr root l g
1919241 or if the skyscraper has an outside emergency staircase it would be easier to walk up it and mark off the height of the skyscraper in barometer lengths then add them up
1919242 if you merely wanted to be boring and orthodox about it of course you could use the barometer to measure the air pressure on the roof of the skyscraper and on the ground and convert the difference in millibars into feet to give the height of the building
1919243 but since we are constantly being exhorted to exercise independence of mind and apply scientific methods undoubtedly the best way would be to knock on the janitors door and say to him if you would like a nice new barometer i will give you this one if you tell me the height of this skyscraper
1919244 didnt have a camera by my side this time hopin i could see the world through both my eyes
1919245 self why dont you go take that inventory it might be interesting
1919246 i was glued into gossip girl from day one i think it truly is the probably to the consternation of certain people on the upper east side they really get it its a pretty clear picture of how a lot of these kids really are
1919247 expectant mothers are dieting and exercising to excess as they try to mimic hollywood stars with svelte figures weeks after giving birth
1919248 this is an indictment for failure to disclose gifts that are controversial in terms of whether they were or were not gifts its not bribery its not some corruption its not some extreme felony
1919249 we gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name and yet you have filled jerusalem with your teaching and intend to bring this mans blood upon us
1919250 the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom you had put to death by hanging him on a cross
1919251 he is the one whom god exalted to his right hand as a prince and a savior to grant repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins
1919252 and we are witnesses of these things and so is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him
1919253 men of israel take care what you propose to do with these men
1919254 for some time ago theudas rose up claiming to be somebody and a group of about four hundred men joined up with him
1919255 after this man judas of galilee rose up in the days of the census and drew away some people after him he too perished and all those who followed him were scattered
1919256 so in the present case i say to you stay away from these men and let them alone for if this plan or action is of men it will be overthrown but if it is of god you will not be able to overthrow them or else you may even be found fighting against god
1919257 phil always wanted to be somebody in the outlaw biker world and hes been hiding behind the cross for a long time
1919258 when he began recruiting members he figured the badder they were the better
1919259 they feel theyre reaching a kind of person the larger religious community cant reach
1919260 a lot of people on the margins of society may have been helped but they are not always aware of the tentacles that an organization like this can have on their lives
1919261 i guess you can go into those doors down here and see what they can do for you
1919262 he already has his ticket his flight was delayed hes here and ready to go i cant just tell him to leave

1919266 its just like the people in this book eg the oppressed celie theyre prevalent but you dont see them
1919267 novels are like dreams when you dream everybody in the dream is you
1919268 somehow you managed to overlooked this large clue bomb dropped on your heads and screwed it up and use non inclusive language anyway
1919269 how could an all loving god allows so much sickness and death into this world
1919270 let the word of god always be the standard judge everything by the word of god not the word of god by things the world may bring to you
1919271 im not afraid of dying i just dont want to be there when it happens
1919272 its like in the great stories mr frodo the ones that really mattered full of darkness and danger they were and sometimes you didnt want to know the end because how could the end be happy how could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened but in the end its only a passing thing this shadow even darkness must pass a new day will come and when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer those are the stories that meant something even if you were too small to understand why but i think mr frdo i do understand i know the folk in those stories had lots of chances to turn back only they didnt because they were holding on to something
1919273 tthat there is some good in this world mr frodo and its worth fighting for

1919391 i went on to tell about the increasing raids by rogues and how they were being blamed on the village i explained how that was not possible because the rogue attacks were centered around the lake and not anywhere near the village itself then i told them about my patrols these past three months and how the rogues seem to know if anyone with a med alert bracelet is around even on an air sled they always know far enough in advance that they are able to hide out of sight before i could get there even in the winter they left tracks in the snow but there were hardly any sitings by any of us and that was strange given so many tracks then i mentioned whenever i tried for a closer look at some of those tracks the dispatcher always radioed me with new orders
1919392 the entire council of elders was really listening to me by then
1919393 i really had their attention i expressed my conviction that the rogues couldnt be villagers because the villagers didnt have any technology then i reminded them of the rumors that the city was planning to take military action against the village because of these same rogue attacks something was not right i told how crow had found out about it and gone back to his village to warn them of a possible attack and massacre like what had happened at the lake the elders looked sharply at each other and there was electricity in the chamber the council of elders was silent for a long time after i stopped speaking then it seemed everyone was trying to talk at once
1919394 after many questions and long deliberations the council of elders decided to send its own delegation to the village and determine for itself the true nature of the situation i went along because of what i knew and four others were selected we left immediately before anyone could stop us
1919395 we made our way to the village and were surprised that they were expecting us we were given a royal welcome and had the opportunity to question all five of the group members who were in fine health and planning to stay for at least another month i tried to talk with howling wolf privately but he brushed me aside saying it was not time yet for us to talk he would contact us later at a better time we stayed for two days asking questions about the rogues the villagers told us they also suffered from rogue attacks that were getting more frequent and violent they told us there was a rumor the clansmen were responsible because of this there was a growing resentment toward the clansmen the villagers were relieved when crow told them we were innocent
1919396 still the question remained who was responsible for the growing rogue attacks it was that dark thought we took back with us the next day to our base camp we just got home when we were arrested and interrogated we were held an entire week before we were released
1919397 we dont even know who we were held by except that they held us captives in our own base in the mountain who ever runs the mountain complex is really angry with us the good news
1919398 is that the village is probably going to be safe for the time being too many of us know the truth about it and they cant be blamed any more for the rogue attacks
1919399 when we were finally released we made our report to the council of elders to say that the council of elders was pretty shook up was an understatement
1919400 ive never seen them so furious masters or medics serve no longer than three years before becoming citizens so the elders are actually pretty young and none of us had ever heard of such blatant interference into our own affairs we are going to make a formal complaint to the city itself as soon as we figure out how to get in contact it appears there are no known channels to contact the city or the city government inquiries of the medical staff at the emergency room in the hospital produced no solutions
1919401 the council of elders established a committee to research the issue and report back next month with available options that was how it was left it seems a very big can of worms has been opened and there is no ready solution
1919402 ive got my sixth chevron and get my master initiation in two weeks
1919403 maybe you can give me a ride on your air sled

1919436 emily lifted her eyes from the brown squares of land carved up by rivers and roads
1919437 and at a height of three miles sitting above the clouds i felt like an airborne seed from the cracks in the earth the rivers pinched back at the sun they shone out like smelters puddles and then they took a crust and were covered over as for the vegetable kingdom it hardly existed from the air it looked to me no more than an inch in height and i dreamed down at the clouds and thought that when i was a kid i had dreamed up at them and having dreamed at the clouds from both sides as no other generation of men has done one should be able to accept his death very easily

1919457 its tough because there have been athletes who have looked the american media in the eye and said i have not taken drugs and i never had and then a year later theyre in jail or theyre crying because they admit they have taken drugs
1919458 its unfair that that has happened and the minute that anyone does anything well or out of the ordinary its assumed right away that theyve taken drugs obviously ive been accused of that
1919459 i would love in about five or seven years when they retest the blood and urine that ive given to sit down with those naysayers and say ok i want an apology now
1919460 he was on a quest to meet me and he was like i think youre beautiful and i really like you

1919462 i was rebelling against everything nick wanted me to be
1919463 since the breakup ive realized that ive met so many great guys but i like being the girl nobody can have

1919469 lots of chinese people put powdered medicine into their wine as some medicines are absorbed better into the body if in wine

1919471 we highly value our relationship with ms knowles it is categorically untrue that loreal paris altered ms knowles features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
1919472 the stark revelations of the last few days have reminded us yet again that we have terrorists in our midst still planning awful deeds
1919473 we must therefore never relax our vigilance against these extremists
1919474 let me assure kenyans that this government will do everything possible to prevent us from ever again being attacked

1919477 we see them as they were as the opening of a new twilight struggle between hope and fear peace and hatred freedom and tyranny a struggle that has now finally fully been joined
1919478 and on that day we saw in response from our diplomats and development workers our soldiers and our citizens our friends and our allies what is best in humankind and why we shared why our shared values will prevail
1919479 the most important thing from my point of view is there were no new safety issues that emerged with longer exposure of the patients

1919508 youre going to have those days when you feel a little rusty and a little off
1919509 those are the days youve got to work the hardest to get outs any way you can
1919510 those are the ones i threw right down the middle
1919511 some guys got base hits on not so good pitches but if you could take two back those were two bad mistakes in key situations
1919512 because right now my season with just two wins is i think ok but if i were able to come through on sunday and win this event it would make an ok season a great one
1919513 because some will go up the leaderboard and come back you know that par is a score that is going to be pretty good
1919514 i feel like i hit the ball well all day last sunday
1919515 it was just three or four holes there in the end and even the 16th hole i hit three good shots just didnt get the ball in
1919516 so i dont really look back on it with too much negativity i feel like i hit a lot of good shots throughout the day drove it great hit my iron shots close and i hit a lot of good putts that just didnt go in
1919517 i think after that start it was pretty good to hang in there fight and make some birdies
1919518 there were a lot of holes that were tough to get to and yet if you were patient there were some pin placements you could get to so ill gladly take it
1919519 its the economy stupid we are in a recession sales and profit margin are falling year over year at sears commercial real estate values are falling eddie wil unlikely sell any property at an attractive price anytime soon in recent years under the leadership of eddie lampert sears cut marketing expenses to the bone theres nothing left to cut in its latest quarter ended may 3 2008 the company posted a pretax loss of 64 million vs pretax income of 381 million in the same period last year as the economy gets tough for some extended period and the housing bust continues to get worse departement stores like sears will lose more business to the discount retailers it will be increasingly more diffcult to turn a profit at sears and k mart sears holding has bought back 2 96 billion dollars worth of stock in 2007 and that leaves sears with very little or no money on hand to endure an economic downturn that stress has clearly shown up in its latest quarter as it had to borrow 646 million dollars in short term commercial paper to cover some cash flow issues i have a hard time believing that sears will turn a profit this year with almost 10 billion dollars in total current liability and only 13 billion dollars in current assets mainly comprised of 10 3 billion in inventory a bankruptcy filing for sears holdings is a real possibility in the next two years if it continues to struggle
1919520 lands end was not such a gem when sears acquired the company in 2002 for 1
1919521 ive done everything i can and im very confident ive managed the problem ive had well i wouldnt be doing it unless i thought it was as good as it could be
1919522 it just goes back to what you do around any other racing situation its the olympics you just want to make sure youre not rushing around too much and getting too caught up in the hype
1919523 you keep things very simple thats what has always worked well for me in the past
1919524 i draw huge confidence from what ive done in the past
1919525 ive always been in the race mentally ive never let myself down were up against some really tough crews its a huge challenge and its cut throat im ready for that
1919526 as far as personalities go nath and i get on really well but in the boat youve just got to make sure you do everything together on the flip side of that youve got the benefit of having another person involved and that enhances what you might get out of yourself personally
1919527 were really happy with where theyre at we think were getting close to what we want now
1919528 but i treat those results with caution i know theres two or three crews youre just not going to see till the last part of the olympic final thats how its always been they perform poorly in early regattas but always come up for the big ones
1919529 a loner who realizes the importance of being part of a group and helping for the common good

1919581 starvation takes the fun out of travel and from this point of view the orient express is more inadequate than the poorest madrasi train where you exchange stained lunch coupons for a tin tray of vegetables and a quart of rice the conversation like many others i had with people on trains derived an easy candour from the shared journey the comfort of the dining car and the certain knowledge that neither of us would see each other again

1919599 now i want you to know brothers that what has happened to me has actually resulted in the advancement of the gospel so that it has become know throughout the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that my imprisonment is for christ most of the brothers in the lord have gained confidence from my imprisonment and dare even more to speak the message fearlessly
1919600 some to be sure preach christ out of envy and strife but others out of good will these do so out of love knowing that i am appointed for the defense of the gospel the others proclaim christ out of rivalry not sincerely seeking to cause mw trouble in my imprisonment what does it matter just that in every way whether out of false motives or true christ is proclaimed and in this i rejoice
1919601 yes and i will rejoice because i know this will lead to my deliverance in through your prayers and help from the spirit of jesus christ my eager expectation and hope is that i will not be ashamed about anything but that now as always with all boldness christ will be highly honored in my body whether by life or death
1919602 for me living is christ and dying is gain now if i live on in the flesh this means fruitful work for me and i dont know which one i should choose i am pressured by both i have the desire to depart and be with christ which is far better but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for you
1919603 since i am persuaded of this i know that i will remain and continue with all of you for your advancement and joy in the faith so that because of me your confidence may grow in christ jesus when i come to see you again

1919614 john mccain a maverick the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008 the american people are learning that the john mccain of 2008 represents more of the same failed policies weve gotten from george bush for the past eight years senator mccain is clearly in the tank for exxon and big oil for keeping our troops stuck in iraq for decades to come and for an economic policy that puts tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations above relief for hardworking families john mccain has changed hes taken the low road leveling false negative and misleading attacks against barack obama john mccain is no more a maverick within the republican party than dick cheney is hes just more of the same
1919615 but stylistically and substantively there is no daylight between george bush and john mccain they are joined at the hip
1919616 john mccain has changed in profound and fundamental ways that i find personally really surprising and frankly upsetting he is not the john mccain as a senator who defined himself quote as a maverick though questionable this is a different john mccain
1919617 on iraq on the economy on tax policy on domestic policy across the board he is espousing the bush policies hes changed a lot since 2001
1919618 but in the end after eight devastating years under president bush senator mccain is simply offering four years more
1919619 you know the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt vote for this john mccain we dont need another four years of george bush what hes proposing is four more years of george bushs economic policy and its ridiculous and its unfair the american people

1919852 i just shave a small amount about once a week
1919853 i want to take care of people who havent had the opportunities ive had
1919854 i dont believe in being mean to anyone im a really peaceful person thats something i get from my family
1919855 im pretty much okay with myself i think the only thing is to just have fun
1919856 im addicted to nintendo i play sports games and adventure games and role playing like final fantasy 3 i cant always do what i want to do like play basketball because i cant go outside the hotel so when i play nintendo i enter a different world and relax
1919857 i kinda did my hair more sophisticated i kind of sick of that old blond parted down the middle kinda rubbish
1919858 we are a group and it wouldnt feel good if i got all the attention we get attention just because were a good team
1919859 i like to do anything i can think of to these guys
1919860 i dont have many friends i just have these guys
1919861 i want to be crazy forever even when im 80
1919862 i can be shy around girls the other guys have got far more experience
1919863 character is far more important than appearance i like a girl whos honest thats very important she has to have some grit in her be able to stand up for herself but most of all she has to love me of course
1919864 just me myself im a very ordinary down to earth kinda guy and i hope thats all my girl would need
1919865 faithfulness is very important to me i would be incapable of cheating on my girlfriend i couldnt look at her straight in the eye if i had a girlfriend i wouldnt even need to look at other girls
1919866 i know a lot of girls who are just friends the way i prefer it i dont really want to fall in love yet i prefer to wait a little bit to be honest ive never really fallen in love ive never felt this strong sensation im still very young and i have lots of time for love the day i find the girl of my dreams i would spoil her rotten
1919867 to do something romantic i would take her to the beach when the sun is going down the sky would be full of stars and apart from the sound of the sea it would be a very quiet and intimate moment
1919868 we like to have a close relationship with our fans i could go out with one of them but i dont think it could develop any further
1919869 its great to have people thinking about you people we meet are always cool with us were very lucky
1919870 we sometimes get underwear thrown on stage but theyre not very aerodynamic so they dont travel very far we mostly get cuddly toys with phone numbers
1919871 i trust my mom 100 she knows me very well and is capable of guessing my thoughts i love when shes there
1919872 being on my own with just the silence of the sea is such an escape from the constant screaming of fans on a backstreet boys tour its something i need to do just to get away from it all
1919873 when i come off stage i go straight back to the hotel i love to take a long shower and then go to sleep i never seem to take too much time to drop off after a show generally im always very tired and can sleep anywhere
1919874 live life to the fullest its too bad were not cats we only have one life
1919875 im so lucky this is something ive been wanting to do ever since i was really young and its something ive worked for a long time i think anybody can pursue their dreams no matter what they do they can achieve what they want to achieve
1919876 the traveling does kinda get gruesome sometimes im away from the rest of my family and i miss them
1919877 every day i get a lot of hugs from fans and the guys but i dont get a proper hug every day i wish i did
