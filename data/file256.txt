2560000 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2560001 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2560002 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2560003 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2560004 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2560005 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2560006 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2560007 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2560008 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2560009 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2560010 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2560011 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2560012 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2560013 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2560014 he was on a quest to meet me and he was like i think youre beautiful and i really like you
2560015 nick and i loved each other we still do but we were in love with each other for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
2560016 when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great
2560017 and then on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hardcore i was rebelling against everything nick wanted me to be
2560018 maybe hell be my best friend for the rest of my life or maybe ill end up marrying nick jonas
2560019 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2560020 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2560021 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2560022 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2560023 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2560024 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2560025 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2560026 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2560027 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2560028 its not about the terrorists its about us its about what kind of country we are
2560029 is to make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture whether it be here at home or abroad
2560030 the signing statement is saying i will only comply with this law when i want to and if something arises in the war on terrorism where i think its important to torture or engage in cruel inhuman and degrading conduct i have the authority to do so and nothing in this law is going to stop me
2560031 the cia should have the ability to use additional techniques
2560032 the practice of shipping away prisoners in the dead of night to be tortured in far off countries of detaining thousands without charge or trial of maintaining a network of secret prisons to jail people beyond the reach of the law
2560033 i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the republicans as a partisan witch hunt because i think weve got too many problems to solve
2560034 prosecution of any officials if it were to occur would probably not occur during obamas first term
2560035 instead we may well see a congressionally empowered commission that would seek testimony from witnesses in search of the truth about what occurred though some witnesses might be offered immunity in exchange for testimony the question of whether anybody would be prosecuted would be deferred to a later date meaning obamas second term if such is forthcoming
2560036 the commission would focus strictly on detention torture and extraordinary rendition or the practice of spiriting detainees to a third country for abusive interrogations the panel would focus strictly on these abuses leaving out any other allegedly illegal activities during the bush administration such as domestic spying
2560037 silk road to ruin is central asia the new middle east
2560038 we will remember this tragedy for the rest of our lives
2560039 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2560040 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2560041 we wont allow the death of our compatriots to go unpunished
2560042 give russia the message that invading the territory of a sovereign state and bombing its territory is unacceptable in the 21st century
2560043 the latest tragic developments should become the last step toward the recognition of south ossetias independence
2560044 i am sure that the independence of south ossetia will be recognized in the near future
2560045 its been a while and it was a good confidence booster for caroline and i
2560046 it was satisfying we took it one step at a time and it was funny we were talking afterwards and we were thinking the same sort of things coming down the track and we were very much in our own boat and focusing on one stroke at a time
2560047 it was good to put it together on the day but weve always been good trainers and weve done some good tests over the last couple of days but until you put it together on the day you cant claim it so it was a good race
2560048 its a bit of deja vu back to athens so it is going to be a long week
2560049 there is a good feeling in the camp but on their past records everyone has performed as they should but its a good day for the kiwi team for sure
2560050 well take a look at the race tonight and see where we can improve
2560051 the big thing was not to get rattled stay in our rhythm and be confident in our speed and know we could come through but we are aware what is coming up semifinals eight good crews six spots its all on it is what you come here for
2560052 i have deliberately and consciously written respectfully about islam and mohammed i envisioned that my book would be a bridge builder
2560053 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
2560054 in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
2560055 spent a number of years lobbying on behalf of georgia and has publicly taken strong pro georgia anti russia positions
2560056 has developed a very close relationship with president of georgia mikheil saakashvili and many senior georgian officials
2560057 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course
2560058 the us should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2560059 has involved russia with opening fire at russian citizens and peacekeepers now he is trying to involve other states and international organizations
2560060 the 1980 carter doctrine that the us was determined to dominate the persian gulf is at the root of the first gulf war of the present iraq war and of the possible war on iran brzezinskis grandiose schemes of world transformation caused a renewal of the cold war and gave birth to al qaeda and without soviet restraint the results could easily have been far more tragic than they turned out to be

2560063 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2560064 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2560065 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2560066 we are tying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2560067 i see all the nations get together i am very upset about it i wish everybody would be at peace especially during the olympics
2560068 if he is out of the picture weapons of mass destruction capability has been set back which would make this one of the more effective strikes in recent years
2560069 i believe that al qaida has no shortage of people adept with explosives and i know that al masri promulgated training manuals for poisons
2560070 but im not sure how skilled any of proteges may be at synthesizing chemical weapons or toxins
2560071 you need both education and hands on experience to produce decent quality chemical weapons or toxins
2560072 from the u s government perspective he was seen as a major threat his potential to develop primitive weapons of mass destruction was not taken lightly by u s law enforcement and intelligence agencies
2560073 the death of abu khabab al masri has a short term impact on operations by eliminating a competent senior leader
2560074 over the long run however al qaida has demonstrated an ability to replace most of its leaders that have been captured or killed

2560129 she is a person of note in our little community
2560130 long been a registered republican the only time i was going to vote democratic was for jfk if he had run in 1964
2560131 she was a fantastic dynamic speaker and reflects what barack is all about
2560132 ive never been involved in politics before and never donated money
2560133 hes the man for the job with the ideas hes got and our help hes going to be great
2560134 today is the day that we say welcome home to barack obama
2560135 i try to explain to them something about the aloha spirit i try to explain to them this basic idea that we all have obligations to each other that were not alone that if we see somebody whos in need we should help
2560136 most importantly that when you come from hawaii you start understanding that whats on the surface what people look like that doesnt determine who they are
2560137 and that the power and strength of diversity the ability of people from everywhere whether theyre black or white whether theyre japanese american or korean american or filipino american or whatever they are they are just americans that all of us can work together and all of us can join together to create a better country
2560138 its that spirit that im absolutely convinced is what america is looking for right now

2560143 it wasnt a political speech it was from the heart
2560144 when we first drove out here we were told we should organize the three democrats out here and make sure we get all three of them
2560145 but as weve come here weve noticed there are a lot of republicans who want permission to vote for obama and a lot of people who are very upset with the way the countrys going
2560146 the strength of this they know who they are they know what the local issues are they know the local things going on so they can speak to their fellow voters and also in a sense be almost character witnesses for sen obama and build support that way

2560151 this is not the first time for me performing in the olympics but in front of such a large cheering crowd we were very excited
2560152 of course we still have some pressure on our shoulders but because of the home crowd our motivation is strong
2560153 we are very happy with this victory because its not easy to win the first match of the olympic games
2560154 i think that we played a very good match because we played with good rhythm
2560155 im very proud of my players because theyve been able to play a very good match with a completely new formation its important to start the olympic games with an important victory
2560156 at the beginning our coordination was poor and then we improved and played better and better

2560166 just to make things clear we are not stating that anthropogenic climate change wont be as bad as previously thought

2560179 all the actuaries all the objective scorekeepers of the federal government are predicting this
2560180 they say we are 53 trillion short of fulfilling the promises the government is making to the american people in todays dollars
2560181 meaning that if we want to keep the promises of medicare medicaid and social security which are basically the three major entitlement programs today we would have to set aside 53 trillion dollars and invest them at treasury rates in order to do it
2560182 for the last 40 years the federal government has had to tax every dollar made in america at 18 3 cents on that dollar to pay the bills of the federal government
2560183 by the time my three children who are three five and six years old are my age the federal government will have to tax 40 cents out of every dollar made in america just to pay the bills for the federal government at that time
2560184 they said that the current low rate the 10 percent bracket for low income americans would have to go up to 25 percent
2560185 those would be the tax rates you would have to have if you wanted to tax your way out of this problem
2560186 and if you did that all experts conclude you would literally crash the american economy
2560187 the legacy of this country has always been that each generation confronts the challenges before it so that the next generation is better off
2560188 in the past we brought down the iron curtain and won the cold war
2560189 the problem that we have right now putting foreign policy aside and our fight with islamic radicalism is that we have an economic crisis we have a fiscal crisis and that is we will bankrupt this country and the best century in america will be the last century
2560190 unless we turn our fiscal situation around and pay off this debt and change the way these programs work to a more sustainable path the next generation will have inferior living standards

2560254 het viel me op dat je niet danste wacht je misschien nog op de juiste muziek
2560255 ach daar ligt het niet aan hoor maar jij danst geloof ik wel graag
2560256 ik amuseer me prima ja dat heb je scherp opgemerkt
2560257 tja ik heb wel oog voor detail je moet hier wel flexibel voor zijn niet
2560258 ach het scheelt ook met wie je danst maar de danspassen zijn vrij eenvoudig al helpt een goed ritmegevoel en soepele heupen ook wel enigszins
2560259 nee hoor je danst hier met iedereen maar dan moeten ze wel willen dansen natuurlijk
2560260 als je dat wilt maar wat brengt jou hier eigenlijk als het niet het dansen is

2560262 the history of tennis at the lakewood racquet club and the world
2560263 tennis has directly and indirectly caused the deaths of kings that changed a nation altered the role of women in sports and even in little ole lakewood provided insight for a microchip inventor
2560264 this is a view of history through the fuzz on the felt of the tennis ball
2560265 although never released feedback from atari engineers and people who tested the mindlink have commented that the time and effort put into the mindlink system was wasted because the controllers did not perform well and gave people headaches from over concentration and constantly moving their eyebrows around to control the onscreen activities

2560272 even though nikhil didnt quite have a great outing with salaam e ishq we must remember that he is the same man who made kal ho na ho with chandni chowk to china he has changed genre yet again and opted for an action comedy entertainer moreover akshays name is good enough to excite an audience
2560273 yes tashan was an exception but if one looks closely even akshay was guarded during the films promotion he is a smart man and probably knew which way the film was headed for thats the reason there wasnt much hue and cry even though he was the best part about the film also one must remember that yash raj films traditionally do not go for a publicity overdrive whereas vipul shah made sure that singh is kinng was the talk of the town akshay chipped in a big way as well to the films promotional plan and as everyone can see history has been made
2560274 it is as simple as that if you find akshay talking about the film through all avenues possible and genuinely promoting it in a big way be rest assured that he is excited about the film
2560275 akshay knows that he is a huge brand and there is a responsibility which comes with his spoken words audiences dote on him and he will never want to hurt them by talking big about a poor product in any case chandni chowk is a well made film and thats the very reason why trade is mighty excited about it
2560276 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2560277 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2560278 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2560279 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2560280 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2560281 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2560282 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2560283 we messed up we owned up to it we apologized now that thats behind us lets move on
2560284 all of us are now battling for a place in the team so no one can just expect to wear the shirt
2560285 weve a much larger squad and the boss can now change things if he sees fit
2560286 i was able to throw quality and pacy forwards like paul parry and jay bothroyd on against southampton late on which i couldnt do before
2560287 players like that can change games while ross mccormack who was already leading the line with steve thompson is also quick
2560288 i had four forwards on at the end which highlights the depth of this squad and that is very important for a manager as you need to have a few tricks up your sleeve
2560289 and hopefully i can get one or two more players in to add to the competition for places
2560290 i will wait until the end of the august transfer window if i have to or i might bring in another player on loan but competition for places is so vitally crucial if you want success
2560291 he deserved his start and after his goal the lads were delighted for him and when a striker scores it is hard to take them out of the team
2560292 we had a good bench today players that can change a game and thats what happened
2560293 a draw was a fair result southampton could feel very hard done by because we didnt play well
2560294 i am disappointed not to keep a clean sheet but the most important thing is taking three points
2560295 to me people normally react that way only because they have a certain problem themselves
2560296 a lady with the user name moonshadow on tv2blog did on 07 08 08 want to tell her friends how moderators might have answered to one of her many complaints
2560297 weve left it in place because we think the best way to deal with such people is to let them speak and condemn themselves
2560298 its always disappointing but its my first bad outing in a long time since the all star break
2560299 i felt like i made some good pitches and got out of the second inning i am not too upset about it you move on and i have already done that i am not going to look too much into it
2560300 we live in a market where people react they dont anticipate
2560301 so youve got this market thats kind on a seesaw every day reacting to news
2560302 look mommy hes fill in the blank with some distinguishing physical characteristic
2560303 we have introduced lots of options and our kids like a lot of them
2560304 they love organic cauliflower and i know i never ate cauliflower as a kid personally i live for the beginning of asparagus season
2560305 obesity and poverty have been linked to people eating more junk foods because they are less expensive think about eating less processed foods less white flours and white sugar
2560306 there is a reason cheap food is cheap stopping or diminishing purchases of non nutritive foods is a great way to cut down on costs
2560307 all natural meat is a nice mid price range the animals arent given growth hormones or antibiotics but the farmers also havent gone through the process of becoming certified organic
2560308 there are so many factors that go into how a food is made and its nutritional values you have to look at the soil it was grown in the weather conditions when it was picked relative to when it should be fully ripe
2560309 you have organic foods that are still being transported so to say that when you walk into a grocery store that an organic food is nutritionally superior we cant say that
2560310 we left los angeles on saturday and this is the third school weve hit
2560311 what were here doing is kind of a teaser for this campaign
2560312 were really excited about being on tv this year even some of our players cried we want to show people that sunshine has talent too
2560313 in actuality there were questions of what wed have to do while the crew was here
2560314 the team has some goals this was sort of one of their goals
2560315 the long shot goal was being on friday night blitz weve met that goal
2560316 i try to help athletes with basic skills relaxation handling anxiety imagery setting goals focusing concentration and positive thinking
2560317 the other end of it is helping athletes deal with stresses that are not related to the sport like breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend or a death in the family
2560318 when the mogul team needed someone they wanted a woman who is licensed as a psychologist who could also ski
2560319 what i work with them on is developing their own plan their own routine so they are not worried about what this competitor is doing or what the crowd is saying
2560320 they have their plan their routine and if they do everything that we talked about and stick to their plan the results will take care of themselves
2560321 the u s is seen negatively at times in taekwondo
2560322 the judging is very subjective and the athletes have to deal with it at times they think they should have scored are not credited and have to get perspective on that
2560323 she has made them mentally tougher and helps the team address any problems that come up
2560324 what got me into this field was watching how my mind affected my performance and trying to understand what techniques to use and then wanting to teach other people that
2560325 this has been my goal all along to work at the olympic level i feel very fortunate to be able to do that

2560360 machado me manifest agrega el testimonio que por orden de acosta y lara crosas cuevas iba a realizar algunos operativos especiales y por lo tanto deb a prestarle toda la colaboraci n que solicitara
2560361 la otra persona era un joven de barba a quien llamaban jos al que posteriormente reconoc como miguel sof a el cual seg n un comentario suscitado en el ministerio integra la jup juventud uruguaya de pie crosas lo nombr varias veces como su principal colaborador

2560368 no se lograr un proceso de paz ni en este ni en los pr ximos a os israel respaldado por estados unidos no pretende cumplir con las exigencias b sicas del pueblo palestino la creaci n de un estado independiente y por lo tanto recurrimos a las actividades militares para presionar a la ocupaci n y lograr nuestro objetivo utilizando un m todo alternativo
2560369 condenamos firmemente esta decisi n del ministerio de defensa de permitir nuevos asentamientos en cisjordania en el valle jord n no es del inter s del pueblo israel ni del p blico israel tener nuevos asentamientos mientras tenemos negociaciones con palestinos acerca de tener dos estados
2560370 termin con las negociaciones de an polis ayer cuando declar que no hab a ninguna posibilidad de llegar a un acuerdo antes de fin de a o destruy las negociaciones de an polis al declarar que jerusal n no es parte de la discusi n y hoy probablemente proporcion las municiones para aniquilar por completo el proceso de an polis olmert est retir ndose en medio de fracasos pero su mayor fracaso es que ha demostrado que hasta el momento no hay ning n socio para la paz en israel
2560371 la misi n consiste en entrar a gaza sin pasar por el territorio de israel o de egipto navegando desde las aguas internacionales directamente hasta gaza esto no se ha hecho desde 1967 y hay motivos para pensar que nadie va a interferir en esto porque israel dijo que ya no est ocupando gaza as que queremos ponerlo a prueba

2560373 se plantearon docenas de ideas acerca de c mo provocar la guerra la que me interes m s fue por qu no construimos nosotros en nuestro astillero cuatro o cinco botes que se parezcan a los botes pt iran es colocarles sellos de la armada con muchas armas y la pr xima vez que uno de los botes ingrese en el estrecho de hormuz comenzar un tiroteo podr a costar algunas vidas y fue rechazado porque no se puede hacer que estadounidenses maten estadounidenses ese es el nivel de cosas del que estamos hablando provocaci n pero eso fue rechazado
2560374 los centros de fusi n son parte de una tendencia mucho m s amplia aqu una tendencia del movimiento de nuestras naciones hacia la sociedad de vigilancia donde nuestros movimientos y cada transacci n que hagamos es vigilada y examinada en busca de indicios de comportamiento sospechoso y ese tipo de visi n de c mo hacer cumplir la ley c mo detener el terrorismo se transforma en una justificaci n de llevar un registro de todos nosotros en nuestras vidas cotidianas
2560375 no me sorprender a que haya visto algunas encuestas en las que hayamos ca do un poco como consecuencia del viaje hemos estado fuera del pa s durante una semana a las personas les preocupa el precio de la gasolina les preocupan las ejecuciones hipotecarias el motivo por el que cre que este viaje era importante es porque estoy convencido de que muchos de los problemas que afrontamos en nuestro pa s no ser n resueltos tan eficazmente a menos que tengamos socios fuertes en el extranjero

2560379 gracias a dios no se lleg a ning n acuerdo porque la propuesta que se estaba manejando hubiera exacerbado los graves problemas econ micos sociales y de seguridad alimentaria que ahora afectan seriamente a muchos pa ses

2560386 han resaltado en todos los mbitos la necesidad de concretar un proceso que asegure la participaci n de todos los actores involucrados y hemos advertido que de no hacerlo corren el riesgo de recibir impugnaciones legales al ordenamiento que aprueben lo cual redundar en largas demoras paralizando toda la actividad en el territorio provincial

2560415 less than five hours after the first reports of trouble he imposed a round the clock curfew on the entire city taverns and filling stations were closed bus service and mail delivery were suspended streets were barred to all but emergency traffic as milwaukees suburbs followed suit an eerie silence settled over the entire metropolitan area
2560416 did maier overreact by shutting down the entire metropolis rather than the neighborhoods most directly affected the mayor magnified the impact of the disturbance kept from work kept from play kept from even their neighborhood taverns many city and suburban residents developed a siege mentality fed by nonstop rumors revolution seemed imminent and worried whites hauled any number of deer rifles and target pistols out of storage just in case crazed blacks decided to attack communities miles from the core

2560419 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2560420 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2560421 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2560422 persiapan event ini memakan waktu hampir dua bulan termasuk mendesain sirkuit agar berstandar internasional
2560423 bisa dibilang ini sirkuit terbaik yang pernah saya lihat di indonesia dalam 15 tahun terakhir
2560424 dibanding sirkuit supercross seri pertama di bekasi dan seri kedua di yogyakarta sirkuit di jember jauh lebih menantang dan tingkat kesulitannya juga lumayan tinggi
2560425 kami berharap daerah lain bisa melakukan hal serupa semakin banyak daerah yang bersedia menggelar event seperti ini olahraga motorcross atau supercross di tanah air akan makin berkembang

2560428 if pdf spam email messages have all but disappeared there can only be one reason theyre not working
2560429 spammers wouldnt turn away from pdf spam if it was an effective way to fill their pockets with cash and direct consumers to their websites dodgy goods or dodgy investment opportunities this drop indicates that the spammers are finding it hard to fool the public into reading marketing messages distributed in this way
2560430 of course its too early to say that this is the last we will see of pdf spam there could still be more campaigns to come but its dramatic fall may be a sign that we are witnessing its demise
2560431 our advice remains the same to all internet users it make sense to ensure that your email inbox is properly defended with a product which can defend against the threats of spam and malware
2560432 pdf spam simply isnt as immediate a way of communicating with your intended audience as an instant glimpse of the marketing message in your victims email preview pane
2560433 furthermore have you tried opening a pdf file adobe acrobat chugs into action taking a fair while to load before it can show you the contents of the pdf consumers learn pretty quickly that its a waste of time to open every unsolicited pdf they receive which means the spammers message doesnt get read and the cybercriminals dont make any money
2560434 in the last month image based spam 2 attacks including pdf and excel spam accounted for over 50 of all spam we detected
2560435 excel spam on its own currently accounts for just 5 but this still represents millions of messages and next month we may start to see powerpoint or word files for example rpd technology is the only way to protect against this growing trend and stay one step ahead of the spammers
2560436 you know heron you gotta be subtle to stand out these days
2560437 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2560438 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2560439 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2560440 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2560441 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2560443 nazi propaganda or some other usage of the word that applies it only in its negative sense
2560444 oh well we only gave in because china was moving in
2560445 but taken at face value it would be hard to find fault with president sirleaf which is why the film could be called propaganda its not balanced
2560446 there are probably men out there who might not take sirleaf seriously or might think that there is no way she could know what she is doing this film pretty much throws that in their faces
2560447 i viewed the president of liberia as an honest straight forward person not one of those politicians that dance around questions or issues because they are afraid that some people might get offended

2560455 i believe that al qaida has no shortage of people adept with explosives and i know that al masri promulgated training manuals for poisons
2560456 but im not sure how skilled any of proteges may be at synthesizing chemical weapons or toxins
2560457 you need both education and hands on experience to produce decent quality chemical weapons or toxins
2560458 from the u s government perspective he was seen as a major threat his potential to develop primitive weapons of mass destruction was not taken lightly by u s law enforcement and intelligence agencies
2560459 the death of abu khabab al masri has a short term impact on operations by eliminating a competent senior leader
2560460 over the long run however al qaida has demonstrated an ability to replace most of its leaders that have been captured or killed

2560471 he presented as being sexualized well beyond his years and gave a recitation of the events surrounding his abuse which was chilling in its routine use of sexual words and phrases
2560472 i have no hesitation in concluding that the sexual degradation of the child by the accused has had a very detrimental effect
2560473 this case presents itself as a portrait of the devastating consequences of child sexual abuse
2560474 so illogical and preposterous as to lead to the conclusion it was concocted in an effort to explain away very damning evidence

2560514 mary houghtaling who runs a hospice in wilmington ohio choked up as she told mccain of dhls plans to close its domestic air hub in her town a move that could throw 8 600 people out of work
2560515 mccain and his campaign manager rick davis played roles in the fate of dhl express and its ohio air park as far back as 2003
2560516 those jobs are on the chopping block because sen mccain and his campaign were involved in a deal that resulted in control of those positions being shifted to a foreign corporation
2560517 the firm of rick davis john mccains campaign manager earned 185 000 lobbying for foreign ownership and 405 000 after the deal passed congress
2560518 i dont know if i can stop it thats some straight talk some more straight talk i doubt it
2560519 under the terms of the deal deutsche post will buy only airbornes ground operations its airline unit will be spun off as a stand alone business deutsche post will then draw up a contract with this new airline to handle business in america this not only satisfies the ownership rules maintains uwe doerken dhls chief executive but also fits with dhls broader strategy of contracting out its airline work combined he says the new operation would have 21 of the overnight delivery market inside america and 23 of the market in deliveries into and out of the country in the ground delivery business where ups has 70 of the market dhl would have just a 2 share but it says that weak competition and fat margins make it an easier business to enter the airborne arrangements ought to satisfy one of the worries raised by kenneth mead the dots inspector general about dhl airways deutsche post sold a controlling stake in its airline to william robinson an american citizen who had been a big shareholder in dhls international operations mr robinson installed his attorney his brother and his financial adviser on the four man board further satisfying the letter of the law but mr mead seems to be worried that dhl and mr robinson have entered into arrangements formal or informal that cede actual control of the airline to the germans the airborne deal seems to be free of such complicating personal relationships mr meads second worry is more pertinent this is that the contract between dhl and dhl airways gives the germans effective control by making dhl airways a captive vendor mr mead notes that 90 of dhl airways business is with dhl a figure that he says appears not to have changed since the dot got dhl airways to hire a marketing executive to drum up more outside business mr mead also notes that dhl guarantees dhl airways debts and picks up its operating costs the sort of contract that it will want to have with airbornes spun off airline fedex and ups both support mr meads recommendation that the dot put its decision on dhl airways to a judicial review by independent government lawyers
2560520 deutsche post is not a fair competitor it is a government owned monopoly it derives the vast majority of its profits from german mail delivery services that are shielded from competition and it has been repeatedly found guilty of unfair competitive practices and illegal subsidies

2560527 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
2560528 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
2560529 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
2560530 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

2560565 on a daily basis the conduct of the candidate is the one that decides its continuity

2560569 is she real or like columbos wife who he just refers to as a way getting information and disarming his suspects
2560570 were they for instance black or white young or old tall or short
2560571 they were scared particularly the first guy who was very very skinny in baggy jeans sagging really hes the one who claimed he had a gun and frankly i didnt believe he actually had a gun if you want to know the truth
2560572 yeah he was dressed in very dark clothes it was all very dark i guess he got me right as i came around the bend in the shadows there
2560573 yes my assailants were both black men fairly young wearing hoods though it happened fast of course and i dont think i could recognize them say if you showed me a team roster
2560574 i have to fill out this paperwork you wait inside we might want you to identity a suspect
2560575 has very much to do with how we think of ourselves how we behave how we think about our behavior the idea is that freedom has to do with making choices it has to do with deciding how you are going to live your life freedom also has to do with taking consequences once you have made your choice you cant say i didnt anticipate that i dont take responsibility for that having chosen you are then responsible for what follows as well
2560576 realizing what your particular talents and virtues are falling in love with yourself in a very important way and understanding what your life is about manifesting those virtues manifesting those talents passionately throwing yourself into the work you do and as he put it borrowing from the ancient greeks becoming the person that you really are

2560581 dying and rising messiah appears in some jewish texts but until now everyone thought that was the impact of christianity on judaism
2560582 but for the first time we have proof that it was the other way around the concept was there before jesus
2560583 this should shake our basic view of christianity what happens in the new testament could have been adopted by jesus and his followers based on an earlier messiah story
2560584 it is certainly not perfectly clear that the tablet is talking about a crucified and risen savior figure called simon
2560585 witherington also points out that gospel texts are far less reliant on the observed fact of the resurrection there is no angelic command in them like the line in the gabriel stone than on the testimony of eyewitnesses to jesus post resurrection self
2560586 but it is similar to to other texts found around the dead sea
2560587 to be honest it just seems like one of those great opportunities where the target is there and shame on us if we dont go after it

2560612 some 15 years ago i began publishing a little community newspaper in a small upstate new york town
2560613 i should say that reports of the death of print journalism are greatly exaggerated
2560614 when big media cassandras come to our conventions and prognosticate about the future of journalism being interactive and hyper local we just grin at them because thats what weve been doing all along
2560615 its a noble calling and it can make a huge difference in the civic life of the community
2560616 it takes a long time to develop a successful and profitable newspaper and i would say three quarters of the work has been done here
2560617 unfortunately we cannot continue to subsidize a commercial radio station
2560618 we take seriously and respect the role we have played in maintaining a community radio station as stewards of a broadcasting license board chairman wallace w
2560619 whatever the configuration of wbtns ownership in the future we would hope that it would maintain its commitment to true community programming as well as affording our communications students and members of the community the opportunity to produce local broadcast content as it does now an ideal outcome might be for a local group to take over this local media resource with whom we could partner

2560631 theres no question there has been some negative impact as a result of the problems arising from the subprime residential market downturn
2560632 that said while the volume of investment levels has slowed the gloom and doom scenarios predicted for the commercial real estate market have yet to materialize and the underlying fundamentals continue to be fairly strong
2560633 they have noticed that the tightening of the credit markets has had a broader impact on the economy as a whole most apparently in the residential sector but gradually moving over to the commercial side as well as a result highly leveraged investors are finding it harder to make deals compared to all cash and low leveraged buyers because they need to come up with a higher proportion of equity that in turn is extending the amount of time it takes to do deals
2560634 dire warnings that appeared in the newspapers and nightly newscasts where concerns were expressed about how far the problems in the credit markets would extend and whether or not the sky was falling
2560635 on the bright side is the recent decline in the federal fund rate as well as continued job growth in the service producing employment sector plus 60 000 in august
2560636 so while doom and gloom scenarios may make eye catching headlines those kinds of predictions are probably premature based on the limited data we have right now

2560706 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
2560707 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
2560708 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
2560709 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
2560710 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do

2560744 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2560745 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2560746 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2560747 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2560748 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2560749 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2560750 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2560751 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2560759 this killing of israeli atheletes is an act of war and if its one place war doesnt belong its here for 1200 years from 776 b c to 393 a d your fellow olympians laid down their arms to take part in these games they understood that there was more honour in out running a man than killing him i hope the competition will resume and if it does you must not think that running or throwing or jumping is frivolous citius altius fortius it means faster higher stronger its been the motto for the olympics for the last 2500 years but it doesnt mean faster higher stronger than who youre competing against it just means faster higher stronger the games were once your fellow olympians answer to war competition not conquest now they must be your answer
2560760 well i cant say anything about other people i can only speak for myself the illusion of free will is so strong in my mind that i cant get away from it but i believe it is only an illusion but it is an illusion which is one of the strongest motives of my actions before i do anything i feel that i have choice and that influences what i do but afterwards when the thing is done i believe that it was inevitable from all eternity
2560761 why merely the futility of regret its no good crying over spilt milk because all the forces of the universe were bent on spilling it
2560762 drinking removes warts and pimples not from me but from those i look at
2560763 several months ago i proposed we take our reserve fund and pay off the bond fund for the water treatment plant upgrade which would have resulted in a savings of over 1 2 million dollars in interest payments
2560764 since then the city was offered a once in a lifetime opportunity to get rid of a very undesirable business in lavonia the transaction has now been finalized and we can make history for our city by purchasing the cafe risque property the city can now rid itself of that terrible business and the awful i 85 billboard blight
2560765 i remember when jerry sullivan walked into my shop and started telling me about the restaurant he intended to open
2560766 then several months ago we heard the owners were trying to sell it
2560767 we knew they would never sell it to us but a third party who does not want to be identified offered to buy it for us just before noon today tuesday we closed on the property the keys were over to us they former cafe risque owners wont find out until tomorrow who really bought it
2560768 we want to put some type of high quality eatery up there to go along with the type of businesses we want at that interchange

2560772 this is probably the toughest course ive ever played the rough is high and even if youre a good driver youre going to miss four fairways and the greens are tricky youre always putting up slopes
2560773 but somebodys going to enjoy it by the end of the week
2560774 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do

2560776 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2560777 one minute youre in a quarterback battle and the next minute its completely different there are two ways to look at this you can get down about it or turn it into a positive i get to pick the brain of a future hall of famer that chance doesnt come along too often
2560778 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city

2560817 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2560818 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2560819 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2560820 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2560821 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2560822 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2560823 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2560824 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2560825 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2560826 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men
2560827 if anyone asks a man that he will slap you

2560830 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2560831 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them our thoughts prayers and deepest condolences are with the bachman and mccutcheon families
2560832 when i arrived to work at noon nothing had happened
2560833 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2560834 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2560835 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2560836 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2560837 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2560838 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2560839 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2560840 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this

2560843 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2560844 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2560845 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2560846 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo

2560884 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2560885 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2560886 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2560887 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2560888 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2560889 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2560890 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2560895 dulu aku juga punya gambaran kalo penyiar radio itu gampang tapi setelah aku jalani aku mesti mengikuti pelatihan dulu sebelum resmi jadi penyiar
2560896 enaknya di radio kita bisa enjoy memberikan informasi sambil mendengarkan musik
2560897 berawal dari hobi dan punya waktu luang karena aku kerja di tempat lain masuknya siang jadi pagi bisa siaran dulu
2560898 aku merasa persaingan ketat antar sesama penyiar ketika memperebutkan posisi mc ini suka dibanding bandingkan kemampuannya jadi ya kita mesti banyak belajar lagi untuk membuktikan kalo kita memang bagus
2560899 nggak ah kami biasa aja nggak ada yang wah cuma kan tergantung orangnya mungkin karena berhubungan dengan dunia hiburan jadi terkesan glamour

2560913 today i cant believe it i cant believe im here
2560914 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock
2560915 this is probably the toughest course ive ever played the rough is high and even if youre a good driver youre going to miss four fairways and the greens are tricky youre always putting up slopes

2561095 the death of abu khabab al masri has a short term impact on operations by eliminating a competent senior leader

2561146 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use
2561147 i expect the kinds of uses will expand in the future but its still early in the game
2561148 if you lose a peregrine or prairie falcon that is native to north america its not as big an issue as losing something thats not native

2561177 indeed the young soul rebel spirit of the singles alarm clock and motorcycle is evident on the album but the record also takes in a range of less expected but no less profound influences the gorgeous harmonies are born out of the bands love of 1950s doo wop whilst the epic nature of charlies song writing recalls the oddball genius of both adam ant and queen as imagined by the stax house band
2561178 though youll notice some subtle prog flourishes and acoustic strums brown submarine is a pop punk album made by and for kids whove worn out the grooves on their cheap trick alice cooper wire and dbs records
2561179 mr pollard was so enthusiastic about this album that hes decided to play his first proper club tour in two years this from a guy who hates flying goes bananas sitting in the van and who has turned down tours with radiohead and the strokes give brown submarine a spin or two itll make you feel like a kid again too

2561189 england looked vibrant and i do think our guys werent mentally in the same space as they were at the start of the series and thats understandable but its even stevens now with another one or two partnerships we can get up to or over 200 220 and put a lot of pressure on the england top five we feel we can defend that
2561190 hes improved over the last 12 months before he came here and what wed seen of him from when we did our homework hes become a much tighter player than last time he played against england
2561191 he got a beautiful ball from steve harmison to get rid of him in the first innings but what hes done so well is hes latched onto anything slightly loose and put it away for four he hits down the ground now as well as square so hes a pretty accomplished player
2561192 he obviously had a problem when he started but when i came in as coach he was always the one we identified to bat at 3 for us
2561193 we needed to give him a run and an opportunity
2561194 when we look back to where the planning started for a tour like this two years ago we needed hash to come into the tour with 20 tests under his belt hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him and hes going to be a quality player
2561195 hes so calm hes got a good head and hes pretty streetwise for a player his age
2561196 i wish that those involved would refrain from bad mouthing my sister
2561197 we initially boycotted the delegation as mehbooba mufti farooq abdullah and saifuddin soz were part of the team

2561280 my amendment is designed to empower tribal governments by giving them the necessary resources to maintain stronger police forces expand detention facilities improve tribal court systems and improve the ability of federal authorities to prosecute crime in indian country
2561281 we are seeing crime levels on some indian reservations reach epidemic proportions
2561282 life and safety of officers and inmates are at risk for lack of adequate justice facilities and programs
2561283 confirms what so many in indian country have known all along the tribal jail system is unbelievably broken
2561284 we have seen criminals setting up in indian country to try to operate without consequences putting children and communities everywhere at risk
2561285 this bill serves not only the treaty and trust obligations we owe to indian people but also our moral obligation to protect the public safety and ensure safe and secure communities for all americans
2561286 it is also an indication of broader failed policy in a lot of areas certainly in criminal statistics education opportunities achievement health care delivery life expectancy and disease rates it really should be unacceptable in our time for a child born in sioux falls to have one set of expectations and a child born on a reservation to have really no expectation for health life expectancy and achievement

2561290 lafevers the companys president said last week in an interview at his trackside office in americus
2561291 the products we had they didnt want the big guys got out of the cheap stuff
2561292 five dollar a gallon diesel fuel provides a powerful incentive to ship by rail
2561293 trucks are bogged down in traffic congestion particularly in areas like atlanta so that more and more of that freight is moving from the highway to the railroads
2561294 the surcharge money they derive which is a pretty significant part of their profits comes from unrestrained monopolistic power

2561322 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
2561323 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

2561327 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2561328 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2561329 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2561330 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2561331 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2561332 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
2561333 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
2561334 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
2561335 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2561336 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

2561348 bring then a sura like unto it and call to your aid anyone you can besides allah if it be ye speak the truth
2561349 but whats really significant here is the cone of silence the nations major newspapers including the times and the cable and broadcast networks dropped over this story when it first appeared in the tabloid during the presidential primary campaign next the enquirer reported that the unmarried hunter was pregnant still no mainstream media interest indeed never in recent journalistic history have so many tough reporters so closely resembled sheep as those members of the campaign press corps who meekly accepted edwards categorical dismissal of the enquirers allegations
2561350 edwards political appeal was rooted in his ability to turn a policy matter into a moral issue and to rouse his audience into action thats all gone now
2561351 barack obama and the msm especially the nyt will suffer significant collateral damage from the edwards fallout a big democrat one of obamas peers as candidate for president is a phony how big a phony remains to be seen but the signs do not favor a quick and clean resolution of the matter the archetype of the phony populist master manipulator of suckers gets recharged big time
2561352 so lets get this straight john edwards has an affair with a staff member and lies about it to the american public he gets caught by the national enquirer photographed e ven and still lies about it he says he never loved hunter and that the affair happened while his wifes cancer was in remission he says he couldnt be the father because of the timing of the babys birth and denies giving money to her to keep her quiet two former staff and good friends of edwards take the fall baron says he paid off hunter and andrew young says hes the actual father of the baby something is a little fishy here
2561353 oh wait theres more edwards denied paying any money to hunter to keep her from going public but said it was possible some of his friends or supporters may have made payments without telling him he said he would ask questions about any possible arrangement ok there so i guess we are supposed to now believe that edwards had an affair with hunter that somehow ended then after the affair with edwards ended hunter had another affair with edwards married aide andrew young and managed to get pregnant by young
2561354 now lets apply these criteria to the rumors about john mccain and vicki iseman
2561355 political wives who stood by their men in the face of rumored or alleged marital infidelity

2561368 this space which is embraced by 13 arches representing canadas 10 provinces and three territories we also hope will be symbolic of the gateway between canada and china
2561369 it is cultural gateway it is a trading gateway it is an olympic gateway which says we are friends and we can build a better future together
2561370 this exhibition has already increased our knowledge about the vancouver winter olympic games and also brings the two cities closer to each other

2561396 the diesel engine can be fed with vegetable oils and would help considerably in the development of agriculture of the countries which use it the use of vegetable oils for engine fuels may seem insignificant today but such oils may become in course of time as important as petroleum and the coal tar products of the present time
2561397 we started off slowly the ground was heavy and there was no pressure for the first 20 minutes the pressure then started to build which paid dividends for us
2561398 we had a great youthful team out there which leaves me with hope i wanted to look at new combinations and everyone was enthusiastic

2561401 we have a contract with sonny bill williams that has been registered with the french rugby federation like any other contract with any other player
2561402 and it allows him to play in french territory for certain players we have to get a release letter to allow them to play with sonny bill there is no release letter needed
2561403 he has signed a contract he has played a game and he is with us
2561404 france doesnt have the same culture as australia does because getting arrested for that there are worse things than that in the world
2561405 he is in the middle of learning the differences between rugby union and rugby league

2561409 it may have delayed her eventual demise probably slow the cancer down but eventually she would have succumbed to this vicious cancer
2561410 the point here is that the primary tumor was treated
2561411 the bottom line is it probably does happen obviously it happens very rarely because it is the nature of cancer to grow not to regress
2561412 for the true believer or faithful this is a miracle for the true skeptic this is a random or very unusual coincidence for the doctor and scientist we call it complete spontaneous regression of cancer
2561413 im not the praying type but i just wanted to say thank you

2561422 it is the recommendation of this reviewer that the denial of coverage issued by regence bluecross blueshield of oregon for the glucose monitoring system is overturned
2561423 even though cgms in general is not considered the standard of care in evaluating this specific case cgms would be considered the standard of care by the medical community it would not be considered experimental because greater control of her glucose would result in improved health outcomes compared to standard therapy the greatest potential for the cgms with this enrollee is to monitor trend of variations in glucose rather than simply the highs and lows in blood sugar cgms can provide the trend of glucose excursion this patient is prone to hypoglycemia unawareness this feature in the paradigm real time system could be valuable for her to identify hypoglycemia trend thus allowing her to make an adjustment before a hypoglycemia event actually happens in addition there is an alert system in the machine that will alert the patient of hypoglycemia the sensors features on the paradigm insulin pump will likely improve her glucose control hba1c and safety

2561661 the suspension will cost smith more than 205 000 a fraction of his base salary fox also seemed to issue a stern warning toward smith and his future actions

2561701 sometimes i wanna die and come back as one of your tears
2561702 if we are silent khartoums account of the situation is the only one being heard and this is especially dangerous as the regime is again pushing its agenda of forcibly returning displaced persons from the camps that offer tenuous shelter and succor to highly insecure rural areas

2561706 chad sudan sowing the seeds of darfur ethnic targeting in chad by janjawid militias from sudan
2561707 sudanese justice minister abdul basit sabdarat said on tuesday august 5 2008 that he had appointed a prosecutor to examine alleged crimes in the war torn western region of darfur and to present cases to courts i have signed a decision to name a prosecutor for crimes in darfur from 2003 until now sabdarat told reporters at his ministry
2561708 the khartoum regime has over the years perfected internal and external mobilization techniques that have served it well whenever it faced serious threats to its hold on power one tactic is to persuade the public that the threat is in fact aimed at core national values and strategic interests rather than only the national congress partys national islamic fronts partisan interests the state controlled mass media and friday prayer sermons were used to send that message the ncp staged demonstrations objecting to the prosecutors request for an arrest warrant charging bashir with genocide
2561709 international aid workers are expressing concern over what some describe as the worsening security situation in eastern chad aid workers say as the number of car thefts and armed assaults has increased so has the fear of banditry in a complex region filled with rebel factions refugees and vulnerable communities
2561710 field workers from international humanitarian organizations have expressed renewed worries over their personal security in eastern chad in light of what some call a severely deteriorating security environment for the international agencies that provide aid to hundreds of thousands of chadians and refugees from neighboring sudan
2561711 oxfam international which supplies water and food to over 120 000 people in eastern chad has been forced to pull out of one area because of attacks on its workers says spokeswoman judith enriquez ferrano weve seen through 2007 and 2008 a real increase in the insecurity in chad slowly its not a drastic change but slowly it becomes more violent and more difficult to work three or four years ago there wasnt this type of problem in chad you could move quite easily wherever you wanted and quite freely now its not the case anymore she said
2561712 oxfam pulled its workers out of the town of kerfi in southeastern chad last week along with paris based doctors without borders after the compounds of each of the organizations were attacked by armed local residents oxfam said in a press release the attackers had tried to burn down the workers house with the workers still inside
2561713 last july 2007 i went to chad to look into how the international criminal court which has a field office in abeche and works with refugees in the camps is performing on the ground as part of my assessment i interviewed dozens of refugees considering the hardships the refugees faced daily i was not sure how they would feel talking about a topic as abstract as accountability in an international forum thus i was surprised when their reactions to my questions were positive with even a hint of impatience because the icc prosecutor had not yet gone after the president of sudan omar hassan ahmed bashir icc prosecutor moreno ocampos actions will no doubt be greeted with joy in the camps for displaced persons
2561714 as one darfur refugee put it to me there is no justice in sudan
2561715 yet some commentators outside darfur have argued that this moment of jubilation can only be a symbolic victory for the long suffering people of that region they contend that should the prosecution of top officials however terrible their crimes go forward it will interfere with prospects for peace and security sudans history makes a strong case for the opposite conclusion the persistent lack of accountability has instead undermined the prospects for peace and stability there has been little peace to keep
2561716 we have said that the humanitarian situation is precarious many times but this time its really serious
2561717 the massive majority of attacks occur in the main towns and state capitals where the khartoum regime has absolute control it is simply not in their interest to improve security
2561718 the aid group doctors without borders said friday it has pulled staff out of two locations in sudans war torn darfur region which the united nations said will leave 65 000 people without medical aid the group said in a statement it had been forced to evacuate its staff from the tawila and shangil tobaya areas of north darfur after a series of violent attacks against them
2561719 the sudanese government have a responsibility to ensure security throughout their territory john holmes under secretary general for humanitarian affairs said in a statement
2561720 in an attack on february 27 2004 in the tawilah area of northern darfur 30 villages were burned to the ground over 200 people killed and over 200 girls and women raped some by up to 14 assailants and in front of their fathers who were later killed a further 150 women and 200 children were abducted
2561721 during the month of july bureaucratic impediments and insecurity continued to hamper relief efforts and humanitarian access throughout darfur humanitarian agencies report regularly changing administrative procedures the non issuance of visas to humanitarian workers and government refusal to allow humanitarian agencies to use rented vehicles
2561722 the large majority of attacks on humanitarians occur in main towns and state capitals where the government of sudan has absolute control its not in their interest to improve security
2561723 sudanese authorities have expelled the head of the dutch branch of the charity medecins sans frontieres msf from the war stricken region of darfur a humanitarian source said on wednesday banu altanbas who heads operations in nyala south darfur was ordered to leave darfur immediately by sudans humanitarian affairs commission hac on sunday the source told afp asking to remain anonymous
2561724 altanbas who was declared persona non grata in darfur by the sudanese authorities left the vast western region of darfur but she has stayed on in sudan the source said
2561725 i t is the first time such measures are taken against msf which won the nobel peace prize in 1999 in darfur where five of its branches from belgium spain france holland and switzerland operate
2561726 after a report by msf holland in 2005 that highlighted incidents of rape in darfurs refugee camps angry sudanese authorities briefly detained its head in sudan paul foreman accusing him of crimes against the sudanese state it is obvious that since then msf holland is being watched the matter is very serious said the head of a european ngo
2561727 other ngos have been targeted by expulsions since the 2003 outbreak of the darfur conflict including the us agency care in 2007 the norwegian refugee council in 2006 and britains oxfam and save the children in 2004 two members of the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs unocha were also expelled in 2007
2561728 last week an official with hac urged international ngos not to collaborate with the un office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs accusing the un agency of interfering in sudans domestic political affairs
2561729 the poverty is beyond description the fear is physically palpable when you move there the suffering of the population has gone on for so long now that if we have an escalation with this very small margin of survival for people in darfur that we may have the risk of a catastrophic development
2561730 five years into the armed conflict in sudans darfur region women and girls living in displaced persons camps towns and rural areas remain extremely vulnerable to sexual violence sexual violence continues to occur throughout the region both in the context of continuing attacks on civilians and during periods of relative calm those responsible are usually men from the sudanese security forces militias i e janjaweed rebel groups and former rebel groups who target women and girls predominantly but not exclusively from fur zaghawa masalit berti tunjur and other non arab ethnicities
2561731 survivors of sexual violence in darfur have no meaningful access to redress they fear the consequences of reporting their cases to the authorities and lack the resources needed to prosecute their attackers police are physically present only in principal towns and government outposts and they lack the basic tools and political will for responding to sexual violence crimes and conducting investigations
2561732 five years on no justice for sexual violence in darfur
2561733 one eyewitness reported that she witnessed four girls being escorted to an abandoned hut and raped at gunpoint by a group of soldiers belonging to the saf
2561734 information gathered by unamid human rights officers indicates that these actions by khartoums regular armed forces and its arab militia allies violated the principle of distinction stated in international humanitarian law failing to distinguish between civilian objects and military objectives
2561735 the scale of destruction of civilian property including objects indispensable for the survival of the civilian population suggests that the damage was a deliberate and integral part of a military strategy
2561736 six people have been killed and 28 wounded after men on camels attacked a civilian convoy in the sudanese region of darfur the un has said the convoy was traveling between nyala and fasher in northern darfur according to unamid a joint un african union peacekeeping mission it said the attackers were suspected members of the janjaweed militia
2561737 un officials said friday july 27 2008 that sudan government planes had bombed darfur this week despite a highly publicised peace pledge from sudanese president omar al beshir during a visit to the darfur region
2561738 a decline in the frequency of convoys and government escorts particularly with the re deployment of the police force during president al bashirs visit to the region further worsened the turnaround time for trucks delivering wfp food to darfur
2561739 coalition of more than 50 africa based and africa focused ngos dedicated to working together to promote a just peaceful and sustainable end to the ongoing humanitarian and human rights crisis in darfur
2561740 putting people first the protection challenge facing unamid in darfur
2561741 conducted by darfur consortium partners through interviews carried out in 2008 with internally displaced and or conflict affected darfur civilians humanitarian workers based in darfur and un au personnel based in darfur khartoum and new york
2561742 various bodies shoulder the responsibility for the shortcomings of unamid the government of sudan has effectively stalled deployment and the united nations security council and the african union peace and security council have allowed it to do so while supporting the mission with the voice and votes at the un major donor countries have not fulfilled their pledges to support the mission
2561743 despite the unanimous security council agreement on the need for unamid the force still lacks resources and capacity to operate at full strength i e more than 26 000 troops and civilian police to date it has just over 9 479 uniformed personnel most of who are ex amis forces i e part of the antecedent african union mission in sudan darfur the government of sudan continues to delay agreement with troop and police contributing countries and since january 2008 only 600 troops have been added to the ex amis forces
2561744 approximately 70 per cent of the police donated to unamid are assigned to local community policing centres in the idp camps but there is a shortage of international police and formed police units fpus which are armed and have greater powers to arrest perpetrators thus leaving the mission overstretched as of 18 june 2008 1 661 police officers and only one formed police unity were deployed without adequate police support troops are left to assumes the roles of both soldiers and policemen conducting patrols inside camps and communities without the proper training to do so
2561745 we also need to look urgently at broadening the participation in this peacekeeping force security council resolution 1769 which gives us our mandate in darfur speaks of the predominantly african character of unamid it does not say the peacekeeping force must be exclusively african given the understandable constraints among african contributing nations we should now be able to turn to those non african countries willing and able to assist our mission at short notice darfurians deserve nothing less
2561746 attack on unamid forces in darfur the khartoum regime is responsible
2561747 militiamen in sudanese army uniforms ambushed a convoy of nigerian peacekeepers in darfur robbing them of cash and weapons united nations officials said friday no one was wounded in the attack which took place on wednesday may 21 2008 near geneina the capital of west darfur state but it was nonetheless a humiliating blow to the hybrid united nations and african union peacekeeping force which is struggling to prove it can do better than the african force it replaced
2561748 the unamid security officer went to the market area in el fasher yesterday may 21 2008 to investigate a road accident involving a un staff member a military vehicle and a taxi according to unamid he had just started taking pictures of the scene when a small group of military personnel assaulted him despite the intervention of unamid civilian staff
2561749 s ets out for the first time which states have the necessary helicopters and estimates how many are available for deployment to darfur it identifies a number of countries including the czech republic india italy romania spain and ukraine that have large numbers of helicopters that meet the required specifications and are not on mission or mission rotation elsewhere many of these helicopters are gathering dust in hangars or flying in air shows when they could be saving lives in darfur
2561750 using conservative estimates the report calculates that nato alone could provide as many as 104 suitable helicopters for the unamid force among nato countries those countries best placed to provide helicopters to unamid are the czech republic italy romania and spain in addition ukraine and india both countries that traditionally contribute to un peacekeeping missions could together contribute 34 helicopters between them these six countries could provide an estimated fleet of over 70 helicopters four times the number required by unamid countries with the ability to provide these helicopters must do so immediately and security council members especially the five permanent members must engage in concerted diplomacy to make sure this happens
2561751 for those who fled their village as long as five years ago those who have waited in camps for an international force to make it safe enough for them to return home unamids performance has been a crushing blow we thought they would save us said zahara khetir a 60 year old mother of 10 living in zamzam camp 16 miles outside el fasher but there is no change we are just waiting for when we will die the town she fled from tawila is still being attacked the most recent janjaweed offensive was last month the un troops stationed there watched as the market was burned and homes were looted
2561752 we are expecting one battalion from ethiopia and one battalion from egypt in june
2561753 current data for total mortality from violence malnutrition and disease
2561754 do we move ahead with the deployment of a force that will not make a difference that will not have the capability to defend itself and that carries the risk of humiliation of the security council and the united nations and tragic failure for the people of darfur
2561755 vi m ste h lla koll p ryssland och fra r ett viktigt verktyg i det arbetet
2561756 some people play hard to get i play hard to want
2561757 all of us are now battling for a place in the team so no one can just expect to wear the shirt
2561758 weve a much larger squad and the boss can now change things if he sees fit
2561759 i was able to throw quality and pacy forwards like paul parry and jay bothroyd on against southampton late on which i couldnt do before
2561760 players like that can change games while ross mccormack who was already leading the line with steve thompson is also quick
2561761 i had four forwards on at the end which highlights the depth of this squad and that is very important for a manager as you need to have a few tricks up your sleeve
2561762 and hopefully i can get one or two more players in to add to the competition for places
2561763 i will wait until the end of the august transfer window if i have to or i might bring in another player on loan but competition for places is so vitally crucial if you want success
2561764 he deserved his start and after his goal the lads were delighted for him and when a striker scores it is hard to take them out of the team
2561765 we had a good bench today players that can change a game and thats what happened
2561766 a draw was a fair result southampton could feel very hard done by because we didnt play well
2561767 i am disappointed not to keep a clean sheet but the most important thing is taking three points

2561773 caucuses inherently disenfranchise the elderly disabled shift workers single parents and others whose circumstance prohibits participation in caucuses
2561774 allow party officials spouses employers or other aggressive participants to exert undue influence and coercion over voters
2561775 its time to eliminate caucuses from the presidential nomination process
2561776 our party is proud that we have put 18 million cracks in the highest glass ceiling
2561777 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all

2561824 all was for the best in the best of all possible worlds
2561825 consider how liberal government authorities like mayor gavin newsom have corrupted the men in blue by stipulating that police not prosecute public nudity and indecency at homosexual festivals
2561826 what honour can there be in protecting the public practice of heinous perversions and nudity in the citys streets the shame of pandering politicians is transferred to the cops who were intended to be guardians of the law and public order
2561827 walked around baring their genitals with no fear of being arrested
2561828 one of the citys two open air celebrations of sadomasochism euphemistically called the leather lifestyle by practitioners
2561829 it is telling to us that the same city whose mayor gavin newsom d ignited the same sex marriage crusade in california by illegally issuing gay marriage licenses openly tolerates and celebrates gross perversions nudity and sexual lawlessness on its streets
2561830 ill go even further and call the images depraved and disgusting
2561831 remember this is on the public streets of san francisco
2561832 these photos do not fit in with the slick national gay marketing plan to be sure
2561833 nevertheless the pathetic and debased spectacle is as much an offspring of the glbt movement as the current quest for homosexual marriage the latter radically redefines and corrupts an ancient institution created by god to order relations between man and woman as the basis for family life perverse events like up your alley mock any notion of right and wrong as the reckless pursuit of anything goes tolerance leads governmental authorities to enable and promote evil turning freedom into sexual anarchy while causing a breakdown in law and order
2561834 one san francisco policeman told our volunteers that the police were instructed not to make arrests for indecency on the city streets at
2561835 san franciscos extreme political correctness has turned cops into impotent perversion protectors
2561836 homosexual activists mock and deride americans for truth relentlessly for exposing sordid realities like up your alley and showing you what happens when sexual radicals come to dominate a major city
2561837 they dont want americans to see this side of their agenda but we must face reality and come to grips with the truth that rights based on aberrant sex are not genuine civil rights
2561838 like the pantless perverts wandering around in sneakers only at up your alley the liberals pro homosexual tolerance and diversity program is now fully exposed as a soulless and bankrupt ideology
2561839 according to its precepts nothing can be judged as wrong sexually speaking except of course normal historic judeo christian mores

2561846 people today barely have time to think and mediate calmly and without hurry we live in an agitated and unpeaceful society which makes us incapable of paying attention to the needs of others and even incapable of being alone with ourselves and with god
2561847 for this reason retreats or spiritual exercises visits to shrines and other activities that aid in exterior silence and interior listening are recommended

2561850 this council exhorts christians as citizens of two cities to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the gospel spirit
2561851 nor on the contrary are they any less wide of the mark who think that religion consists in acts of worship alone and in the discharge of certain moral obligations and who imagine they can plunge themselves into earthly affairs in such a way as to imply that these are altogether divorced from the religious life this split between the faith which many profess and their daily lives deserves to be counted among the more serious errors of our age
2561852 to those to whom much is given much more will be required
2561853 this split between the faith which many profess and their daily lives deserves to be counted among the more serious errors of our age
2561854 the brutal consumption of creation begins where there is no god where material is considered only material for us

2561867 first of all we were able to get things going in the passing game there were a lot of positive things happening today
2561868 last year a thing we struggled with was not forceing them to go three and out on the first series
2561869 you cant have long drives like that to start the game
2561870 its not my job i didnt say it in an ugly tone of voice
2561871 i was already freaked out because she was accusing me of stuff i didnt do
2561872 you dont go to jail because you like different restaurants do you
2561873 it gives you peace of mind and that happiness that confidence that the team has confidence in you
2561874 i wanted to try to get this thing behind me so i could focus more on the season
2561875 it will appear as a six year deal but theres a lot of situations where it could end up being as short as three
2561876 it could be four it could be five and it could be six everything ive ever seen in a contract is in this deal
2561877 as ive said many times i believe brian westbrook is the best running back in football
2561878 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking he is true professional and leader on and off the field and its a great deal for both brian and the eagles organization id like to give credit to joe banner todd france and brian for working so diligently in getting this deal done we look forward to brian having a great 2008 season and beyond
2561879 all of us wanted to get the deal done quickly but there was never a threat of what we would do if it wasnt
2561880 what hes done over the last few weeks with this going on and still working i mean he came out when he had strep throat and he practiced he just wants to win so badly and he wants the team to be the best it can be and thats whats always driven him
2561881 you take somebody with that kind of talent and those kind of intangibles that they bring to your team that is the guy you want to make sure is feeling good about things if you possibly can
2561882 it would probably end up being three or four years
2561883 i think its the most complicated contract ive ever seen
2561884 we were able to get things going in the passing game we were able to establish the run game early which kind of softened up the defense youre talking about one of the best defenses in the league here even though they were missing some of their players
2561885 we were able to get things going the way we were able to in practice this is something that we can watch the film and grow on there were a lot of positive things happening today
2561886 we obviously know that last year that was our achilles heel a little bit the one positive thing out of that whole deal is sustaining drives keeping the chains moving eating up some clock picking up some yards and when we get down there being able to capitalize and cap it off with a touchdown
2561887 it gives you peace of mind and that happiness that confidence that the team has confidence in you
2561888 i wanted to try to get this thing behind me so i could focus more on the season
2561889 it will appear as a six year deal but theres a lot of situations where it could end up being as short as three
2561890 it could be four it could be five and it could be six everything ive ever seen in a contract is in this deal
2561891 as ive said many times i believe brian westbrook is the best running back in football
2561892 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking he is true professional and leader on and off the field and its a great deal for both brian and the eagles organization

2561921 for seven workouts in the last eight days there still is quite a bit of energy honestly im pretty pleased with both sides of the ball i thought the defense really flew around and played with a lot of intelligent and intensity you know you can play hard but you have to play smart offensively i thought we made enough plays to be reckoned with we still need to be a little consistent but thats just going to take a little time weve got to find ourselves figure out what we can do exactly but were on the right path
2561922 there were some pretty good licks laid down but the main thing is we stayed healthy thats the number one thing we look for and thats what we gauged halfway through the scrimmage hows our health and it was good so we kept going because when we jog down on the 28th season opener vs wake forest we want everybody feeling good and being at full tilt
2561923 were all the same the guy thats been here five years has still been in the system five months same as the guy that came at midterm some may have some game experience but it might be some different experience with the schemes that were in on both sides of the ball
2561924 i thought the first d really did a good job first o we had a couple things but we quick whistled a couple deals once again just to keep everybody healthy and understanding that this isnt payday payday is the 28th thats when weve got to turn loose and go
2561925 a lot of people did defensively i think had a couple plays and i thought the corners did well crawford had a big play over there offensively of course jeremy sanders is going to bring something to the table for us we need to figure out exactly how to use him but hes definitely got some talents that we need to utilize

2561928 i have never seen such an impressive array of people and organizations coming to the defense of homeschooling the team effort was remarkable
2561929 tens of thousands of california parents teaching over 166 000 homeschooled children are now breathing easier this afternoon
2561930 yes but a growing population with lots of children has a bad worker to dependent ratio as well
2561931 our country is impoverished because there are too many people
2561932 not because my bureaucracy is hopelessly inept lazy and corrupt
2561933 when the population controllers move into a poor country like kenya or peru primary health care invariably suffers
2561934 unless you make it the number one priority we will stop our foreign aid if you do we will increase it
2561935 this is a victory for californias students parents and education community this decision confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children
2561936 i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and home schooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights
2561937 as head of californias public school system it would be my wish that all children attend public school but i understand that a traditional public school environment may not be the right setting for each and every child
2561938 i recognize and understand the consternation that the earlier court ruling caused for many parents and associations involved in home schooling it is my hope that todays ruling will allay many of those fears and resolve much of the confusion
2561939 he gets to keep his love of learning alive the world is his classroom
2561940 this court was under pressure they did it to protect themselves and their reputation those judges want to be supreme court judges they want to move up theyre not going to do anything to upset their careers
2561941 educating your children in your own home preexisted these buffoons that sit on the 2nd circuit
2561942 it preexisted this state it preexisted us parents have been teaching their own children since the beginning
2561943 it is important to recognize that it is not for us to consider as a matter of policy whether home schooling should be permitted in california that job is for the legislature it is not the duty of the courts to make the law we endeavor to interpret it
2561944 our first task interpreting the law of california is made more difficult in this case by legislative inaction
2561945 given the states compelling interest in educating all of its children and the absence of an express statutory and regulatory framework for home schooling in california additional clarity in this area of the law would be helpful

2561961 their daughter elisabeth was with them at the time of the attack

2561977 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2561978 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2561979 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2561980 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2561981 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2561982 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2561983 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2561984 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2561985 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

2561991 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2561992 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2561993 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2561994 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2561995 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2561996 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2561997 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2561998 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2561999 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2562000 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2562001 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2562002 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2562003 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

2562007 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2562008 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2562009 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2562010 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2562011 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2562012 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2562013 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2562014 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2562015 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2562016 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2562017 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2562018 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2562019 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2562020 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2562021 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2562022 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2562023 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2562024 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2562025 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2562026 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2562027 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2562028 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2562029 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2562030 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2562031 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2562032 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2562033 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2562034 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2562035 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2562036 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2562037 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2562038 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2562039 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2562040 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2562041 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2562042 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry

2562265 well be looking to get as far ahead as we can and bowl them out again theres still a lot of hard work to be done for both teams
2562266 we have beaten china twice in the last couple of years and hope to repeat it here
2562267 we have done quite well and even the archers are confident
2562268 india beat china at the asian championships and tri nation tournament at lords last year but of late our women archers have had sporadic performances both individually and as a team
2562269 we were expecting middle rankings so that we have an easy round till the last eight we couldnt have asked for more our team is capable of beating them
2562270 we are not worried about them either we are all focused
2562271 even the archers are prepared for the test we have had some great training both in india and abroad and would like to convert all that effort into medals
2562272 pranitha mentioned the wind factor but kang said no one was overtly bothered by the conditions either
2562273 we have practised in windy conditions as well as in humid conditions in kolkata so these things should not bother us
2562274 the top three places in the individual event went to south koreas park sung hyun yuk ok hee and joo hyun jung as for the team event we will know which turn indias fate takes on sunday
2562275 the entries for participation had closed on august 7 so there is no way monika can come here and participate
2562276 the deputy chef de mission of the indian contingent baljeet singh sethi said as of now the organisers had not accepted her entry and that he didnt see her competing in beijing
2562277 her name has been withdrawn how can she compete she will not be allowed to enter games village
2562278 i have started off well i lost to him by only four points so i am not too worried
2562279 lets see how i advance i started cautiously and tried to measure my opponent its a big stage and here i did not want to falter
2562280 an opponent is an opponent whether i meet him now or in the later stage how does it matter
2562281 dinesh 81kg wasnt lucky as the referee stopped the contest on outscoring his eyes turned moist
2562282 i will go back and train harder for the commonwealth and asian games
2562283 i dont understand how such news is appearing back home
2562284 after two series i had to readjust and stabilise my body position so that i could get some rhythm into my game
2562285 i believe i should have done better overall it was a disappointing score
2562286 avneet singh sindhu meanwhile finished 10 places behind anjali for the young shooter from badal village in punjab though what was more worrying than the ranking were her scores
2562287 i started well but after the first nine in the third series i started to give in
2562288 i tried my best but it wasnt enough i have been practising only to win a medal here and 8230 it was just one of those days when it did not click for me
2562289 if the whole of mankind and jinns were to gather together to produce the like of this quran they could not produce the like thereof even if they backed up each other with help and support

2562335 we have unrealistic expectations for people john edwards like the rest of us is only human
2562336 the truth is a lot of ordinary average americans have affairs
2562337 weve got one of the ablest candidates ever nominated and hes running against a man who really pretty much promises more of the same of what weve had the last eight years
2562338 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2562339 many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention
2562340 the american public has become sensitized to this type of behavior from political leaders
2562341 my experience of him during that time is that he was a very loving giving man and this doesnt make sense at all
2562342 theres just no way he could do it they just grabbed a convenient person
2562343 mine is a story of craving an unreliable account of lusts and troubles that began somehow in 1956 on the day our free television was delivered
2562344 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2562345 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2562346 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2562347 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2562348 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2562349 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2562350 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2562351 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2562352 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2562353 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2562354 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2562355 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

2562377 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2562378 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2562379 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2562380 we will invest about 2 billion over the next two years for the expansion of our telecom network of which 1 5 billion will be spent for gsm while the remaining amount go towards the development of the existing cdma network

2562382 what the caterpillar calls the end of the world the master calls a butterfly
2562383 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2562384 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2562385 how to start companies to live your dreams or trick yourself into thinking youre living your dreams
2562386 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2562387 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2562388 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2562395 robert could you do something to rescue those 14 year olds you mention they are after all the future
2562396 many of us can seem out of touch with the real world do we write about all the forclosures going on no and while were waiting in line for iphones and buying the latest games that can seem pretty out of place right now while people are losing their homes or their life savings
2562397 tech blogging has become way too controlled by pr agents
2562398 so off i go to friendfeed and twitter where there are real people who dont care about the business but who are just looking to use technology to have more fun be more productive or do something more interesting with their lives
2562399 w hile were waiting in line for iphones and buying the latest games that can seem pretty out of place right now while people are losing their homes or their life savings

2562402 often our peacekeepers go where there is little peace to be kept to places where they are quite frankly the only difference between war and peace

2562404 its been said that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing canadian men and women have always been willing to step forward to serve our country and the world in times of need
2562405 our government is proud to honour such selfless service and to be doing our part in restoring canadas strong and independent voice on the world stage

2562443 that god gives us second and third and fourth chances
2562444 salvation happens where theres hope hope happens when you trust god to do right by you if you cant trust god to guide you into and through the unknown then there is no salvation you walk back to egypt and bitch about being a slave again blaming god the whole time you gotta sacrifice if you want to be liberated and sacrificing yourself is an act of trust that god is righteous
2562445 do you think jesus was a white guy or a black guy

2562455 in this country we dont talk about our sex lives in public
2562456 it was very difficult for the players to move on that quickly we only had three hours to deal with everything
2562457 the players called their parents we were supposed to have a technical meeting but we didnt do it i gave them time to speak to their families
2562458 it was difficult to deal with it was the first time in my life that i had to deal with something like that before a game
2562459 we are just going to say that our hearts go out to elisabeth and her family

2562461 section 377 of the ipc which criminalises men who have sex with men must go
2562462 this is a very positive statement especially coming from the health minister
2562463 this is the first time that i have liked our health minister because this is his first statement to this effect till now he has only made statements about smoking and drinking
2562464 this statement is a step forward as it will add a voice to gay rights activism
2562465 i love exploring new places and also the ones i have already seen it is so much fun
2562466 she adds that the show excited her because the hotels covered on it are in a
2562467 though she likes wherever she goes her favourite hotel is reethi rah in maldives
2562468 it is so exotic that you dont realise when your villa ends and the sea begins
2562469 her concept of the perfect hotel however is that of eco luxury
2562470 an ideal hotel would be one where all material is sourced from the local environment
2562471 the former mtv vj says that her earlier profession had a charm of its own music connecting with the youth and their interests but being a travel show host is far more thrilling
2562472 there is direct interaction with people and you get to learn a lot
2562473 i will never do serials because i dont believe in the kind of shows running these days
2562474 we didnt have any ragging but what we had in our college was called pdp personality development programme freshers would be made to do all sorts of funny things like dancing and singing but guys with work experience who were also new in the college would just stand and give the seniors gyan about how silly this was and how this was not the way theyd do it in engineering colleges
2562475 the seniors were smarter they would generally catch hold of the real fuchchas the older freshers had to be present at the pdp session but were spared the ordeal
2562476 however few of the older newcomers have to face this usually as soon as it is known that a fresher has work experience they automatically get respect
2562477 kids just past 20 came up to me for introduction and when they realised that i was quite senior to them they didnt say anything to me

2562503 receiver steve smith was suspended two games by the carolina panthers after his training camp fight with cornerback ken lucas
2562504 smith a three time pro bowl selection will continue to practice when training camp resumes monday and will be allowed to participate in preseason games coach john fox said saturday
2562505 lucas who left the practice field at wofford college on friday with ice over his left eye has a broken nose fox said smith was kicked out of practice and sent back to charlotte
2562506 the suspension will cost smith more than 205 000 a fraction of his base salary fox also seemed to issue a stern warning toward smith and his future actions

2562509 new sf2a chapters report having their required paperwork lost and other delays that are thrown up by student life offices to delay campus recognition
2562510 i was told by a senior student life staff member that the second amendment discussion was inconsistent with the mission of st marys university so much for the free marketplace of ideas
2562511 the texts of these 26 laws were not made available until august 4 several days after their enactment on july 31 and just as president chavez enabling powers expired under these circumstances neither venezuelas citizens nor the national assembly were afforded the opportunity to participate in debate on these changes this is especially worrisome because many of these new laws appear to mirror proposed laws that were rejected by the venezuelan people during the december 2007 constitutional referendum
2562512 the technology might be advantageous from the operators angle compressed data files transmitted through satellite using mpeg 4 a high definition platform will have better quality however the service providers will have the same cost of bandwidth for using any technology on the customer front the quality will be better but the price of the set top boxes will be higher
2562513 multiplied by the 137 97 billion gallons of gasoline consumed annually
2562514 so the net gain of the much touted stimulus is about 2 billion for all americans or a little more than 6 a person in other words all those stimulus checks are already toast from gas price alone this is not even considering the rapid rise in food prices perhaps it would have been simpler just to have the u s treasury pay exxonmobil bp chevron shell etc

2562521 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2562522 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2562523 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2562524 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2562525 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2562526 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2562527 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2562528 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2562529 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2562530 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2562531 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2562532 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2562533 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2562534 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2562535 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2562536 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2562537 who are open to doing something on the production side
2562538 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2562539 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2562540 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2562541 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2562542 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2562543 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2562544 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2562545 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2562546 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2562547 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2562548 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2562549 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2562550 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2562551 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2562552 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2562553 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2562554 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2562555 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2562556 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2562557 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2562558 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2562559 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2562560 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2562561 once we got it out of our minds for a little bit we were able to focus and play volleyball
2562562 we had a difficult situation and we tried to tell our players to concentrate on the game
2562563 its so painful and its a shame it had to happen they came here to support us they were some of the biggest fans we had
2562564 i think the support from all the fans from china helped tonight
2562565 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2562566 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2562567 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2562568 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2562569 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2562570 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2562571 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2562572 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2562573 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2562574 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2562575 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2562576 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

2562578 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2562579 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2562580 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2562581 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2562582 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2562583 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2562584 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2562585 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2562586 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2562587 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2562588 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2562589 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2562590 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2562591 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2562592 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2562593 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2562594 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2562595 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2562596 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2562597 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2562598 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2562599 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2562600 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2562601 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2562602 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2562603 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2562604 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2562605 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2562606 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2562607 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2562608 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

2562610 theres a little something inside me that says either one could work
2562611 when you look at the history of the u s open and the pga championship it seems like the more difficult it the course is the more americans show up playing well
2562612 but at the same time when youve got a bunch of guys coming in and playing well you want to give them a chance to play golf on an easier layout
2562613 its kind of a catch 22 set it up really really hard and hope for the best or set it up maybe a little easier and say my guys are playing well im going to let them play golf
2562614 if there is an advantage ill look for it but i dont know what that would be
2562615 europes done a great job of exploiting golf course advantage on us for a long time they have the advantage of going to sites the european players all know and the american players dont know
2562616 we dont have that advantage here because most of the europeans who play ryder cup play this tour on a regular basis
2562617 its not like we can go somewhere where they wouldnt know the golf course
2562618 they have been able to somehow neutralise our power in the past by bringing the fairways in at certain points and forcing guys like tiger woods and phil mickelson to hit clubs off the tee where they will end up in the same spot as all of the european players who dont hit it as far as they do

2562653 there are people that are very prepared to break the law in doing this
2562654 this is part of a long history of civil disobedience and there comes a time when the threat of new coal power stations is so great it justifies breaking the law
2562655 if we dont continue to make a fuss no one will listen im not a fan of violence but this is a non violent protest i think trying to shut down a power station is justified
2562656 it is important to take a stand not many locals are joining in and they are burying their heads in the sand

2562709 during lunch mccain said almost with mischievous glee that he had slipped some highly technical questions to james mcclure to ask new democratic governor due to impeachment rose mofford questions she wouldnt be prepared to answer or expected to answer
2562710 flabbergasted i asked mccain why would he want to sabotage moffords testimony when in fact the central arizona project was the nonpartisan pet of republicans and democrats such as far left udall and far right goldwater since its inception
2562711 his reply as near as i remember was ill embarrass a democrat any time i get the chance
2562712 soon found he had to stop mccain from using his good name
2562713 you will recall during my speech at the dinner for the president in phoenix i announced that you were going to give half of the funds you raised to the state republican party

2562728 the constitution of an apex body for management of maritime affairs is an important step which would facilitate quick decision making and rapid response

2562732 prevention is straightforward prevent bites and vaccinate those at risk of bites
2562733 the waraos told us it was because there were too many bats that were biting the children
2562734 this is satire anybody that looks at a drawing of a cartoon and wants to say this is what my presidential candidate is going to be like is already ridiculous and shouldnt be voting
2562735 i think this could be a very positive thing for the obama campaign
2562736 and if you cannot spare each other pain i wish you forgiveness
2562737 sexuality is fluid and you just go with the flow
2562738 love and life are too precious to waste so live and love
2562739 better to have loved and lost than to not love at all
2562740 this is a story about a group of close knit friends not unlike our real lives friends tend to be very forgiving always other relationships may wax and wane but friendships have longevity

2562748 if there will be a serious decision to end the occupation of iraq those cells will vanish
2562749 there will be no reason to let those cells stay and work
2562750 we welcome this announcement that appears to be an effort to help the iraqi people
2562751 the proof is always in the actions and not just the words
2562752 whats most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between russian and georgian military forces
2562753 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
2562754 painful taxes hard choices for your budget not ready to lead thats the real obama
2562755 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2562756 war is never a good thing no one wants it
2562757 they understood the hiroshima bombing because of the japanese military
2562758 when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2562759 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2562760 i wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2562761 to make a major team personnel change compete in the first subdivision and qualify for the team finals is a huge accomplishment and we are looking forward to competing on tuesday
2562762 that was probably the hardest bout ive ever fenced in my career
2562763 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2562764 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2562765 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries
2562766 were facing an economic blockade and this has forced us to take this natural route and march to muzaffarabad
2562767 our produce mainly apples is rotting at least 1 500 truckloads of fresh fruit are waiting to be transported to markets outside kashmir
2562768 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2562769 time will tell but i dont want to say be patient
2562770 i have to get a lot done in a short amount of time they wouldnt have signed me if they didnt think i could do that
2562771 one minute youre in a quarterback battle and the next minute its completely different there are two ways to look at this you can get down about it or turn it into a positive i get to pick the brain of a future hall of famer that chance doesnt come along too often
2562772 it is good to have him here when you play with a legend you cant help but feed off of it i think hell fit right in with both the team and the city
2562773 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year
2562774 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2562775 in the telephone intercepts they always were extremely satisfied when someone blew himself up
2562776 these are people who were radicalized in the west and declared themselves ready to become martyrs for jihad
2562777 if he is out of the picture weapons of mass destruction capability has been set back which would make this one of the more effective strikes in recent years
2562778 i believe that al qaida has no shortage of people adept with explosives and i know that al masri promulgated training manuals for poisons
2562779 but im not sure how skilled any of proteges may be at synthesizing chemical weapons or toxins
2562780 you need both education and hands on experience to produce decent quality chemical weapons or toxins
2562781 from the u s government perspective he was seen as a major threat his potential to develop primitive weapons of mass destruction was not taken lightly by u s law enforcement and intelligence agencies
2562782 the death of abu khabab al masri has a short term impact on operations by eliminating a competent senior leader
2562783 over the long run however al qaida has demonstrated an ability to replace most of its leaders that have been captured or killed
2562784 hamas has agreed to close the file of political detentions and fatah showed its readiness too but there were no measures of datesset for doing so
2562785 for a slim figure share your food with the hungry
2562786 the high marks for self fulfillment are inspiring and encouraging
2562787 it shows big progress more and more women want to achieve their life value which eclipses the importance of the private life for women
2562788 when women start to value self fulfillment they become more equal to men
2562789 love is a beautiful word but power money and sex all represent the negative things
2562790 the awareness and recognition of womens empowerment are relatively low in china
2562791 the country has long been a patriarchial society and still is offering less opportunities and encouragement to women to compete with men
2562792 despite the progress made in gender equality and women empowerment in recent years only 20 percent of the national peoples congress npc members are females
2562793 even in tasks where they do well women seem to shy away from competition whereas men seem to enjoy it too much
2562794 the men who werent good at this task lost a little money by choosing to compete and the really good women passed up a lot of money by not entering tournaments they would have won
2562795 the companies run by women are much more likely to survive
2562796 the typical guy who starts a company is a competitive charismatic leader hes always the firms top salesman but if he leaves he takes his loyal followers with him and the company goes downhill women c e o s know how to hire good salespeople and create a healthy culture within the company plus they dont spend 20 percent of their time in strip clubs
2562797 well i guess you are going to ask for forgiveness tonight when you evaluate your day
2562798 the facts were ugly and we didnt state them to her face i call that gossiping
2562799 well i dont you know what debbie you are just looking to start trouble
2562800 perhaps but i think if you are going to preach you should practice what you preach people who believe they are absolutely right about things scare me a bit

2562815 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state
2562816 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe
2562817 there must be a very strong response on the part of the european union
2562818 after two series i had to readjust and stabilise my body position so that i could get some rhythm into my game
2562819 i believe i should have done better overall it was a disappointing score

2562861 dear ader i had a school friend named homi minbattiwalla in sir j j fort boys school mumbai
2562862 the case was solved only a few days later when a website reader sent in this information
2562863 the case was solved a few weeks later when a delhi based neighbour of the missing uncle wrote in to give his details
2562864 he was at a loss to fathom just why he was
2562865 it was then that i decided to set up a website geared exclusively to put people in touch with missing friends relatives

2562870 they cant accept the fact that somebody who they think is typically bovine and child centric could have an opinion on say tibet these people find it annoying and mystifying that i am just a mommy and my blog is popular
2562871 the mad momma gets nasty feedback not only on her blog but also on other blogs
2562872 my six month old daughter has been called snot eating and shit sniffing there was a post that said that my husband earns rs 40 lakh a month and that i pretend to be poor when i write about recycling things
2562873 now i dont bother why should they get cheap publicity on my blog
2562874 i resent this i use a unisex pseudonym write about things of general interest like cityscapes humour and relationships i find it painful that my identity has to be defined by my gender and not the quality or content of my writing
2562875 women bloggers get a lot of nonsense a lot of it is gendered nonsense some is vaguely flirty and sometimes it begins to seem threatening
2562876 i dont think i would have got certain comments if i were a man there are those who try to make your writing sound like that of a juvenile dumb blonde
2562877 you get to drop the veneer of being civilised its so easy to call a woman a slut
2562878 agrees ajay jain president of the indian blog and new media society
2562879 going by mentality of some of the men in the country women bloggers are easy targets
2562880 venomously yours there seems to be a direct correlation between a woman blogger defying social norms and being a target of vicious attacks
2562881 since a big part of your life is up on your blog from your dog to your pictures and your vacation people get more fodder to get back at you
2562882 you are not getting married because you are a faggot
2562883 if political riots break out i would hesitate to blog on them not because i dont have an opinion but because i would worry about being stalked as a single woman who travels alone
2562884 if you are willing to demolish them intellectually and not personally they will leave you alone
2562885 if you are really serious about blog you have got to be hard skinned these things dont bother me
2562886 he sent me his photographs and mobile number in spite of my warning him he continued to barge my blog with his lewd love confessions
2562887 next he started posting comments on his own blog using her name also using her photo she finally got him off her back by ripping his posts apart on her blog and getting the blogging platform to shut down his blog
2562888 i blog with my name and photos when you start a blog you start with the premise that it will be open to all and you will be exposed to psychos
2562889 its this reason she says that many women bloggers choose to blog anonymously
2562890 the trouble is that you may make it worse by lodging a complaint
2562891 what makes it easier for trolls and stalkers is that it is hard to pinpoint them

2562966 its ridiculous i must be a heck of a writer to produce a pornographic book without sex scenes my book is as realistic a portrayal as i could muster of the prophet muhammads harem and his domestic life of course it has sexuality but there is no sex
2562967 it was my hope that my book would develop empathy for this other culture
2562968 it has always rankled me the way history focuses on men and wars and mens politics and leaves women out i wanted to honour the women in muhammads life by giving them a voice

2563121 dougs had number 39 for the first 20 something years of his career but theres someone on this team that already has it rick dipietro dougs been a great friend of mine for a while and were happy to have him here
2563122 which young player do you most look forward to playing with next season
2563123 its going to be an eventful camp garth has told everyone they need to earn their ice time and spots its going to be lots of fun to see these guys i almost feel like a rookie coming into a new camp i look forward to playing with whoever makes the team its really important that the veterans and rookies feel comfortable together we all expect a lot from the young guys and the old guys
2563124 some of these guys have been in the league so long and know so much
2563125 ill be all ears im going to be fortunate enough to play with these guys and will be very honored
2563126 thanks to the blog box ive had the opportunity to talk to these guys one on one in private but its totally different doing it up on stage in front of so many people
2563127 it took a little bit to psych ourselves up for it but i think it went well bailey seems like such a nice kid and weight is really funny
2563128 you just had to pretend like you were talking to these guys behind the scenes and not in front of everyone we just had to focus
2563129 im really excited about the team this year and to see a couple of the new players in person
2563130 we purchased a plan and had a great time at doolins pub
2563131 all of the islanders were very personable and the kids really liked them this was a good introduction to the new players and a great opportunity for the kids to experience them up close
2563132 the comets are one of the original teams and have been one of the most successful

2563139 people who focus strictly on gdp would have missed a very big story in japan
2563140 much like the us japan had a credit crisis and a residential real estate crash early on yet the first back to back negative quarters of gross gdp didnt happen until the second half of 1993
2563141 waiting for gdp to go down is sometimes like waiting for godot a lot of action happens on the way
2563142 these numbers are going to be revised six ways to sunday
2563143 when i take a look at these four they all peaked and rolled over at different times from last october to february of this year
2563144 so when i do my homework i can see that the recession started i think in january
2563145 an oil shock a housing shock and a credit shock
2563146 housing is the quintessential leading indicator housing peaked in 1988 and then we had a credit crunch in 1989 and then the onset of a consumer recession in 1990 were just replaying an old movie
2563147 policy of rapid movement towards recovery where it is clear the borrower will not maintain payments and we have higher risk

2563150 david strahan argues that oil is now so scarce that it may never be affordable again
2563151 for the world as a whole oil companies are expected to keep finding and developing enough oil to offset our seventy one million plus barrel a day of oil depletion but also to meet new demand by some estimates there will be an average of two per cent annual growth in global oil demand over the years ahead along with conservatively a three per cent natural decline in production from existing reserves that means by 2010 we will need on the order of an additional fifty million barrels a day

2563153 however we should spend the next 10 years getting hydrogen in to production and in to service stations
2563154 i believe that the high price of oil became a turning point for car manufacturers world wide to produce electric and hybrid cars as they had become hostage to the oil companies and stock market speculators
2563155 rising energy prices are not only driving the economy into recession but also fuelling inflation which is running at 3 8 per cent almost double the bank of englands target this creates a major dilemma for policymakers whether to raise interest rates to curb rising prices or cut them to stave off the economic downturn
2563156 the uncertainty on the supply side is even more than the possibility of softening demand
2563157 this is not simply because of political events such as this weeks kurdish attack on the million barrel a day baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline in turkey
2563158 volatility and disruptions in the capital markets became even more pronounced in july
2563159 credit performance has continued to deteriorate and based on our experience in july we anticipate further increases in our combined loss reserves
2563160 the key for fannie and freddie both is do they have the capital to get through the next year or so

2563162 everywhere you turn in itv there are regulatory inhibitions our suppliers are protected by terms of trade which are approved by the regulator
2563163 if we were a monopoly that would be reasonable but in a free market we ought to be allowed to have a free market negotiation with our suppliers
2563164 itv might seek to commission a large number of programmes from its in house production company and squeeze out independents terms of trade have meant a thriving independent production sector that has benefited the whole uk economy

2563171 we expect retail investor demand for mutual funds to be increasingly affected by the volatility of financial markets this will have a negative impact on revenues in our retail business

2563374 take into account the economic health of their customers who pay these prices
2563375 i believe there is no need for an emergency opec meeting why should there be this meeting when oil prices go up the opec members are currently utilizing their full capacity and are supplying the market with oil at us 126 it is not wise for those with oil not to supply it
2563376 i believe it is not that oil is becoming more expensive but the dollar is becoming cheaper
2563377 the near term outlook for oil prices continues to be bullish
2563378 its been a steady upward curve for the last 18 months 14 percent growth in that time and 24 percent in the last three years driven primarily by gasoline prices

2563389 well have to bowl well tomorrow but theyre still behind with two key men out
2563390 he sangakkara held the innings together we needed someone to anchor the innings and thats exactly what he did the concentration he showed is what makes him a world class batsman

2563409 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2563410 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2563411 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2563412 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2563413 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2563414 no matter how hard they try they cant stop us now
2563415 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2563416 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2563417 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2563450 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2563451 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2563452 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2563453 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

2563510 we had a hard fought campaign and it was exciting it was a bit like the proverbial rollercoaster but we are now unified and ready to go forward together and it is imperative that each and every one of us think about how were going to help in this election
2563511 we are one party we share one vision and we believe as democrats as independents and repentant republicans in the progress we can make together
2563512 were still working out the mechanics of the four days and our staffs are in communication with sen clintons staffs but i dont anticipate any problems
2563513 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
2563514 i know from just what im hearing theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen

2563545 comparing the complete mitochondrial dna genomes of a neandertal and many recent humans presents a very different picture
2563546 humans are all more similar to each other than any human is to a neandertal and in fact the neandertal sequence is three or more times as different on average from us as we are from each other

2563579 nobody ever will defy russian rule in this part of the world
2563580 this is a 100 percent unprovoked brutal russian invasion and aggression into a sovereign country
2563581 this is a process of annihilation of georgia these were the exact words of a russian official what they are doing is not about conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders it is about controlling energy routes it is about not only scaring georgian people and terrorising us and basically brutalising us but scaring all the people around
2563582 they are going for civilians because it is so easy

2563594 it may have delayed her eventual demise probably slow the cancer down but eventually she would have succumbed to this vicious cancer
2563595 the point here is that the primary tumor was treated
2563596 the bottom line is it probably does happen obviously it happens very rarely because it is the nature of cancer to grow not to regress
2563597 for the true believer or faithful this is a miracle for the true skeptic this is a random or very unusual coincidence for the doctor and scientist we call it complete spontaneous regression of cancer
2563598 im not the praying type but i just wanted to say thank you

2563622 this battle is profoundly important lyme is an insidious growing threat and if we have children we are more cognizant and sensitive i applaud the courage of people such as you who are coming forward
2563623 is woefully inadequate and a new standard for diagnosis needs to be realistically set
2563624 schools need more education on this issue the children suffering with lyme or other tick borne diseases termed tbds may experience a 20 point drop in iq and a drop in grade point average they suffer psychological damage when they are unable to participate in sports lose friends and feel isolated
2563625 the fact that connecticut numbers in 2003 were down 72 percent is the result of the fact that labs are no longer required to report the cases its a paper drop only
2563626 ive treated more than 7 000 cases of persistent lyme and i can tell you its a very complicated disease and its everywhere prevention is impossible only antarctica does not have it
2563627 you must be your own doctor do a tick check every single night find someone else and do it together if you find a tick remove it with tweezers and pull straight up
2563628 you must also think like a doctor lyme disease presents with clinical symptoms that you must learn to watch for
2563629 obviously you must look for the expanding red em rash erythema migrans within three to 21 days after the bite it will disappear even without treatment and may lie dormant for ten months
2563630 there is a universe of organisms that these ticks contain and treatment must be different for each disease you might need more than one drug most people are multiply co infected
2563631 in the office ive seen patients as sick as those with congestive heart failure talk about terrorism being a threat to the united states were looking at an epidemic of lyme and other tbds here and that is the worst threat imaginable
2563632 a patient will also present with high fever and aches and pains as well as a low white cell count high liver functions and low platelets erlichiosis is very specific and can be treated well with antibiotics if it is caught early
2563633 forty percent of those with chronic lyme are co infected with babesiosis it takes a whole battery of tests to diagnose it
2563634 neurotoxins produced by the borrelia spirochete or lyme disease bacterium also interact with heavy metals in our cells
2563635 we repeated the experiment doing a double blind test with saline instead of the glutathione
2563636 all these chemicals in our bodies cause inflammation and glutathione seems to act like a sponge that pulls them out im very excited about this

2563639 rather than interviewing incarcerated burglars they set out to find active burglars in the community they drew on a network of people who they believed were likely to know criminals interviewees would introduce them to burglars who in turn would introduce them to other burglars this approach introduces a selection effect of course but avoids the obvious selection bias arising from only interviewing burglars in prison
2563640 using detailed information on the timing and scope of changes in state law we study how registration and notification affect the frequency of sex offenses and the incidence of offenses across victims and check for any change in police response to reported crimes we find evidence that registration reduces the frequency of sex offenses by providing law enforcement with information on local sex offenders as we predict from a simple model of criminal behavior this decrease in crime is concentrated among local victims e g friends acquaintances neighbors while there is little evidence of a decrease in crimes against strangers we also find evidence that community notification deters crime but in a way unanticipated by legislators
2563641 we were a bit casual in possession at times and didnt start the second half well
2563642 but we got a little break when they missed the penalty
2563643 when its 0 0 and someone saves a penalty its always a turning point we started to play a bit better after that and i felt a goal was deserved
2563644 it was just important to get off to a winning start after the problems in midweek its never easy coming here so in the context of the match it was a good result
2563645 we were fairly close especially the second set it was just a matter of keeping my nerve not thinking about what the score was just playing the point
2563646 i tried everything and it was very close this was a very important game for me of course i am disappointed but that is how it goes

2563667 the law school has been unwilling to engage in any significant preferential affirmative action admissions program there are doubts according to one member of the law school administration regarding the legality of such a policy the reluctance to compromise normal admission quality standards appears to be particularly present regarding the full time program there appears to be slightly more flexibility regarding the part time program at least one person stated that this was in part related to the schools efforts to improve its rating in us news and world report which apparently only uses the admissions data on full time programs

2563670 in the progress of the division of labour the employment of the far greater part of those who live by labour that is of the great body of people comes to be confined to a few very simple operations frequently to one or two but the understandings of the greater part of men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments the man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations of which the effects are perhaps always the same or very nearly the same has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur he naturally loses therefore the habit of such exertion and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible to become for a human creature to become

2563680 cravath believed that a staff trained within the office would be better adapted to its methods of work and hence he insisted that the staff be recruited so far as possible from men just out of the law schools
2563681 cravath could not tolerate the inefficiency and divided loyalty implicit in such an arrangement e very associate including the man fresh from law school was put on a salary
2563682 the art of delegation in the practice of the law is difficult requiring the nicety of balance which many men with fine minds and excellent judgment are unable to attain the more nearly he attains the right compromise between doing all the work himself or turning everything over to an assistant the greater the amount of effective work a man can turn out and hence the greater his value to the firm

2563703 they are the errors that afflict everyone in public life word stumbles long vacant pauses and name confusions but the impression is dire for a person who wants to be president
2563704 the point is that if were putting more money into education into treatment into prevention and reducing the demand side then the ways that we operate on the criminal side can shift i would start with nonviolent first time drug offenders the notion that we are imposing felonies on them or sending them to prison where they are getting advanced degrees in criminality instead of thinking about ways like drug courts that can get them back on track in their lives its expensive its counterproductive and it doesnt make sense

2563733 regulation is never an easy job but the failings that have been revealed in this case appear to be on a spectacular scale in a meticulous and comprehensive report the ombudsman has made ten serious findings of maladministration leading to injustice we trust that her report will receive the considered and respectful response from government that it deserves the ombudswoman has now invited parliament to give consideration to the recommendations in her report particularly in the area of remedy as the committee charged with examining the ombudsmans reports we will be holding public hearings in the autumn not only on equitable life but also on the wider questions raised by the ombudsmans report

2563736 in a universe of blind physical forces and genetic replication some people are going to get hurt other people are going to get lucky and you wont find any rhyme or reason in it nor any justice the universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is at bottom no design no purpose no evil and no good nothing but blind pitiless indifference

2563739 although raised an atheist keir hardie was converted to christianity and became a lay preacher at the evangelical union church christianity was to become an important influence on his political career
2563740 keir hardie was energised by an evangelical faith and values that stirred his passion for political life throughout he saw his faith and politics as one the impetus which drove me first of all into the labour movement and the inspiration which carried me on in it has been derived more from the teachings of jesus of nazareth than all other sources combined he once said
2563741 keir hardie steered the labour movement away from what he regarded as the damaging influence of marxism and towards a moderate low church and trade unionist version of socialism that was practical flexible and helped create a socialist party that with time has been more electorally and politically successful than most socialist parties outside scandinavia

2563752 the world is at the brink of a new and dangerous phase one that combines widespread proliferation with extremism and geopolitical tension some of the terrorist organisations of today would have little hesitation in using weapons of mass destruction to further their own nihilistic agendas al qaeda and groups linked to it may be trying to obtain nuclear material to cause carnage on an unimaginable scale rogue or unstable states may assist either willingly or unwillingly the more nuclear material in circulation the greater the risk that it falls into the wrong hands
2563753 while washington is in possession of about 5 000 deployed warheads russia is reported to have well over 6 000 making its stockpile the largest in the world it is difficult to understand why either the american or russian governments feel that they need such enormous numbers of nuclear weapons

2563757 few of us would think to question the safety of our prescription drugs after all theyve been developed to make us better but just how safe are they really and is the official drug watchdog doing enough to protect us last month for instance it was revealed that the number of powerful anti psychotic drugs being prescribed to children had almost doubled in past six years yet despite the growing evidence that these drugs can seriously harm children causing excessive weight gain a rise in blood pressure severe lethargy and even lactation the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency is powerless to limit their use the problem is that these drugs arent officially licensed for use on children they are given on doctors own authority and the mhra is not able to interfere in other areas where the mhra does have power to act it turns out to be a watchdog with rubber teeth critics say it simply isnt robust enough

2563761 the vapors from the volcano were found to consist overwhelmingly of thc the major active component in marijuana whereas the combusted smoke contained over 100 other chemicals including several polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons pahs carcinogenic toxins that are common in tobacco smoke the respiratory hazards of marijuana and tobacco smoke are due to toxic byproducts of combustion not the active ingredients in the plant known as cannabinoids
2563762 it is important not to place too much weight on the detailed output from any forecasting exercise of this kind what matters are the directions of anticipated change and the broad orders of magnitude our analysis does however point to a number of conclusions the headline number of ib claimants will show no tendency to fall away as a cohort of former industrial workers currently on ib finally reaches pension age rolling out the pathways to work initiative at its current effectiveness could be expected to reduce the number of ib claimants by around half a million in 10 years reaching the governments target of one million off ib would require the proposed reforms to have an overall impact equivalent to double the current impact of pathways to work rolled out across the whole country there are enough hidden unemployed on incapacity benefits to allow a reduction in ib claimant numbers of one million but only if the reduction is heavily skewed to the north scotland and wales employment growth in the north scotland and wales would need to accelerate sharply or other sources of new labour supply would need to dry up if big reductions in ib claimant numbers are to be absorbed in the north scotland and wales the required reduction in ib claimant numbers substantially exceeds the reduction in claimant unemployment since 1997 having an overall policy impact on ib claimant numbers equivalent to double the current impact of pathways to work and delivering that impact across the whole country is a tall order but it is the last three points regarding the regional dimension that really expose the weakness in the strategy to lower ib claimant numbers put simply there seems little prospect of achieving the one million target without a sustained acceleration in employment growth in the north scotland and wales in the absence of this growth the most likely outcome in these regions is that most or all of any reduction in ib claimant numbers will simply boost the numbers in other jobless groups including the claimant unemployed we would question whether the policies are in place to deliver this acceleration in regional job growth nationally the long period of economic growth driven by consumer spending and rising debt may be drawing to a close and public finances preclude further big increases in public sector employment in the north scotland and wales big reductions in eu regional aid will begin to bite from 2007 onwards the upshot is that we think it unlikely that over the next few years the economies of the north scotland and wales will be able to absorb the very big reductions in ib claimant numbers that the government needs to hit its one million target if a reduction in ib claimant numbers of one million within 10 years is not practicably attainable at least within the present economic and policy context there are important implications for the governments proposed reforms in particular the government needs to recognise that in introducing employment and support allowance to replace ib it is perhaps unreasonable to apply a blanket expectation to all but the most severely ill claimants to undertake return to work activity for a great many ib claimants the prospects of a successful return to work are likely to remain slim partly because of their health or impairments partly because of complicating factors such as poor qualifications and skills and partly because of the difficult labour markets they face in some parts of the country they are unlikely to be employers first choice there is little point in raising false hopes among men and women who by virtue of age skills ill health or location are likely to find re entry into the labour market highly problematic compulsion is likely to be unpopular and it does not make sense to target time and resources at men and women who will resent the intervention the governments aspiration to deliver a reduction of one million in ib claimant numbers may be laudable but until all the uk regions are capable of absorbing big numbers back into work it would be best to proceed sensitively and pragmatically

2563787 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2563788 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2563789 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2563790 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2563791 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2563792 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield
2563793 to be more precise it will be 5 7 percent if the summer holds no inflation that means if the consumer price index doesnt budge for july august and september the benefit increase will be 6 1 percent if inflation runs at the 0 2 percent core rate for the same period and it will be more if inflation is higher than the core rate the last time there was a larger increase was 1982 when it clocked in at 7 4 percent

2563797 weve studied it to death lets get on with it
2563798 the new highway will reduce our stress levels which is a good thing for all of us
2563799 to build a new highway through the wetlands and the agricultural land is a foolish waste of money and does not meet our transportation needs
2563800 adding highway capacity will never resolve gridlock issues because new highways and lane expansions actually encourage people to drive more often which means that new highway capacity is always behind demand
2563801 i guess garfield doesnt think the green party will ever form the government

2563803 a large number of the nurses that have been hired recently are not hired in full time jobs
2563804 it demonstrates that howard and the provincial team have confidence in this riding and in our ability to run a very strong campaign theres an opportunity for us to make some headway here so howards visit was validation for me as a candidate that this riding is on the radar of the provincial office
2563805 its invigorating it suggests the district is important and that the leader has been advised that the candidate is worthy of support
2563806 kitchener waterloo gets a lot of attention because we have a ctv outlet here
2563807 if that television station wasnt here was in hamilton for example wed get no exposure we also benefit from a local that has some wide coverage thats certainly a consideration
2563808 sometimes the provincial office tells you that having the leader elsewhere is a good thing since theyre confident the campaign is in good hands and hes focusing elsewhere in the province
2563809 he wasnt technically in my riding at the time but he was on the border of the neighbouring riding so ill claim him too so hes been here and hes coming here and its always good to see him
2563810 howards paying attention to the issues of this riding it backs up the local candidates message that in this instance the students almost a third of the population here matter to us
2563811 howard hampton came to the university of waterloo because the party was hopeful that one or two people would get energized enough to join the party volunteer and possibly run for office someday to say that youve met a leader can be quite meaningful and empowering and motivating and this is the time when people are attentive and interested
2563812 wants to represent everyone in the riding and not be tied down by a particular party
2563813 the more i think about it and read about it i am in favour of first past the post
2563814 okay i understand that my first choice doesnt have enough support to be elected so id rather make sure my second choice gets in rather than having you disregard my vote entirely

2563836 its been a while and it was a good confidence booster for caroline and i
2563837 it was satisfying we took it one step at a time and it was funny we were talking afterwards and we were thinking the same sort of things coming down the track and we were very much in our own boat and focusing on one stroke at a time
2563838 it was good to put it together on the day but weve always been good trainers and weve done some good tests over the last couple of days but until you put it together on the day you cant claim it so it was a good race
2563839 its a bit of deja vu back to athens so it is going to be a long week
2563840 there is a good feeling in the camp but on their past records everyone has performed as they should but its a good day for the kiwi team for sure
2563841 well take a look at the race tonight and see where we can improve
2563842 the big thing was not to get rattled stay in our rhythm and be confident in our speed and know we could come through but we are aware what is coming up semifinals eight good crews six spots its all on it is what you come here for

2563847 its terrible weve been warning the police about this for some time now and nothing has been done
2563848 this is the only country in the world as far as we know where youre allowed to do this its bloody disgusting
2563849 we have a fantastic relationship with police arms officers they are aware of how stringent we are
2563850 weve got a system in place that is trusting people to do the right thing
2563851 theres nothing stopping them from saying i saw his licence its your word against theirs
2563852 i would expect the police to be looking at this and the minister national will be looking at this if we get in later this year

2563860 i like to go to tachias chenglan temple to practice the eight generals performance its a lot of fun we follow all the different gods as we tour around taiwan the greatest thing about being part of an eight generals group is that you can get red envelopes along the way we split the money among group members i became more confident because as long as i am a member of the eight generals nobody dares bully me
2563861 we emphasize honor our performance must stand out and as for fights we can only win not lose we support each other if one of us is in trouble all of us will help none of us is chicken shit anyone asks for trouble only one thing will happen death

2563876 with taiwan and china on each side of the taiwan strait each side is a country this needs to be clear
2563877 i know it would probably be alright if it was just me
2563878 is it apparent that i know my girlfriend that shes not just a bargirl i met on soi cowboy
2563879 next time you need to learn how to say im not thai in thai
2563880 im not im just saying we dont know all those couples we didnt understand what the lady was saying
2563881 you know this is an issue in transitional justice both sides have wronged each other and they ask why should i change they are the ones who wronged us but the truth is if you really want to make things better if you want to help things youve got to be the bigger person and make an effort even though it might not be fair
2563882 is that stuff more important than when someone makes me feel bad why are you able to shake that off but when you read about some idiocy in the presidential elections you cant get to sleep
2563883 yeah that was stupid whyd they have to be that way

2563892 frankly it the visit was not necessary because we are engaged at a number of levels
2563893 why is it so important to have official meetings with taiwanese officials when were already having high level unofficial meetings with them
2563894 its just a change in symbolism if you make them official why is it worth the hassle
2563895 i felt guilty once but she woke up halfway through

2563903 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2563904 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2563930 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2563931 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2563932 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2563961 that the fajr used to come upon the messenger while he was in a state of sexual defilement from intercourse from the previous night he would then take a bath and continue fasting bukharee
2563962 if i did not fear that i would make it hard on my ummah i would have commanded them to use the miswaak to brush their teeth for every wudoo

2563966 the prophet had hijaamah done to him while he was fasting

2563972 ang bilis ko silang maka bond si polo ravales kasi nakatrabaho ko na before pero wala kang magiging problema ang sarap nila makatrabaho
2563973 well yon nga ang sinasabi nila na parang its not like that na kapag gma or abs cbn artist ako may conflict din kami talagang trabaho lang ang ginawa namin kumbaga nakahanap din ako ng mga bagong kaibigan
2563974 okay naman kami and masaya kumbaga steady yong flow ng relationship
2563975 ako naman kumbaga thats work hanggat maari nga ako kung ano yong mga personal sana personal yon ayaw ko naman dalhin sa trabaho

2563987 the downfall of the bigger cars was that they were forced to stop so often so while they kept overtaking us we eventually went past them at the next petrol station when they needed to fill up again
2563988 we kept at a decent speed and still averaged around 35 miles per gallon
2563989 having entered for fun and to raise money for the nspcc its fair to say that we were surprised to win and i suppose there is a david and goliath element to our victory
2563990 i think the other drivers initially thought it was a hoax that a smart had entered but they gave us more and more credit as the week went on and at the end they were genuinely pleased that we won
2563991 whilst i think ive converted quite a few of them to the merits of smart ownership the event has just strengthened my admiration for the car
2563992 the ride and economy are outstanding you can park it anywhere and there is room for my golf clubs its just a great little car
2563993 well i have a girlfriend of four years and six months if that can help

2563995 its his opinion and i respect him for that i dont know him personally so i cant ask him why such comment i dont think it will affect me theres been too many opinions about me and some i take into consideration and the rest i just respect
2563996 oh theyre trying to package me wholesome as an actor so dont expect me to don swimwear anytime soon or be as daring as my pictorial

2564011 id like to believe that this is all gods plan rest sa tv at pelikula naman and i think thats a good thing sa tv may naka lineup naman kaso lahat naman ngayon bago pa ang soap wala pa namang natatapos so well see
2564012 nagpapapayat nagpapaganda diet nagpupunta ako ng gym minsan tumatakbo sa village minsan kinakain ko lang oatmeal
2564013 i think it was really a well deserved break in a way parang okey rin happy rin naman ako na napahinga naman ako for a while actually i dont know nga why people are making it a big issue e wala lang naman unfortunately na hospital ako i gained weight so i had to lose the weight bago ako lumabas
2564014 dyusko naman may nabubuntis na nga ngayon ng tatlong buwan lang ewan ko sa kanila hayaan nyo na yun kumbaga lahat naman ng tao may masasabi at masasabi hindi mo naman matatanggal yun at saka kapag hindi ka pinag uusapan hindi ka sikat
2564015 i mean thats the truth di ba especially in this business matakot ka kung hindi ka na pinag uusapan at saka ang tanda tanda na natin sa business na ito memorize na natin yan kung hindi ka nabuntis nagpa rehab ka addict ka kung hindi naman nagpalaglag wala ka nang magagawa tanggapin na lang natin
2564016 okey na actually in a way sabi ko nga sa mommy ko dorothy laforteza baka god really wanted me to get hospitalized because in the long run hindi rin naman kasi magiging maganda for my health yung every time na mina migraine ako ini injection an ako
2564017 umabot na rin kasi sa point na masyado nang matapang ang pain killer na ini inject sa akin hindi na nag e effect thats the reason why i have to stay at the hospital longer kasi ginawan nila ako ng cycle parang from 100 mg every day down to 50 30 hanggang sa no more na
2564018 actually kaya rin naman ako nasanay magpa inject dahil din sa mga taping ko hindi puwedeng mag pack up e kapag nagpapa inject sa hospital in 30 minutes magaling ka na so kumbaga in a way baka god wanted me rin to do something kasi nakakatakot if ill get dependent sa medication maa addict ka talaga and its not good for everyone
2564019 im glad that i have to go through something like that baka sine save lang ako ni god kasi hindi rin magiging maganda ang effect sa system ko at si mom nakakahinga na siya kapag sumasakit ang ulo ko tablet na lang okey na
2564020 nakakatakot talaga kasi ang sa akin noon demerol then after ng demerol whats next morphine na so its not really healthy
2564021 wala rin panghihinayang ako kasi naniniwala ako na lahat naman ng nangyayari sa buhay ng tao lahat yan may dahilan whether naiintindihan mo or hindi but eventually nga things will always turn out the best for you naman
2564022 i think thats what god wants me to go through and nag break muna ako sa tv and now im going to do naman a movie so okey lang i dont mind di ba masaya

2564177 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock

2564185 it was very difficult for the players to move on that quickly we only had three hours to deal with everything
2564186 the players called their parents we were supposed to have a technical meeting but we didnt do it i gave them time to speak to their families

2564190 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2564191 i think parents need to realize theyre not zapping kids for not having a hall pass
2564192 i think we can say if we can break up a fight in the hallway in a traditional way then whats the point of a taser
2564193 the problem we see around the country is police use tasers when less force would be appropriate
2564194 once you have the taser and its been accepted and legitimized i see nothing wrong with officers being able to use it on teenagers
2564195 probably the majority of my concern is protecting staff and students from something that could happen from outside the school
2564196 you want to be prepared if youre not its too late

2564212 we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region thats very industrially active
2564213 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming

2564216 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
2564217 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations
2564218 however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games

2564229 i would suggest that there are significant differences in the needs styles and practices of leaders depending upon a host of cultural or identity factors including age but age does not stand alone youth like adults are unique combinations of age ethnicity gender sexual orientation life experience and other factors
2564230 coming of age in a multitasking milieu and now entering a work world flush with inter departmental teams and projects the millennial generation may have an advantage over their colleagues a natural inclination to keep in touch with others communicate and collaborate
2564231 generation y is much less likely to respond to the traditional command and control type of management still popular in much of todays workforce

2564239 anytime you have training its going to be a benefit to you
2564240 we notice an increase in the severity of the injuries even if its a mild wreck on a motorcycle
2564241 a lot of patients who have been in a motorcycle wreck we try to get out of here and fly to vanderbilt university medical center in nashville and get them to a level 1 trauma center because of head trauma
2564242 we felt the squeeze at the beginning of this year fort campbell deployed and they are our bread and butter
2564243 i paid more annually to insure my full size pickup than i do to insure my motorcycle
2564244 for all intents it appears to be a random attack by a deranged man
2564245 the only thing weve heard is they were not identifiable except for a small volleyball pin which would probably be invisible to a guy
2564246 its certainly a down day certainly for the u s people
2564247 here it is supposed to be a great time of happiness and peace and all that thats what we work hard for then for one person to be able to put a dark cloud on that
2564248 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2564249 i dont know if theres another word for it we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goosebumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2564250 so far our database check and preliminary analysis suggest that todays murder suicide was an isolated though brutal murder of one person and assault on two others
2564251 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2564252 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2564253 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2564254 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2564255 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2564256 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2564257 goods that are faulty or which do not comply with specifications shall be replaced free of charge by the supplier
2564258 thank you for your order which is receiving our attention
2564259 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2564260 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2564261 well cater the program and the learning and hes been working incredibly hard he quarterbacks coach brian daboll and offensive coordinator brian schottenheimer have already spent a lot of time together well take it in chunks
2564262 hes a tough worker and fits in with the dynamics of how you play
2564263 and joe vide stepped up and did a solid job in the middle i thought competitively it was day and night to last week
2564264 anything less than three points is going to be a disappointment and just make it tougher on ourselves in the future
2564265 the french cycling federation ffc is dealing with the case
2564266 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2564267 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2564268 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2564269 theres a little something inside me that says either one could work
2564270 when you look at the history of the u s open and the pga championship it seems like the more difficult it the course is the more americans show up playing well
2564271 but at the same time when youve got a bunch of guys coming in and playing well you want to give them a chance to play golf on an easier layout
2564272 its kind of a catch 22 set it up really really hard and hope for the best or set it up maybe a little easier and say my guys are playing well im going to let them play golf
2564273 if there is an advantage ill look for it but i dont know what that would be
2564274 europes done a great job of exploiting golf course advantage on us for a long time they have the advantage of going to sites the european players all know and the american players dont know
2564275 we dont have that advantage here because most of the europeans who play ryder cup play this tour on a regular basis
2564276 its not like we can go somewhere where they wouldnt know the golf course
2564277 they have been able to somehow neutralise our power in the past by bringing the fairways in at certain points and forcing guys like tiger woods and phil mickelson to hit clubs off the tee where they will end up in the same spot as all of the european players who dont hit it as far as they do
2564278 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
2564279 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
2564280 we are thrilled to participate with cushman amp wakefield on this re branding effort and we welcome this opportunity to continue to work closely with one of the most dominant brands in real estate

2564469 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2564470 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2564471 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone
2564472 it was such a popular show because of his bigger than life persona
2564473 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2564474 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2564475 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2564476 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2564477 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2564478 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977

2564480 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2564481 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2564482 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2564483 because he seemed so proud and stayed true to chicago
2564484 he was from chicago i watched his shows i liked him on kings of comedy and he was good for black men its sad that he died so young
2564485 ive gotten a lot of questions the last few weeks asking if obama is the antichrist
2564486 i tell everyone that i dont think the antichrist will come out of politics especially american politics
2564487 i can see by the language he uses why people think he could be the antichrist but from my reading of scripture he doesnt meet the criteria there is no indication in the bible that the antichrist will be an american
2564488 it should be known that in 2008 the world shall be blessed they will call him the one
2564489 a nation healed a world repaired we are the ones that weve been waiting for

2564518 we could find no evidence to support taking antioxidant supplements to reduce the risk of dying earlier in healthy people or patients with various diseases
2564519 the findings of our review show that if anything people in trial groups given the antioxidants beta carotene vitamin a and vitamin e showed increased rates of mortality there was no indication that vitamin c and selenium may have positive or negative effects so regarding these antioxidants we need more data from randomised trials
2564520 the bottom line is that current evidence does not support the use of antioxidant supplements in the general healthy population or in patients with certain diseases
2564521 the world just got a little less funny he will be dearly missed
2564522 bernie mac was one of the best and funniest comedians to ever live but that was the second best thing he did bernie was one of the greatest friends a person could have losing him is like losing 12 people because he absolutely filled up any room he was in im gonna miss the mac man
2564523 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2564524 its a tremendous loss because of his age and the fact that he was such a vital original human being when i use the word original i really mean it he was like no other person i knew he lived his life to the fullest even when we were on the set of oceans he had his own little apartment and he cooked and invited people to lunch every day and he had food that was for everybody he made very exotic things his conversations were always different that any conversations i had with anyone else they were very family oriented he talked about his wife and children with such love and its very hard to believe that hes not with us anymore
2564525 his passing is such a major loss to the acting and comedy communities bernie mac was the personification of the word real he kept it real that kind of genuine spirit that he carried all the time cannot be easily duplicated but i will do my very best to try

2564552 a number of people looking down their noses at me when i explained what i did for a living as if i painted watercolors of cats or performed as a clown at parties
2564553 it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp
2564554 of all the beastly slushy out of the way places to live in this is the worst pathways a bog and the roads a torrent i dont know what people are thinking about i suppose because only two houses on the road are let they think it doesnt matter
2564555 when he went away he was a slip of a youth in the warehouse now look at him
2564556 i should like to see those old temples and fakirs and jugglers
2564557 what was that you started telling me the other day about a monkeys paw or something morris
2564558 well its just a bit of what you might call magic perhaps
2564559 its just an ordinary little paw dried to a mummy
2564560 it had a spell put on it by an old fakir
2564561 a very holy man he wanted to show that fate ruled peoples lives and that those who interfered with it did so to their sorrow he put a spell on it so that three separate men could each have three wishes from it
2564562 i dont know what the first two were but the third was for death thats how i got the paw
2564563 if youve had your three wishes its no good to you now then morris
2564564 i threw it on the fire if you keep it dont blame me for what happens pitch it on the fire again like a sensible man
2564565 hold it up in your right hand and wish aloud said the sergeant major
2564566 dont you think you might wish for four pairs of hands for me
2564567 if the tale about the monkey paw is not more truthful than those he has been telling us
2564568 he didnt want it but i made him take it and he pressed me again to throw it away
2564569 why were going to be rich and famous and happy wish to be an emperor father to begin with then you cant be henpecked
2564570 i dont know what to wish for and thats a fact
2564571 if you only cleared the house youd be quite happy wouldnt you
2564572 well wish for two hundred pounds then thatll just do it
2564573 it moved he cried with a glance of disgust at the object as it lay on the floor
2564574 as i wished it twisted in my hands like a snake
2564575 never mind though theres no harm done but it gave me a shock all the same
2564576 i expect youll find the cash tied up in a big bag in the middle of your bed
2564577 and something horrible squatting up on top of the wardrobe watching you as you pocket your ill gotten gains
2564578 the idea of our listening to such nonsense how could wishes be granted in these days and if they could how could two hundred pounds hurt you father
2564579 that you might if you so wished attribute it to coincidence

2564589 i was to say that maw and meggins disclaim all responsibility
2564590 they admit no liability at all but in consideration of your sons services they wish to present you with a certain sum as compensation
2564591 why didnt i think of it before why didnt you think of it
2564592 well have one more go down and get it quickly and wish our boy alive again
2564593 get it quickly and wish oh my boy my boy
2564594 he has been dead ten days and besides he i would not tell you else but i could only recognize him by his clothing if he was too terrible for you to see then how now

2564597 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league

2564609 our peacekeepers along with reinforcement units are currently conducting an operation to force the georgian side to accept peace
2564610 the people responsible for this humanitarian disaster need to be held liable for what they have done

2564667 i love you too i fought to find you as soon as i saw you i loved you youve haunted my thoughts you left so soon
2564668 it is simple yet it is not every human is born one along the way one become 2 the first hurt you have the first taste of pain you become good or bad the path of life simply tips the scales some are lucky and have it easy some are not some are special some survive some do not some care some stop you had a vast chasm between your good and your bad your conscious and sub conscious it is how you survived you are strong in many ways
2564669 a whole hellva lot more than i thought was there
2564670 ha ha yes think of this how do you do what you do
2564671 now were not talking about you getting violent or in any way even demonstrating other than through peaceful means
2564672 were talking about peaceful revolution here which is resolution to the various situations that you have
2564673 the first thing to do is make sure that you have that capacity
2564674 however you want to envision it just wrap yourselves in it and whatever its composed of its full of oxygen so you keep breathing this is not a blanket to smother you but rather the air of freedom that you are breathing out and making a beautiful beautiful hugging enclosure around you
2564675 the more you breathe it in the more you breathe in the empowerment
2564676 whatever it is keep creating it and notice it might be feeling particularly cool and refreshing like the ions coming at the top of the mountain by the rushing stream or the river by the sea with its waves so refreshing so wondrous to feel keep it going keep it going
2564677 you are the creator and you are the giver and the receiver of this wondrous air of freedom so just allow yourselves to be totally immersed in this inside and outside of your wondrous beings
2564678 and this goes into your energy fields does it not
2564679 free yourselves send it to that which you call your future so that your moments to come are all moments of enjoyment of this breathing of the air of freedom
2564680 now it may be that in your minds eye youre starting to see symbols of freedom
2564681 and now you have a message that you can send with that to all of those who wear the hats of the dark
2564682 you are free to move upon your own divine path of ascension and there is nothing that they can do that will stop you from that
2564683 and you have sent the messages out to your entire circle of being and beyond that you have in this exercise created and empowered and enlarged even beyond physicality the air of freedom and you have taken it in you have breathed it in to all of your being and you have breathed it out beyond all of your being so that it empowers others it inspires others and it serves as a message to all of planet earth and beyond now stand tall in your freedom beloved ones treasure it and cherish it and above all else keep on breathing it
2564684 come on shelly why dont you just change another brain
2564685 hoy m s que nunca debemos rodear a nuestro equipo los hinchas la prensa y la clase dirigente de la regi n
2564686 as como el gobernador villamizar da su respaldo al equipo as queremos que lo rodeen otras instituciones para que logremos ser una sola voluntad y podamos superar los malos momentos que estamos viviendo
2564687 theres no such thing as having too much fun but i could try
2564688 oh well the day is blown so i might as well eat this and this and this
2564689 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document as outlined in mr suskinds book
2564690 now this is from the vice presidents office is how you remembered it not from the president
2564691 what i remember is george tenet saying we got this from basically from what george said was downtown
2564692 but he did not in my memory never said president vice president or nsc okay but now he may have hinted just by the way he said it it would have cause almost all that stuff came from one place only scooter libby and the shop around the vice president
2564693 i would naturally i would probably stand on my basically my reputation and say it came from the vice president
2564694 but there wasnt anything in the writing that you remember saying the vice president
2564695 you know if youve ever seen the vice presidents stationery its on the white house letterhead it may have said ovp office of the vice president i dont remember that so i dont want to mislead you
2564696 this posting is contrary to my practice across 25 years as a journalist but the issues in this matter are simply too important to stand as discredited in any way
2564697 i would say right it came to us george had a raised eyebrow and basically we passed it on it was to and passed this on into the organization
2564698 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2564699 a lot of times if youre friends with one you make it hard to be friends with another
2564700 rudely interfered with chinas internal affairs and sent a seriously wrong message to anti china hostile forces
2564701 my presence in beijing will confirm it once more the friendship between france and china is a fundamental axis of frances foreign policy
2564702 they say we create a negative image they treat us like refugees and criminals
2564703 they are cracking down on us more than ever before they regard us as enemies who will disrupt the stability of the country
2564704 they ask us to embrace the olympic games to love the country love the party but they dont love us
2564705 are you sure youre okay to drive i have to think about bo you know
2564706 please please dont make me wait to pick these up
2564707 you look like youre in a lot of pain you should call this guy hes fantastic for back work
2564708 i appreciate the sentiment but im afraid my pain is self imposed
2564709 ha only in la well uh i guess keep the card for another time
2564710 spent a number of years lobbying on behalf of georgia and has publicly taken strong pro georgia anti russia positions
2564711 has developed a very close relationship with president of georgia mikheil saakashvili and many senior georgian officials
2564712 the government of georgia has called for a cease fire and for a resumption of direct talks on south ossetia with international mediators the u s should immediately convene an emergency session of the united nations security council to call on russia to reverse course
2564713 the us should immediately work with the eu and the osce to put diplomatic pressure on russia to reverse this perilous course it has chosen we should immediately call a meeting of the north atlantic council to assess georgias security and review measures nato can take to contribute to stabilizing this very dangerous situation finally the international community needs to establish a truly independent and neutral peacekeeping force in south ossetia
2564714 the 1980 carter doctrine that the us was determined to dominate the persian gulf is at the root of the first gulf war of the present iraq war and of the possible war on iran brzezinskis grandiose schemes of world transformation caused a renewal of the cold war and gave birth to al qaeda and without soviet restraint the results could easily have been far more tragic than they turned out to be
2564715 this project means that americans will be committed to fight and die for a gangster regime in the caucasus at the far end of the black sea

2564717 his feet dangling and within reach the men and boys played with the corpse by swinging it back and forth against the building to hear the dull thud
2564718 it wasnt in mississippi it was in illinois that jarred people
2564719 add the fact that its where lincoln is buried you have a lot of symbolism lincoln was a live memory to a lot of people
2564720 i found it hypocritical that in this town its all about lincoln we want to embrace him then you find out whoah this is who we are this is springfield
2564721 all day and all night long he had a gun on each shoulder and he marched from where our store was to our home and that was back and forth all evening
2564722 its a history that has to be brought out into the open it really has to be
2564723 it is extremely important that we take time to recognize the significance of the race riots that we teach our children all about them
2564724 and that we rededicate ourselves to the notion that we must all work together to ensure that something like that never happens again
2564725 mrs toguchi prayers are nice and its probably very helpful but you still need chemotherapy
2564726 dear lord youre the one who created my body so i know you can fix it
2564727 i put my whole faith in you father damien please pray for me too because i need your help
2564728 it may have delayed her eventual demise probably slow the cancer down but eventually she would have succumbed to this vicious cancer
2564729 the point here is that the primary tumor was treated
2564730 the bottom line is it probably does happen obviously it happens very rarely because it is the nature of cancer to grow not to regress
2564731 for the true believer or faithful this is a miracle for the true skeptic this is a random or very unusual coincidence for the doctor and scientist we call it complete spontaneous regression of cancer
2564732 im not the praying type but i just wanted to say thank you
2564733 how can my wife make her colostrum better like diet or
2564734 what if your husband works from home mostly at night and kind of wants to feed the baby too but isnt sure when he should do it also he likes the band squirrel nut zippers and wants to name the baby leia if a girl and luke if a boy
2564735 i have to drive an hour and pay an asian medicine expert with two missing front teeth to methodically singe my wife because our baby is breech
2564736 during an attack by what local law enforcement authorities have indicated was a lone assailant
2564737 they were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2564738 out of respect for the families involved we cant say more than that
2564739 after our last house was destroyed you come to a point where you dont want to live across from someone like that
2564740 this guy has to be an extremely unlucky individual lets put it that way its time someone takes a hard look at whats going on here someone is going to get hurt
2564741 we were watching tv and it shook the whole house
2564742 bkmea will submit a proposal recommending the pay rise to the government and over 1 500 factory owners will implement it once the government gives the go head
2564743 we cannot make a decision on the pay rise on our own the government would take a final decision on the matter in line with the labour law
2564744 about eight lakh workers of the knitwear industry have been leading miserable life in the wake of abnormal hike in commodity prices
2564745 this time we have decided to open shops in a large scale ahead of ramadan as the rice price did not ease
2564746 if the problems are not solved the sector will not grow further
2564747 i didnt think id swim that fast in the preliminaries i saw the first few heats go out and i kind of wanted to be the top seed for tomorrow that is all i went out to do
2564748 i couldnt believe it i had a headache this morning i felt so terrible that i didnt know how id shoot so to win the first gold medal of this olympics is pretty amazing
2564749 wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2564750 we have to focus on our own performance and this helps me to relax and not come under pressure
2564751 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection
2564752 it would be stupid for me to take a banned substance just before the games
2564753 the regulations on the employment of indigenous people are at final stages
2564754 no government has implemented the regulations so far the incumbent government will accomplish the task
2564755 the indigenous community has been enriching our culture through their heritage over the years
2564756 boarding schools will be established in the hill tracts where the indigenous community will have the scope to study in their vernaculars
2564757 winning may not be everything but losing has little to recommend it
2564758 it is not possible for the foreign minister of a country to keep track of the countrys guests it is for them to decide
2564759 we expect our guest not to do anything which is causing a problem to any of our citizen and there will no problem due to his or her stay in this country
2564760 giving power of arrest to the army cannot be supported we reject this decision we demand cancellation of this provision
2564761 moreover the army is being given extra powers if the army is deployed during the election the turnout for voting will fall
2564762 our party president sheikh hasina has said no election is acceptable before the national elections
2564763 we agree with her we do not want any election before the parliament election if the government decides to hold upazila polls first awami league will take steps evaluating the situation
2564764 there is no such situation prevailing in the country that the state of emergency should continue
2564765 the government itself is saying that a peaceful and normal situation is prevailing so why the need for the state of emergency
2564766 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2564767 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2564768 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2564769 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2564770 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2564771 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2564772 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2564773 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2564774 youll sing that one song you really like and you like to hear yourself sing so
2564775 to all who are beloved of god in rome called as saints v 5
2564776 dude or dudette you belong you belong to the god who fashioned the world we cannot tame who sent his son into our bloodied and wounded mangers and who chose us in spite of all we do to kindle his wrath
2564777 you want to give em just enough to hook em
2564778 they were less christ centric and more aware of gods providence in their surroundings
2564779 im definitely nervous about what appear to be tribal markers that bind the movement
2564780 the cowboy church works because we are people who like to ride and also worship the lord
2564781 so it fits who are but im sure people up in the city sure must think its weird
2564782 you have to pay attention to the horse and you cant hold notes
2564783 so you have to memorize most of what you want to say
2564784 i thought him a very stable solid choice even if he did not do all that much for me there was not the smallest sign that he was well basically bonkers
2564785 he is said to have a five second rule which holds that first instincts are best
2564786 if i had written a critique of traceys show at the venice biennale last year
2564787 this show at the goma is even better there is crescendo and fortissimo
2564788 most parents of overweight or obese ouch children think that their child is a healthy weight

2564792 squeezed in between two departments whose managers are constantly engaging in the most petty dick measuring contests ever
2564793 tell me how you want it done tell me when you want it done and tell me where to go for questions after that leave me alone to do my job
2564794 this may not be such a great idea heres why
2564795 what the hell does she think is going to happen when she starts her residency does she think being a doctor isnt going to make 9 to 6 look like a fucking cake walk
2564796 dont worry your ship will come in youre so smart youre so talented
2564797 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
2564798 the energy will be produced and disseminated through small scale technology we simply would have got rid of most of the extra high voltage wires strung around the country closed up the coal mines oil and gas fields taken down oil refineries and much of the petro chemical establishment
2564799 we are already 5 years into the biosphere self destruct era
2564800 it would be little short of disastrous for us to discover a source of clean cheap abundant energy because of what we might do with it
2564801 will probably spell the end of the car oil steel aluminum nuclear and coal industries as we know them
2564802 giving society cheap abundant energy would be the equivalent of giving an idiot child a machine gun
2564803 the 12 hottest years in history have all been in the last 13 years
2564804 its not a question of debate what about the medieval warming period the historical record shows they were growing wine in england for goodness sake come on it is not disputed by anyone that the vikings arrived in greenland in ad900 and it was warmer than greenland is now what penny wong is doing is being selective and saying that is a long time ago
2564805 land based temperature readings are corrupted by the urban heat island effect
2564806 urban areas encroaching on thermometer stations warm the micro climate around the thermometer due to vegetation changes concrete cars and houses
2564807 that doesnt mean you give up on the science and that you cant draw valid conclusions about the nature of earths temperature change
2564808 create a brouhaha and muddy the waters in the climate change story
2564809 all official measures of global temperature show that it peaked in 1998 and has been declining since at least 2002
2564810 and this is in the face of an almost 5 per cent increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide since 1998 spot the problem
2564811 the changes in temperature over the past 10 years have basically plateaued
2564812 but scientists did not anticipate a gradual year by year warming in temperature what matters is the long term trend this outcome does not change any of the science but it does change the spin climate deniers can put on it
2564813 in the last 10 years we have seen an increase in carbon dioxide levels yet temperatures are coming down that if anyone looks at the actual data is not disputable carbon dioxide is not driving temperatures because there are other important climatic factors at play
2564814 from a climate standpoint it is far too short a period to have any significance
2564815 what we are seeing now is consistent with our understanding of variability between decades if we hung about for another 30 years and it kept going down then you might start to think there is something we dont understand but the evidence at this point suggests this is not something we should hang around and wait for
2564816 in the last 10 years there has been a catastrophic and massive arctic sea ice retreat weve seen glacial retreat permafrost thaw and ocean thermal expansion so temperature is not the whole story
2564817 it is widely alleged that the science of global warming is settled
2564818 this implies that all the major scientific aspects of climate change are well understood and uncontroversial the allegation is profoundly untrue even the most widely held opinions should never be regarded as an ultimate truth

2564830 the restaurants owners hired andersen consulting to revamp all our processes after several months of analysis they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped piece of cutlery it represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour if our staff are better prepared we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man hours per shift
2564831 ill get another spoon next time i go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now
2564832 excuse me but can you tell me why you have that string right there
2564833 not everyone is so observant that consulting firm i mentioned also found out that we can save time in the rest room by tying this string to the tip of you know what we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands shortening the time spent in the rest room by 76 39 per cent
2564834 after you get it out how do you put it back
2564835 two years ago i made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else in 2006 i told elizabeth about the mistake asked her for her forgiveness asked god for his forgiveness and we have kept this within our family since that time

2564840 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2564841 no other details are available at this time we ask that his familys privacy continues to be respected
2564842 he was an inspiration to me one of the great things about john edwards is that hes so open and willing to try new things and do things in new ways
2564843 incredibly nice one of those people for whom no one has a bad thing to say
2564844 one of my researchers recently reported that she placed a pyramid over the cage of an excitable bird the bird immediately flew to the top of the cage in an apparent attempt to get as close to the pyramid as possible and has since remained far more calm than before
2564845 this chest expander is perfect for quick at home or office workouts
2564846 its been a while and it was a good confidence booster for caroline and i
2564847 it was satisfying we took it one step at a time and it was funny we were talking afterwards and we were thinking the same sort of things coming down the track and we were very much in our own boat and focusing on one stroke at a time
2564848 it was good to put it together on the day but weve always been good trainers and weve done some good tests over the last couple of days but until you put it together on the day you cant claim it so it was a good race
2564849 its a bit of deja vu back to athens so it is going to be a long week
2564850 there is a good feeling in the camp but on their past records everyone has performed as they should but its a good day for the kiwi team for sure
2564851 well take a look at the race tonight and see where we can improve
2564852 the big thing was not to get rattled stay in our rhythm and be confident in our speed and know we could come through but we are aware what is coming up semifinals eight good crews six spots its all on it is what you come here for
2564853 its terrible weve been warning the police about this for some time now and nothing has been done
2564854 this is the only country in the world as far as we know where youre allowed to do this its bloody disgusting
2564855 we have a fantastic relationship with police arms officers they are aware of how stringent we are
2564856 weve got a system in place that is trusting people to do the right thing
2564857 theres nothing stopping them from saying i saw his licence its your word against theirs
2564858 i would expect the police to be looking at this and the minister national will be looking at this if we get in later this year

2564930 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2564931 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2564932 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2564933 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2564934 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2564940 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2564941 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2564954 its been a while and it was a good confidence booster for caroline and i
2564955 it was satisfying we took it one step at a time and it was funny we were talking afterwards and we were thinking the same sort of things coming down the track and we were very much in our own boat and focusing on one stroke at a time
2564956 it was good to put it together on the day but weve always been good trainers and weve done some good tests over the last couple of days but until you put it together on the day you cant claim it so it was a good race
2564957 its a bit of deja vu back to athens so it is going to be a long week
2564958 there is a good feeling in the camp but on their past records everyone has performed as they should but its a good day for the kiwi team for sure
2564959 well take a look at the race tonight and see where we can improve
2564960 the big thing was not to get rattled stay in our rhythm and be confident in our speed and know we could come through but we are aware what is coming up semifinals eight good crews six spots its all on it is what you come here for
2564961 before the operation they told me there was a chance i wouldnt be able to walk again after this if something goes wrong during the operation
2564962 my dad taught me how to sail when i was four
2564963 he took me out in a little boat and after a while i said okay i can do it by myself now
2564964 while i was in hospital my dad went out and bought me a new boat
2564965 he said its a really good buy and i know you cant sail now but i just want to entice you to do everything you can
2564966 and i guess all that thinking about it actually got me there
2564967 there wasnt ever really any hesitation in my mind that he wouldnt ever be able to sail
2564968 from the time we started talking about it it was always presumed hed be able to do it
2564969 everyone whos at the olympics has the best equipment has done their boat handling preparation and they all have the skills to win its those who can deal with the pressure each situation and trying to work it out in their mind the communication between the crew and coach and having been through such an ordeal having a lot of time to think about it hopefully i feel should help me
2564970 i have to say its not something that plays in our mind at all anymore
2564971 were here to win a gold medal were not here to just collect a tracksuit and go home the medal is the thing that counts for sure
2564972 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
2564973 independence a taboo subject in the recent past even for those welsh politicians who supported the idea has stepped subtly back into the limelight

2564976 its a story of courage of a very brave service dog taking care of me he passed away i was so depressed i had him cloned
2564977 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2564978 i have been played up as a very wicked and perverted woman
2564979 she is a person of note in our little community
2564980 were not wearing apparel or anything that would have specifically identified them as being members of our delegation
2564981 we dont believe this was targeted at american citizens and we dont believe this has anything to do with the olympics
2564982 im here with my husband and son so its not easy but were living our dreams and were not going to live in fear
2564983 were going to go out there every day and enjoy every day and celebrate it
2564984 our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families
2564985 and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2564986 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2564987 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2564988 this is a very sad day for many of us who knew and loved bernie
2564989 he brought so much joy to so many he will be missed but heaven just got funnier
2564990 doesnt condone these statements and believes what was said was inappropriate
2564991 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2564992 when i say i wanna kill those kids you know what i mean
2564993 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2564994 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2564995 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2564996 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2564997 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2564998 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2564999 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2565000 its truly the passing of one of our favorite sons
2565001 he was extremely innovative in putting his life experiences in comedic form and doing it without vulgarity
2565002 he was an ambassador of chicagos black community and the national black community at large
2565003 the top of it is totally broken off and the storm severely damaged 70 to 80 percent of the tree
2565004 that means theres not a whole lot left of it but it didnt kill the tree
2565005 was there as a silent witness to the battle to the aftermath to the burials to the dedication of the cemetery
2565006 i have no doubt that union soldiers sat under it for all three days of the battle
2565007 when its something this bad its highly doubtful that a tree like that can survive
2565008 its a shame when you lose the last living entities on this battlefield

2565011 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock
2565012 this is probably the toughest course ive ever played the rough is high and even if youre a good driver youre going to miss four fairways and the greens are tricky youre always putting up slopes
2565013 but somebodys going to enjoy it by the end of the week
2565014 they are men and women who tend to believe that the human being is perfectible and social progress predictable and that the instrument for effecting the two is reason they believe that truths are transitory and empirically determined that equality is desirable and attainable through the action of state power that social and individual differences if they are not rational are objectionable and should be scientifically eliminated that all peoples and societies should strive to organize themselves upon a rationalist and scientific paradigm

2565025 when i came back from my mission i realized i had life goals and more of a perspective and i knew what values i have and what is most important in my life i have learned not to limit yourself

2565030 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state
2565031 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe
2565032 there must be a very strong response on the part of the european union
2565033 we did not accept military intervention by milosevics sserbia in other yugoslav states on the grounds of protecting serbian passport holders

2565091 there will be many a tim lahaye reading liberal hating christian nationalist who sees this commercial and will have the circuitry in his brain light up to say
2565092 if youve read the book the way the ad draws upon the characterization of carpathia the antichrist to characterize obama is obvious
2565093 the antichrist isnt going to be an american so it cant possibly be obama the bible makes it clear he will be from an obscure place like romania
2565094 the georgian government committed a crime against their own people when they invaded south ossetia and a delivered a mortal blow at the territorial integrity of georgia after suffering thousands of deaths and enduring a major humanitarian disaster in their homeland it shall be impossible to convince south ossetians to be part of the georgian state this is a heinous crime against the ossetian people i suspect that it is now obvious to the entire world that georgian plans to join nato boil down to a design to enlist outside support for bloody adventures of the kind seen in south ossetia not a desire to join an alliance for international security russia shall always have enormous respect for the fraternal georgian people in spite of the criminal policy of the present government

2565097 when you look at the history of the u s open and the pga championship it seems like the more difficult it the course is the more americans show up playing well
2565098 but at the same time when youve got a bunch of guys coming in and playing well you want to give them a chance to play golf on an easier layout
2565099 its kind of a catch 22 set it up really really hard and hope for the best or set it up maybe a little easier and say my guys are playing well im going to let them play golf

2565117 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2565118 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2565119 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2565120 for almost 10 months the story of john edwardss affair remained the nearly exclusive province of the national enquirer through reports denials news of a pregnancy questions about paternity and finally a slapstick chase through a hotel in beverly hills
2565121 jay leno and david letterman made mr edwards the butt of jokes on their late night shows but their own networks declined to report on the rumors surrounding him on the evening news why
2565122 the three broadcast network newscasts the three cable news networks and most of the major newspapers and magazines did not say a word
2565123 cbs kept track of the story but did not actively pursue it we saw no reason to make his life or the life of his family any worse until it became well documented or he admitted it which is what happened today
2565124 for mccain self confidence on ethics poses its own risk
2565125 this is not about me trying to force a political candidate on you and trying to see how you vote
2565126 i wanted to thank all of you who contributed to mitt romney you cant realize how much leverage this gives huron going forward to ask various people for business

2565129 i had to get my own generators to keep my freezers going
2565130 pool antics and comed antics aside his reputation is as one of the hardest workers anyone has ever met in government as well as campaigns
2565131 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2565132 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2565133 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2565134 you can prove anything you like just by thinking about it
2565135 i left out drugs sex and politics because i cant at the moment think of an equivalent way to quantify them
2565136 but its fairly clear now that with the near certain nomination by the democrats of barack obama everything is in place for the media to indulge in one of the greatest orgiastic media fiestas of hero worship since elvis presley
2565137 the cornel wests and michael eric dysons of the world will turn their outrage knob to 11 if obama fails to defeat john mccain the angry left will fill op ed pages with attacks on middle america declaring that obama was right to castigate working and middle class people as bitter bigoted xenophobic religious zealots if obama wins were in for a humorless four years as hypersensitive obama supporters will conduct a pc witch hunt that will make media matters for america look civil by comparison
2565138 he is the candidate for people who dont believe in god but believe by checking the pressure on their tires they are personally saving the world
2565139 happily never after how hollywood favors adultery and promiscuity over marital intimacy on prime time broadcast television
2565140 its an unoffensive way to show them what happens to something if it isnt cared for and rewarding when you watch it grow and can from it
2565141 the los angeles times was unable to confirm the details in the enquirer reports said craig turner an editor who oversees front page stories for the paper
2565142 to say the journalists should not consider that is reprehensible journalists can be human beings

2565177 we must think about qualifying although schalke are a great team it would be a huge blow to them if we managed to score in their own stadium away goals are important we have to be really focused the entire 180 minutes and i hope it will be solved there but i do not believe

2565190 we shouldnt have to go to restrictions yet so were hoping people can use common sense and understanding
2565191 we want them to remember its extreme fire danger and be super careful with campfires
2565192 we didnt get nearly as many strikes as we expected thursday night

2565200 for a long time in robotics there was this focus on a smart machine an android that would make you breakfast and go out and buy your shopping
2565201 but thats extremely challenging its going to be far easier for us to engineer little simple things and rely on them to organise themselves
2565202 you might have some complex robot that is sent to mars has a technical problem and then the mission is basically over
2565203 with swarm robots even if a percentage of them fails theyll still be able to achieve their goal
2565204 if you design software with typical engineering tools like if this and that then do this its like playing a chess game by calculating all the possible never get there

2565209 we look forward to working with the court the congress and the plaintiffs to bring the case to final closure
2565210 we always believed much more of the money was never collected in the first place
2565211 and thats always been the biggest flaw in the bias system is that they didnt have an accounts receivable system in which they were able to make collection efforts
2565212 far more has never been collected than what was inaccurately distributed
2565213 121 year old perpetual trust managed by civil servants with rapidly multiplying beneficiaries

2565215 any claims that iim holders may have for damages against the government
2565216 its a horrendous slap in the face after 120 years of injustice to have this kind of ruling come down
2565217 its very clear the judges biases in this case were in favor of the government
2565218 he has not even awarded interest in this case its a clear mistake

2565220 when things start to bust open there are not going to be as many deals
2565221 banks are being handcuffed by the regulators in terms of their real estate portfolios or cash reserves
2565222 the result is theyre not lending as much if at all to the real estate industry

2565224 i have a good job i make a good living but its the cash flow
2565225 if i had to put this money down on my own i would not be able to purchase a home

2565239 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2565240 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2565241 they are killing civilians women and children with heavy artillery and rockets
2565242 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2565243 what is going on is a massive bombardment of residential quarters in tshkinvali and other towns too
2565244 will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2565245 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is what is behind the logic of the steps we are undertaking now
2565246 a large part of the city has been destroyed over 15 civilians have been killed several buildings are on fire in the city center and the local parliament building has burned down
2565247 street fighting in tskhinvali has lasted for many hours ossetian home guards are using grenade launchers to destroy georgian tanks eyewitnesses say tanks are burning throughout the city the turning point is approaching in the battle for the capital city
2565248 the things that were happening in kosovo the things that were happening in iraq we are now following the same path the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america south ossetian defense officials used to make statements about imminent aggression from georgia but the latter denied everything whereas the us department of state released no comments on the matter in essence they have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals they are responsible for this the world community will learn about it
2565249 the number of victims with women children and elderly people among them can be counted in hundreds and even thousands
2565250 civilians including women children and elderly people are dying in south ossetia in addition to that georgia conducts ethnic scouring in south ossetian villages the situation in south ossetia continues to worsen every hour georgia uses military hardware and heavy arms against people they shell residential quarters of tskhinvali the capital and other settlements they bomb the humanitarian convoys the number of refugees continues to rise the people try to save their lives the lives of their children and relatives a humanitarian catastrophe is gathering pace
2565251 the georgian administration has found the use to its arms which they have been purchasing during the recent several years
2565252 the fact that georgian peacemakers in the structure of joint peacemaking forces opened fire on their russian comrades from one and the same contingent speaks for itself i think
2565253 now it is clear to us why georgia never accepted russias offer to sign a legally binding document not to use force for the regulation of the south ossetian conflict
2565254 not so long ago before the military actions in south ossetia georgias president saakashvili said that there was no point in such a document because georgia would not use force against its people as he said it just so happens that it is using it
2565255 we have repeatedly warned that the international community should not turn a blind eye on massive purchases of offensive arms in which the georgian administration has been involved during the recent two years
2565256 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2565257 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2565258 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2565259 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2565260 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2565261 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2565262 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2565263 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2565264 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2565265 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2565266 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2565267 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2565268 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2565269 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2565270 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2565271 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2565272 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2565273 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2565274 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2565275 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2565276 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2565277 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2565278 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2565283 firstly there is the instrument itself we have the sound of an organ accompanied by a wolfs howl with a visual image of a flickering night sky overlaid with unintelligible archaic script the associations with both the silent era and films such as nosferatu and with the conventions of the hammer house of horror and horror in general are unmistakable the theme of btvs starts with this organ horror signifier but then instantly changes its message it removes itself from the sphere of 1960s and 70s horror by replaying the same motif the organ now supplanted by an aggressively strummed electric guitar relocating itself in modern youth culture relocating the series in an altogether different arena than that of both hammer and its spoofs
2565284 eurowebtainment has always been very supportive of asacp understanding that we are a non profit organization with a limited budget and therefore unable to attend every conference eurowebtainment organizers have consistently volunteered to represent asacp at events their support greatly helps us to educate people about asacp and the adult industrys efforts to protect children on an international level

2565305 reunions especially among employees of shuttered agencies are bright spots in what has been a gloomy period for our industry
2565306 they also put to the lie that agency folk are mostly shallow or opportunistic because there are connections spanning decades where the only payback is the satisfaction of staying in touch or renewing contacts with those you respect and like plus they are a blast
2565307 no way its absolutely impossible for us to do something like that
2565308 israel will almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months
2565309 we can not lose a single war the first war we lose israel will cease to exist
2565310 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
2565311 despite the apartheid state that has resulted from over half a century of bloody territorial conflicts with its neighboring palestinian territories few would deny that the state of israel is a democracy at the same time israel is a country founded upon an exclusivist jewish moral framework which offers all the worlds jews regardless of their nationality immediate citizenship providing them with a host of benefits and privileges over its non jewish citizens it is a country in which the orthodox rabbinical courts have jurisdiction over all matters relating to judaism including who is a jew where religious schools yeshivas are subsidized by the state and marriages are religious rather than civil affairs meaning no official will marry a jew to a non jew and the government is dominated by religious parties such as the ultra orthodox shas the yahadut hatorah and of course the ruling likud in short israel is in every sense of the term a jewish democracy
2565312 you have to wonder if there is some super weapon that could take care of this problem
2565313 reza aslan an iranian mullah tool who appears regularly on the msm to yap how dumb and terrible bush and the neocons are a smiley face pseudo intellectual creep
2565314 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
2565315 the trouble is that the usa may have the weaponry but israel does not
2565316 israel is in the best position militarily in its history to mount air strikes against iran after a decade of buying u
2565317 and then we walked up to an area that simple staffers and interns are not allowed the speakers gallery
2565318 and truth be told we took part in history as the house has never been held up in a sit in before and we were part of it
2565319 one is not enough but two is way too much
2565320 i would have taken you up on that but my phone was dead sorry
2565321 im sorry about that man i can tell by the way you look at her

2565324 its a story of courage of a very brave service dog taking care of me he passed away i was so depressed i had him cloned
2565325 that i would ski naked down mount everest in the nude with a carnation up my nose if he asked me to
2565326 i have been played up as a very wicked and perverted woman
2565327 she is a person of note in our little community
2565328 they can hear us thats what brings them they hear us talking and they are drawn to the sound like moths are drawn to the light
2565329 this is even more true of the husband holding a high image of his wife
2565330 there are so many people in our lives and we all want them to come to christ we as christians must do what we can and leave it to god we are to just plant the seed weather by word of mouth or by our lifestyle this is our way of being the light to the world so when are you going to turn on your light
2565331 just before the lok sabha election or the vidhan sabha election in five states the congress might direct the cbi to chargesheet me in the disproportionate assets da case and lodge me in jail the rival political parties might get me assassinated with the help of terrorists or naxalites in june 1995 the samajwadi party leaders had hatched a conspiracy to kill me in the state guest house but could not succeed
2565332 a person belonging to dalit community and chamar by caste would head the party in case she dies he is 18 to 20 years younger than me and does not belong to my family he is a devoted worker of the party and is being trained for the responsibility
2565333 at present i do not wish to reveal the name of my heir he would be in trouble as other aspirants for the top post might try to pull him down i have written his name on a letter pad and handed the document to two trusted lieutenants they would disclose the name at the appropriate moment
2565334 i am proud to have been born in a dalit household
2565335 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2565336 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2565337 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2565338 young people who grow up with freedom in one area of their lives will ultimately demand freedom in other areas
2565339 the china of the future will reflect its own culture and traditions but it will also reflect the universal aspirations of mankind and theres no deeper human desire than liberty
2565340 weve advanced both our nations interests by expanding free and fair trade and encouraging the rise of a chinese middle class which can be an enormous market for american exports
2565341 we have also cooperated on other shared challenges from fighting pandemic disease to opposing north koreas nuclear weapons programs
2565342 we have made it clear that trusting their people with greater freedom is necessary for china to reach its full potential
2565343 weve emphasized that being a global economic leader carries with it the duty to act responsibly on matters from energy to the environment to development in africa
2565344 i first visited the country more than three decades ago when my dad was americas representative in beijing
2565345 poverty was rampant and the streets swarmed with bicycles today china is sprinting into the modern era beijing is covered in skyscrapers and filled with cars and the people of china have more connections to the world than ever before
2565346 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2565347 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2565348 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2565349 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2565350 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2565351 but how was i to know which way the storyd go how was i to know youd break youd break my heart
2565352 you said youd love me until you die and as far as i know youre still alive
2565353 a life goes by romantic dreams must die so i kissed mine goodbye
2565354 how did this ever happen to a little old town like ours
2565355 did i ever think this would happen naw not in a million years this is beyond my imagination
2565356 if we can stabilize some of these costs we can provide good jobs for the future of these young people
2565357 he was backed by committee chairman councillor paula brookfield who said the investment would bring about a big improvement in the building and surrounding land
2565358 because the system is a tool that companies will use year after year we didnt want to put a time limit on the free projects for the beta test participants with so many organizations today working with remote employees telecommuters and international teams this system gives businesses and non profit organizations access to the tools they need to keep their projects on track
2565359 our goal is to introduce companies to what we call project management for the rest of us
2565360 pelotonics gives personal productivity fans like me the opportunity to increase the productivity of their teams as well
2565361 we searched the internet and found very few sites which were dedicated to interacting and supporting israels participation in the beijing china olympic games
2565362 all of the outgoing flights were canceled including ours we havent slept in two days please respect our wishes were tired and are asking the media to be discreet
2565363 everythings alright and we are up to date with everything thats going on
2565364 birds of all feathers come and sing together a hymn of hope in an olympic nest forget your borders ignore your cages and fly free reject your different nightmares and have one dream the same dream of glory of harmony of peace an equal dream for poor and rich black and white an equal right to compete and champion run and throw shoot and swim and pin row and hit you can be the best on our globe win dont kill lose dont hate hope dont regret go home with an olive branch in your lips together in harmony breathing fresh air and singing for the newly born in the cradles and the nests
2565365 normally heads of state only do television and newspaper interviews but on my list the sohu com appearance was the most important item
2565366 hopefully peres will find a few minutes to join the facebook room
2565367 safeguards are now in place that we believe would prevent this from recurring
2565368 there are insufficient safeguards on the agencys use of national security letters and other intrusive surveillance tools there arent enough controls inside the agency and there arent enough checks from outside the agency
2565369 especially dangerous is the fbis power to impose gag orders on those ordered to disclose information
2565370 these gag orders which are often unnecessary and almost always overbroad invite abuse

2565374 certainly his political career is in shambles its not going to come back i humanly feel sorry for mrs edwards i feel sorry for the edwards children but im not shocked
2565375 the fact that it is a mistake that many others have made before him did not make it any easier for me to hear when he told me what he had done
2565376 but he did tell me and we began a long and painful process in 2006 a process oddly made somewhat easier with my cancer diagnosis in march of 2007 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2565377 obviously lying like this brazenly is going to put an end probably to his political career and could affect whether he gets any role if barack obama were to win the presidency
2565378 i think the longer these allegations go unanswered and unresponded to the more difficult it is for the people producing the convention to give him a prominent spot
2565379 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2565380 my sense is that thats going to be their top priority
2565381 if he had been the nominee of the party now and this thing had blown up it would have it would have ruined the democrats chances of taking back the white house
2565382 my thoughts and prayer are with the edwards family today
2565383 the questions are going to be asked does this hurt republicans or democrats or the political impact and the truth is that its going to hurt everybody because right now in an uncertain world were looking to see who we can trust to lead the country and this lessens i think faith in political leadership in general
2565384 but keep in mind you know john edwards did not order that anyone be tortured he did not violate the geneva convention he did not forge a document to lead us into a war he cheated on his wife
2565385 wonder if youve seen this interesting idea with the tomato vine and upside down skillet
2565386 the canning process its not lower quality it creates different flavors and thats very important and its the flavor of good canned tomatoes that make up a naples pizza and indeed most pizza that we recognize
2565387 she looked up loden which is a shade of green and sloan is celtic for warrior
2565388 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
2565389 i read davids article and i thought he had some interesting things to say but ultimately im looking forward to gordon coming back from holiday refreshed batteries recharged and ready to carry on taking the decisions we need
2565390 whether there is anything else behind what david said i havent discussed with him but i think having said what he said its probably just as well that hes enjoying himself on holiday and that has allowed the rest of us to get on with the day to day stuff of politics and taking on the tories
2565391 we need to have the appetite for hand to hand combat we have to find our opportunity to debate in public with our opposite numbers and use our opportunities to be proud of what we are doing
2565392 we need to expose the tory lack of policy and lack of ambition
2565393 the transition from public sector to public service should be completed of course there are services where competition is inappropriate but where it can be applied it gives organisations a sharp reason to focus on delivering better services to users
2565394 that is why there should be a level playing field where public private and voluntary sectors are able to compete to be providers
2565395 they have this knack of hitting their best volleyball when it counts most and the pressures biggest
2565396 and even their worst is better than anyone elses best
2565397 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2565398 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2565399 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2565400 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2565401 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2565402 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2565403 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2565404 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2565405 fireworks shot off across the chinese capital as hundreds of drummers and dancers performed under a light display at the national stadium drawing applause from the estimated 90 000 in attendance
2565406 a facility that has a white membrane extended about 500 feet from the rafters of the stadium which was used to display multimedia images the chinese had over 15 000 performers and spent 10 times more money than did the greeks in athens
2565407 it was a stunning beginning from the nation of 1 3 billion people media observers said they believe the opening ceremony will be the single most watched television event in history
2565408 this one i think is going to be bigger and more spectacular not necessarily more surprising but more impressive i think than any previous ceremony
2565409 for the last forty years our thought has been trapped in hollow structures of language a stale dead but immensely successful rhetoric this has represented in my view a defeat of the intelligence and of the will

2565421 this is what i want to do for the rest of my life this is how i want to glorify serve and follow my god
2565422 but godliness has value for all things holding promise for both the present life and the life to come
2565423 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will save it
2565424 if i were with you i would rub your head

2565429 our objective in game 2 was to put a doubt in the minds of ginebra players
2565430 we didnt go out there to just win it ginebra was oozing with confidence and it was important to break that confidence
2565431 i asked my players to analyze it result for themselves and they didnt need to answer me

2565463 hak seseorang tidak akan terlaksana kecuali dengan melaksanakan kewajibannya begitu juga kewajiban seseorang tidak akan terlaksana kecuali dengan melaksanakan haknya
2565464 tidak mungkin seseorang memiliki hak atas allah akal kita sangat kerdil untuk membenarkan bahwa ada seseorang yang memiliki hak atas allah walaupun nabi terakhir sekalipun
2565465 kalaupun terdapat pihak yang haknya terlaksana namun dia tidak memiliki kewajiban atas yang lain maka itu hanya khusus untuk allah
2565466 merealisasikan hak tidak bisa sendirian tapi harus kerjasama dengan orang lain
2565467 hak adalah sesuatu yang sangat luas untuk disifati tapi sangat sempit untuk bisa dilaksanakan

2565487 im very concerned that global warming is aggravating the drought
2565488 the need to reduce water waste and efficiency is greater than ever before water efficiency is the wave of the future
2565489 we are very sensitive to the water issue but what were concerned with is the safety of the student athletes
2565490 i dont want to have to call a mother and say im sorry your daughter just tore her acl and will need rehab for one year
2565491 its hard for people to understand that were watering an artificial turf
2565492 i would find it a lot easier to believe that the university was serious about drought causing a water shortage if i didnt see them constantly watering the fields the astroturf fields
2565493 frankly our customers are not doing enough to save water period
2565494 this is not a drought buster rain by any stretch of the imagination but it is a start
2565495 weve done a poor job perhaps of explaining what that is
2565496 its in no way shape or form a goal or target its the threshold at which youll lose your service
2565497 these are all reasonable practical things that i dont think should hurt anyones quality of life and would save a lot of water when we need it to be saved
2565498 if water is being sprayed freely in the air its a violation
2565499 but were going to plan for the worst case scenario and just not take the risk of running out of water
2565500 i had been searching for a designer clothing line for my daughter that was unique and eco friendly when i didnt find it i figured why not make one of my own i want this line to highlight some of the fun aspects about living in a country as diverse as the us and teach children to celebrate the diversity
2565501 shoppers also buy organic because of freshness taste environmental concerns and an interest in supporting sustainable farming he writes
2565502 its hard to feel independent when someone is looking over your shoulder
2565503 it applies to corporate monocultures that we feel are not good stewards of the land
2565504 im really afraid that in the near future we wont be getting organic although its labeled that
2565505 theres nothing to stop a local farmer from using chemicals or abusing animals except the gaze or good word of his customers
2565506 instead of looking at labels the local food customer will look at the farm for himself or look the farmer in the eye and ask him how he grows his crops or treats his animals
2565507 fall the long running series of shorter days and cooler nights was canceled earlier this week after nearly 3 billion seasons on earth sources reported tuesday the classic period of the year which once occupied a coveted slot between summer and winter will be replaced by new stifling humidity levels near constant sunshine and almost no precipitation for months

2565512 the regulator said there was also evidence that introducing solids earlier limited a babys supply of vital breast milk and potentially harmed the kidneys the regulator said between the ages of four to six months human breast milk or infant formula was generally considered sufficient to meet the iron and zinc needs of infants
2565513 any solid food offerings from 4 to 6 months of age should not be considered nutrition if you or grandma choose to sneak in some solid food from 4 to 6 months of life view it as a treat in other words offer a taste or two of solid food when it is not feeding time
2565514 your baby is making progress in learning to eat solids by this time he is probably eating two meals each day of cereal made with breast milk or formula he may be taking in as much as 2 tablespoons at each feeding

2565520 did i ever think this would happen naw not in a million years this is beyond my imagination
2565521 if we can stabilize some of these costs we can provide good jobs for the future of these young people
2565522 in accordance with the ideals of the issues open source topic the acm has agreed to make the july issue of operating systems review
2565523 it was my mistake and i realised it i told him i am sorry so the matter is closed now relations between the two sides remain good
2565524 the batsmen were dominating and we were not doing well i was angry and when gambhir came through i just reacted and did the wrong thing in the heat of the moment but i regret it now
2565525 i play my cricket with lot of intensity and i was upset at my own bowling as well
2565526 we have received no such email threat from anywhere regarding any attack on the pakistani team during the eden test beginning november 30 2007 tv channels might have received such things but not kolkata police
2565527 we have only heard about the email we will take all pre emptive measures like beefing up security at the team hotel and at all entry points the pakistan team arrives as per schedule on tuesday
2565528 the cab has not been informed about this email so far
2565529 we have not been informed about this i really know nothing about it but on the basis of what we have heard from the press we have asked our internal security to be on alert
2565530 we have closed all the gates of cab and asked the contractor to identify his workers and the luggage they are carrying no goods are being allowed to be kept under the galleries
2565531 today the bowlers could not do well in the end and the batsmen took the responsibility
2565532 this is what we have been doing throughout this series
2565533 he can even smile although he has missed seven hundreds this year
2565534 there are many who retire even without scoring seven in their career
2565535 im getting into this wrong habit again and again but i feel very happy my innings has contributed to the teams victory
2565536 we lack in bowling and even today we gave away too many runs with the new ball
2565537 well these things happen what is most satisfying for me is that we won both the match and the series today
2565538 i guess i got into this wrong habit of getting out in the 90s but for me what matters and count most is that india won
2565539 they ran hard and played big shots as well full credit to them its important that the lower middle order chips in and they have been doing it consistently right throughout the series
2565540 initially the ball was not coming on to the bat and it was important to stay there and hit the ball in the right areas but it was very satisfying
2565541 its important for the team that he bats at number four and im at number five i want him to bat after the 20th overs right to the 50th over and score loads and loads of runs for us
2565542 they got a good start but still our bowlers managed to restrict them to 255 they bowled in the right areas and according to the field
2565543 i think we did not bowl well with the new ball we conceded just too many runs the score of 255 was quite defendable but we just conceded too many runs
2565544 as professionals we have to live with it it hurts but we are looking forward to the next match and the test series that follows
2565545 i think people love to see little aggression of this kind in one day cricket isnt it
2565546 i think at times aggression spills out after the incident i said sorry to gambhir but these incidents do take place there was nothing serious about it
2565547 is this the same side that was steam rollered by the aussies
2565548 we fenced together many times before so we knew each other quite well chinas bao yingying and tan xue knocked out of olympic womans
2565549 i was talking to a a guy who knows a junior head scout for the milwaukee brewers and he told him to tell me that prince fielder has the biggest waist hes ever seen in a baseball uniform
2565550 the way derek jeter turns the bat inside out and outside in it reminds me of the cirque du soleil hes the greatest at it ive seen
2565551 i have three children and i pay court ordered child support i was a truck driver but i lost most of the use of my right hand and havent made much money since im facing a 23 000 arrearage and they are trying to get more out of me
2565552 i now make 190 per week and just signed up for college to be able to get a decent job i tried to be a mortgage loan officer but the market has gone id like to apply for a job with a bank but in north carolina they will not license me because of the arrearage please help

2565554 the coup is a serious setback for mauritanians because it has robbed the people of their basic right to freely elect leaders of their own choice
2565555 we got guarantees that the parliament the democratic institutions the political parties and freedom will continue to exist
2565556 we will not release the deposed president at the time being for security reasons we are now trying to make calm prevail
2565557 the street seven oclock the horizon is a huge egg made of steel to whom shall i offer my innocent silence
2565558 i walk slowly that a jet fighter may not miss me the void opens its jaws but it doesnt swallow me i move aimlessly as if getting to know these streets for the first time and walking on them for the last time
2565559 we woke up from a coma to see a monocoloured flag of hamas do away with the four colour flag of palestine
2565560 gaza won its independence from the west bank one people now have two states two prisons who dont greet each other we are victims dressed in executioners clothing
2565561 we have triumphed knowing that it is the occupier who really won
2565562 we will not release the ousted president at the moment for security reasons we are trying now to establish calm and de escalate the situation
2565563 the former president is fine and in good health he has no problems there is a new authority the states supreme council which will look into the case of the president dossier after putting the countrys internal affairs in order this will take some time
2565564 it is difficult to give a set date for the presidential elections at the moment because we are addressing the priorities of the country and the needs of the people which were long ignored by the former president
2565565 however i have said all along if anyone is injured that i would look to the squad players now with their unions we cant control injuries
2565566 well make a decision as soon as we can and put players on standby
2565567 they did after all prove that theyre proud of the springbok jersey and that they wanted to win
2565568 we now know what we can do we didnt go onto the field with the all blacks in mind but we know what well have to take up for them
2565569 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2565570 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him
2565571 well have to bowl well tomorrow but theyre still behind with two key men out
2565572 i dont want them to worry about them to come back
2565573 it doesnt make any sense for us who work hard every day to make an honest living for some thug who lies around all day to come and take our stuff
2565574 we have got to be more visible ourselves and help our officers
2565575 try to protect ourselves and our belongings thats all we can do and pray that god gives us a solution
2565576 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
2565577 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
2565578 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
2565579 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
2565580 congress and some other parties have begun to think that they can benefit politically by promoting an anti hindu mindset and this is clearly evident in the recent developments in kashmir
2565581 a new trend of vote bank politics which thrives on exclusion of some community or the other
2565582 this anti hindu mindset and politics based on this mindset must be defeated we wholeheartedly support the courageous people of jammu
2565583 it is a very difficult yatra and people have to trek through a harsh tarrain dont people need basic amenities shouldnt considerations of their safety be addressed
2565584 what is kashmirs identity any way isnt kashmir an integral part of india
2565585 the congress leadership can easily buckle under the pressure of anti national forces and that in its perspective there is no place for the just demands and aspirations of the hindus let us not forget the people of jammu are agitating with the tricolour in their hands
2565586 this is not a struggle merely for 100 acres of land this is the struggle for the identity of our motherland it is a struggle of all patriotic people of india it is a struggle against politics of divisiveness and separatism
2565587 what do you think will happen if i take 23 ecsasy pills

2565595 i have a long history with new york that starts back with my days at twilo and the past five years we have developed a sort of clubbing history with central park
2565596 new york is always really special to me and i look forward to coming back every year
2565597 the entire political spectrum wants a solution which does not disturb the peace and stability of the country
2565598 we met 15 delegations talks will continue as only through a process of dialogue a solution acceptable to all parties can be agreed upon
2565599 we have presented our agenda to the delegation and our main demand that the land should be restored remains our agitation will continue
2565600 they just listened to our demand and no new fresh proposals were made
2565601 russian troops have fully liberated tskhinvali from the georgian military and have started pushing georgian units beyond the zone of peacekeepers responsibility
2565602 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2565603 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2565604 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2565605 we are tying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2565606 i see all the nations get together i am very upset about it i wish everybody would be at peace especially during the olympics
2565607 then the kings of the earth the nobles the military commanders the rich the powerful and every slave and free person will hid e in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains
2565608 fall on us and hide us from the face of the one seated on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb because the great day of their wrath has come and who is able to stand

2565610 were calling for an end to the chinese governments occupation in tibet
2565611 wed be gutted to lose here but we do have an opportunity to win
2565612 england looked vibrant and i do think our guys werent mentally in the same space as they were at the start of the series and thats understandable but its even stevens now with another one or two partnerships we can get up to or over 200 220 and put a lot of pressure on the england top five we feel we can defend that
2565613 hes improved over the last 12 months before he came here and what wed seen of him from when we did our homework hes become a much tighter player than last time he played against england
2565614 he got a beautiful ball from steve harmison to get rid of him in the first innings but what hes done so well is hes latched onto anything slightly loose and put it away for four he hits down the ground now as well as square so hes a pretty accomplished player
2565615 he obviously had a problem when he started but when i came in as coach he was always the one we identified to bat at 3 for us
2565616 we needed to give him a run and an opportunity
2565617 when we look back to where the planning started for a tour like this two years ago we needed hash to come into the tour with 20 tests under his belt hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him and hes going to be a quality player
2565618 hes so calm hes got a good head and hes pretty streetwise for a player his age

2565657 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2565658 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2565659 nothing will ever be attempted if all possible objections must first be overcome
2565660 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2565661 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2565662 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2565663 we believe the torch relay is clearly a force for good
2565664 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
2565665 we are confident that the games coming to china not only promote our economy but also enhance all social conditions including education health and human rights
2565666 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2565667 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2565668 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2565680 as president alan evans must accept responsibility for the groups failure to publicly disclose on time how much money the organisation donated to the labor and coalition parties mr evans should explain if the group made a mistake or if there was an attempt to cover up the 225 000 in donations either way the law has been broken and alan evans needs to accept responsibility
2565681 we have an obligation to be involved in the political process in order to advance the interests of our members
2565682 it is important to note that we do not donate money to political parties instead we purchase tables at political functions and events that are attended by members of parliament at both a state and federal level
2565683 internally we have a set of rules that govern this process namely that what we give to one side of politics we give to another in order to ensure fairness and that we only attend those events at which there are representatives from the areas of relevance to our members
2565684 unfortunately this is a reality of being involved in the political process today
2565685 money given at fundraisers flows into the coffers of the major parties and buys influence just like direct donations what mr evans is admitting to is the potential money brings to bend the ears of mps at swanky fund raising events who knows whether nrma members are happy with their money being handed over by alan evans to political parties
2565686 the nrma has no reason to not disclose its political contributions and took steps to ensure its obligation was met

2565730 lolita came from puget sound so it is ridiculous for anyone to postulate that she cannot survive in these waters eighty seven of her closest relatives still live in these waters whales and dolphins have been shipped around the world as a matter of routine lolita has earned a fortune for her captors and owners and has reached a time in her life when she is at greater risk of her facility crumbling around her than she would be in a seapen in the san juan islands her kind has been trained to do open water exercise and missions and she no doubt can do likewise here in her homewaters lolita can have the same or better quality of food and care that she now receives i think it is unconscionable that an animal that in nature swims 75 miles per day within a range of hundreds to thousands of miles should be subjected to a lifetime of floating in a bathtub size pool it is directly analogous to locking a child in a closet for its lifetime

2565778 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
2565779 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2565780 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2565781 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2565782 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2565783 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2565784 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
2565785 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
2565786 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
2565787 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2565788 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
2565789 i think every single candidate for president republican and democratic have lives personal lives that indicate something about what kind of human being they are and i think it is a fair evaluation for america to engage in to look at what kind of human beings each of us are and what kind of president wed make
2565790 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

2565818 we are pleased that in two separate patent cases in front of two different itc judges broadcom has prevailed at trial with rulings that support our position that sirf infringes our intellectual property but that we do not infringe theirs

2565821 without that youre not putting yourself in a strong position to respond more safely
2565822 we strongly suspect that wearing earphones will present a safety challenge to drivers in particular situations but there needs to be that evidence in place before legislative initiatives are considered
2565823 that tends to immediately cut you off from the acoustic world around you
2565824 we are willing to do ceasefire immediately provide the other side stops to shoot and to bomb
2565825 and we are willing to disengage disengage immediately and as soon as they stop shoot ing at us were willing to take any steps first steps required for us
2565826 we urge the georgian authorities to immediately stop their aggression against south ossetia to stop all violations of all standing agreements on a ceasefire and to respect the legal rights and interests of other people
2565827 the response has been far disproportionate from whatever threat russia was citing
2565828 we are calling for an immediate ceasefire and a stand down of all troops
2565829 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2565830 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2565831 to urgently convene a meeting of the european council at the level of heads of government
2565832 the territorial integrity of georgia is currently being violated on an enormous scale
2565833 there are bombardments civilians are dying foreign military forces are on georgian territory
2565834 the eu and nato must take the initiative and stand up against the spread of imperialist and revisionist policy in the east of europe
2565835 the russian federation has overstepped a red line in keeping the peace and stability in the conflict zone and in protecting russian citizens outside its own borders
2565836 in this sense it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action
2565837 the death toll is likely to increase because heavy rain is still falling and the rivers in the area are rising
2565838 the water and walls of mud came at night when everybody was sleeping
2565839 sure i am delighted with the result but there is a lot more to come from this group of players
2565840 when they scored we got a foot hold on the match and i was pleased with the character of the lads
2565841 that was the reaction i was looking for and knowing the lads as i do i never had any doubt that would be their response
2565842 he needs to learn the shape and the system but it was a great debut from him
2565843 he was our penalty taker in the absence of the injured martin rowlands and practiced yesterday
2565844 he scored five out of five in training and ill have no problems with him taking another for us
2565845 this victory is a small step on a long road its a long season and were one out of one on a 46 game ladder
2565846 we had a fantastic start to the game with a great finish by iain hume we could have had another one or two we were very pleased with what we saw today
2565847 we had a bad five minutes and conceded twice from set pieces which was disappointing you have to give credit to qpr because they did well in those five minutes although the first one came from a very dubious free kick
2565848 there was only one team in it in the second half we took the game to them and there was only one side out there there was nothing in it we have come here and had the lions share of the play we were the better team
2565849 we have not won the game which is very disappointing for everybody but there were a lot of positives we are obviously disappointed with the result but we can take a lot from that performance
2565850 it was never a penalty but luke steele saved it anyway i have no complaints though about the sending off
2565851 it always surprises me when people dont want to be positive and instead write negative stories im a positive person
2565852 we have high profile owners here and the tag of favourites is going to stay but we have to embrace that and tackle it head on
2565853 barnsley played well and defensively we were too open we were a little bit too gung ho
2565854 but in the end we got a win out of a potentially difficult situation it says a lot about the character of the team
2565855 we got the job done without being great im not going to pretend otherwise its a result were delighted with without getting carried away
2565856 its a small step on a long road for us its the first rung on a 46 rung ladder
2565857 we had a fantastic start iain hume finished well and we could maybe have scored one or two more
2565858 in the second half there was only one team in it we took the game to them qpr have spent a lot of money and i felt we not only had the lions share we were actually the better side
2565859 im disappointed with the result but in terms of the performance there were good things to come out of it and well take that and move on
2565860 were a stronger squad than we were last season and we will be a better team
2565861 theres always pressure when you sign a striker for over 1million and theres pressure on iain hume so it was good to see him score
2565862 people have raised eyebrows about spending more than a million pounds on a player so i was delighted for iain
2565863 it is disappointing overall though as we were the better team throughout
2565864 we have to tried everyone with the same respect whether we go to sheffield united or swindon i know people are referring to us as the chelsea of the championship which i dont believe as we are doing it in a more structured way but thats what were up against

2565868 were more susceptible to an offer but so far we havent had one and i hope that continues

2565870 i have no country to fight for my country is the earth and i am a citizen of the world
2565871 we dont know the answer to that question thats why were here
2565872 as it dropped off the bridge rail the bus rolled to the right where it came to rest
2565873 certain irregularities about whether the bus was operating under the name angel tours or iguala busmex it is important to note that neither of these domestic entities is authorized to operate as a u s passenger carrier in interstate commerce at this time
2565874 as being a high risk carrier due to safety violations detected during roadside safety inspections and was subjected to an fmcsa compliance review in may 2008
2565875 this review resulted in fmcsa placing angel tours operations out of service
2565876 to date angel tours has not provided the agency with evidence of satisfactory corrective actions to the problems discovered and remains out of service
2565877 fmcsa has not granted iguala busmex authority to transport passengers because it has failed to fully comply with federal safety requirements
2565878 and as soon as we passed dallas we were on the two way freeway and i feel the bus ride a little bit fast and i have a feeling not a safe feeling
2565879 i feel a little bit shaky but i just let myself at peace and then go to sleep
2565880 as i opened my eyes i see the chair falling off and i was sitting right below the tv and i felt that somebody was laying on my leg and then right next to me there was a lady she got her arm really crushed up and on top of her there was another lady she cannot move

2565901 it may have delayed her eventual demise probably slow the cancer down but eventually she would have succumbed to this vicious cancer
2565902 the point here is that the primary tumor was treated
2565903 the bottom line is it probably does happen obviously it happens very rarely because it is the nature of cancer to grow not to regress
2565904 for the true believer or faithful this is a miracle for the true skeptic this is a random or very unusual coincidence for the doctor and scientist we call it complete spontaneous regression of cancer
2565905 im not the praying type but i just wanted to say thank you
2565906 when you try to combat everything at the end of the day you realize that youre responsible for yourself look at the attention i get its because i throw a football but thats what society values thats not what god values he didnt invent the game we did i have some eye hand coordination and i can throw the ball i dont think that matters to god

2565913 just recently weve learned again that the white house was involved in trying to ocook the books at the cia to try to create a phony link between al qaeda and saddam hussein we cannot let this pass we cannot let it slide we cannot stand by and watch the destruction of our constitution even as this president is on his way out the door there has to be accountability which is why this effort is continuing make no mistake about it the effort towards accountability is not going to cease as we approach an election its not going to stop once the elections over and its not going to stop when a new president is sworn in the bush administration must be held accountable for the crimes they have committed

2565921 the chief called and told me that me and my family had been absolutely and completely cleared of any charges
2565922 he also said that he did not apologize for any action or wrongdoing by the police department although he did express regret about what has happened

2565928 as a result of the barbarous actions planned in advance and carried out by the georgian leadership there have been many casualties in the thousands tens of thousands of refugees and massive violations of the right to life of an entire people
2565929 russia is being guided in this situation by only one thing
2565930 the task of immediately stopping the violence protecting the civilian population and the rapid restoration of peace

2565936 the amount being paid to the music industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content we own and control is far too small

2565939 the yakima valley is a huge player these are big operations that are difficult to track down
2565940 they use fictitious names they put property in daughters wives names to conceal identity and try to thwart law enforcement from going forward with civil forfeiture

2565943 monitoring is the right thing to do in these circumstances
2565944 the dark side the inside story of how the war on terror turned into a war on american ideals
2565945 the legal doctrine that addington espoused that the president as commander in chief had the authority to disregard virtually all previously known legal boundaries if national security demanded it rested on a reading of the constitution that few legal scholars shared
2565946 torture always worked it saved america on a weekly basis
2565947 in conversation with british human rights lawyer philippe sands the top military lawyer in guant namo diane beaver said quite earnestly that jack bauer gave people lots of ideas as they sought for interrogation models
2565948 after reviewing 517 of the guant namo detainees cases in depth
2565949 they concluded that only 8 percent were alleged to have associated with al qaeda fifty five percent were not alleged to have engaged in any hostile act against the united states at all and the remainder were charged with dubious wrongdoing including having tried to flee u s bombs the overwhelming majority all but 5 percent had been captured by non u s players many of whom were bounty hunters

2566016 los miembros de la comunidad a trav s del patronato han solicitado ayuda en reiteradas ocasiones pero hasta la fecha no han tenido ninguna respuesta favorable
2566017 las autoridades municipales nos han prometido que en esta administraci n el problema quedar solucionado por lo que estamos a la espera de que eso sea una realidad
2566018 we have unrealistic expectations for people john edwards like the rest of us is only human
2566019 the truth is a lot of ordinary average americans have affairs
2566020 weve got one of the ablest candidates ever nominated and hes running against a man who really pretty much promises more of the same of what weve had the last eight years
2566021 i think its entirely up to senator edwards and his wife and the rest of us should keep quiet
2566022 the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2566023 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2566024 many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention
2566025 obviously a lot of people believed in john edwards people were passionate about his candidacy i think there are people who feel let down when you invest that much time and energy in a candidate and the candidate turns out to be less than you thought
2566026 the american public has become sensitized to this type of behavior from political leaders
2566027 our staff put their faith and confidence in him and he let them down
2566028 i think he has gotten the justice department back on a footing of integrity
2566029 i dont want to use the word disappointed but he hasnt provided the balance that i had hoped for
2566030 is making sure there are no scandals or even appearance of scandals and thats a core task in this day and age
2566031 he took a department that was deeply troubled with antagonism and dysfunction and he put it back together
2566032 he and his deputies are leaving the u s attorneys alone with lots of leeway and lots of independence
2566033 and that disappoints me its like saying im going to be a place holder and this is a man who certainly has the ability to be something more than a place holder he doesnt want to rock the boat
2566034 continue to do what i can to ensure that politics is kept out of decisions
2566035 i think he was determined to sustain the administrations position
2566036 mukasey thinks the world of bradbury and has really pushed and promoted steve
2566037 they could have thrown steve overboard and put someone else in that would have been the easy thing to do but they didnt
2566038 if he was truly independent he would say enoughs enough and get rid of him
2566039 the hope was that he would come in and clean up shop and make a break with his predecessors
2566040 the fact that he is not willing to open investigations into everything the democrats want should not be particularly surprising
2566041 where you sit is where you stand hes not a judge anymore hes the attorney general of the united states hes defending the presidents prerogatives

2566114 the proposed fisa deal is not a compromise it is a capitulation the house and senate should not be taking up this bill which effectively guarantees immunity for telecom companies alleged to have participated in the presidents illegal program and which fails to protect the privacy of law abiding americans at home allowing courts to review the question of immunity is meaningless when the same legislation essentially requires the court to grant immunity and under this bill the government can still sweep up and keep the international communications of innocent americans in the u s with no connection to suspected terrorists with very few safeguards to protect against abuse of this power instead of cutting bad deals on both fisa and funding for the war in iraq democrats should be standing up to the flawed and dangerous policies of this administration

2566133 i appreciate a man who stands tall for making sure every child is educated and no child is left behind
2566134 i think parents have a right to know whether kids are learning
2566135 i fundamentally believe that parents have a right to know whether their kids are learning
2566136 we have for too long let kids go through a system without regard to whether theyre learning
2566137 schools have the resources they need to teach our kids
2566138 one of my most important responsibilities as s senator is to ensure that our schools have the resources they need to teach our kids this kind of cut is unacceptable to me
2566139 wellstone said the country has to choose between education funding or tax cuts for the rich republican norm coleman who is challenging wellstone for senate this year called that a false choice he said he didnt think any of the tax cuts should be rolled back
2566140 by dancing around the question of whether or not he would have supported the farm bill brian davis showed that he either hasnt taken the time to learn about the issue or doesnt think its important in congress you have to make the tough decisions and vote minnesotans deserve to know would brian davis have supported the farm bill yes or no once again and as with so many other issues brian davis has demonstrated that he is not ready to serve minnesota in congress
2566141 today were flooded with information its an information overload and were not capable of handling it

2566153 the number of our troops in afghanistan is only going up and so we want to make sure that as were growing that we have the most efficient and effective command structure in place
2566154 the main additional responsibility he gen mckiernan is assuming is for the training mission emphasis added which is just an essential mission for the afghans and for us
2566155 the sooner they are a capable fighting force and can assume responsibility for protecting their own people and their borders the sooner us forces and the worlds forces can come out
2566156 i was expecting if you like a more conventional correction that followed the patterns of a straightforward downturn this has clearly been far more than that weve seen massive disruptions of the financial markets particularly liquidity problems which were not anticipated

2566190 we need to make the oath something that people are offered rather than required to take we should make provision for republicans or separatists i wouldnt drop the oath i would make it optional i am a subject of the queen even more than i am a citizen of this country id much prefer a bad monarchy to a good president but people ought to be able to come to parliament and argue that they dont want the monarchy
2566191 the fact that a silly group of people at the beginning of the 21st century think they know better seems to me to be a very dodgy proposition
2566192 the queen is the centre of the british constitution to remove her from the parliamentary oath taken by members of parliament is a covert attempt to republicanise our constitution
2566193 mps should be free to choose an oath of allegiance

2566230 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2566231 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2566232 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2566233 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2566234 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2566235 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2566236 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2566237 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2566240 arguably we are on the verge of a last great global land grab
2566241 it will mean more deforestation more conflict more carbon emissions more climate change and less prosperity for everyone
2566242 if the current plateau in productivity continues the amount of additional agricultural land required just to meet the worlds projected food demand in 2050 would be about three billion hectares nearly all of which would be required in developing countries
2566243 these new studies should strengthen global resolve to protect the property rights of indigenous and local communities who play a vital role in protecting one the most outstanding natural wonders of the world
2566244 it is clear that the dual crises of fuel and food are attracting significant new investments and great land speculation
2566245 only by protecting the rights of the people who live in and around the worlds most vulnerable forests can we prevent the devastation these forces will wreak on the poor

2566296 no state has the right to intervene militarily in the territory of another state simply because there are individuals there with a passport issued by that state or who are nationals of the state
2566297 attempts to apply such a doctrine have plunged europe into war in the past and we have reason to remember how hitler used this very doctrine little more than half a century ago to undermine and attack substantial parts of central europe
2566298 there must be a very strong response on the part of the european union
2566299 it takes the night to clear all of this mess away
2566300 well thats not the way i would do it but i suppose it is still a good way

2566303 this work helps connect our psychological understanding of why we like some things and not others with the genetic mechanisms that define our range of behaviors
2566304 in the ongoing discussion about how much the environment versus genetics determine behavior this study points to how the interaction between these factors influences our judgment and decision making
2566305 we were surprised to see that variation in the creb1 gene would account for more than 20 percent of the difference in how healthy participants weighed different options and expressed specific preferences
2566306 our previous studies and the work of other groups suggested that variation in this gene could be important for judgment and decision making by the brain but we needed to connect this to a measurable decision making effect in both behavior and brain activity
2566307 this study connects quantitative measurements across three levels of observation brain activity genomic variation and the expression of preference we now are investigating the potential role of other genes and will go on to assess how this relationship across three levels of observation may be affected by conditions such as depression and addiction

2566360 this new generation of learners is smart but impatient creative expecting results immediately customizing the things they choose very focused on themselves
2566361 for the first time in history children are more comfortable knowledgeable and literate than their parents about an innovation central to society and it is through the use of the digital media that the n generation will develop and superimpose its culture on the rest of society boomers stand back already these kids are learning playing communicating working and creating communites very differently than their parents they are a force for social transformation
2566362 they accept little at face value unlike the tv generation which had no viable means to interact with media content the n generation has the tools to challenge ideas people statements anything these youth love to argue and debate they are also learning to think critically as well
2566363 over the next decade the millenial generation will entirely recast the image of youth from downbeat and alienated to upbeat and engaged with potentially seismic consequences for america
2566364 beginning to manifest a wide array of positive social habits that older americans no longer associate with youth including a new focus on teamwork achievement modesty and good conduct look closely at the dramatic changes now unfolding in the attitudes and behaviors of todays youth the 18 and unders of the year 2000 the evidence is overwhelming and just starting to attract notice
2566365 the fact that youngsters like to multitask and that they can do it better than oldsters says little about well they learn while multitasking and the research says otherwise
2566366 prenskys interpretations are speculative extrapolations from research findings that the brain continues to adapt and is malleable and that people think differently according to their experiences
2566367 the title of the blog net gen nonsense doesnt exactly endear itself to potential readers expecting a considered view but the authors promise to attempt to place e learning in a broad educational context and establish principle of consistency and contingency in theory is at least worth a look
2566368 given the evidence the matter of addressing the digital divide within the so called net gen is at least as important if not more so than any imperative to blindly adapt to the technological orientation that is said to define them
2566369 i really do think there are many conversations about innovations in education in the edublogosphere that are not scrutinized to the extent they should be
2566370 the structure governance power relationships and cultural values of the traditional campus efforts to transform higher education face deeply entrenched cultural behavioral and philosophical resistance
2566371 the arrival of the net generation on campus is causing unrest in the classroom 1 a wave of young people empowered to create knowledge not merely absorb it now flows in and out of the classroom calling into question the convictions and processes that have served as the foundation of traditional higher education it remains to be seen whether traditional higher education will adjust sufficiently to truly engage the net generation

2566376 the food here is awful no fruit vegetables are moldy only meat canned food and soda what do kids eat the guy at the store told me no one would eat fruit unless its in a can is that true
2566377 when we get back to new york i will talk with you about diet and quality of food availability in poor neighborhoods
2566378 all i see are liquor stores and dollar stores and fast food there was one guy who said hed buy my food stamps 50 cents for a dollar in stamps how can people live like this
2566379 see fruit is expensive raw food is too much for low income people and we dont always have a fridge so you got to keep things in cans that way it can move with you and one thing you need to know low income people always are on the move not just squatters all low income folks
2566380 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy

2566430 like yung una namin was yung abandoned hospital sa clark air base may nakunan kaming footage
2566431 isa isa silang pumapasok doon sa lugar tapos meron kaming ipinapagawa sa kanila pero walang ibang tao doon may ten cameras na naka set up walang cameraman doon sa mga camera simple lang yung mga challenges pero mahirap doon nakakatakot yung lugar e
2566432 paiba iba minsan may mga set na ano minsan may mga pares minsan individual lahat yun nakasuot sila ng helmet na may kamera tapos walang ilaw doon sa lugar kandila lang at saka flashlight yung gamit
2566433 walang nananakot pero may nangyayari lagi na nakakatakot its either may nakikita silang dumadaan akala nila tinatakot sila may umuungol akala nila tinatakot sila pero walang tao doon
2566434 ah hindi masyado okey lang nakakaramdam ako pero pumipikit ako e
2566435 no hindi ako exposed doon sa remote na area nila e studio lang ako ako lang yung nagde deliver ng gap ako lang yung nag e explain
2566436 hindi ko nga alam e actually kahapon lang narinig ko lumalabas labas
2566437 hindi ko ma pinpoint e actually gusto kong marinig o makita o yung mabasa nag check ako sa pep kahapon wala naman akong nabasa
2566438 were still together pero hindi ko talaga akam kung bakit may tsismis na ganyan hindi ko maintinidhan
2566439 actually ano yung oras namin sobra akong busy busy din siya
2566440 kapag may libreng oras nagde date pa rin kami yung usual ano namin e dinner palagi kaming ganun
2566441 hindi naman pero siyempre minsan may mga petty quarrels nagtataka lang ako kung bakit may lumalabas
2566442 not at all siguro naiisip mo rin masyadong tahimik masyado kaming tahimik
2566443 wala naman akong magagawa e ano ang magagawa ko pero sa akin for the record were still together wala kaming problema at siyempre walang ibang chicks
2566444 alam mo yun ang nakakatawa its either hiwalay yung tinatanong or ikakasal di ba parang wala pa naman wala pa namang plano
2566445 hindi were together and were going out pero hindi live in walang balak
2566446 yeah nagla lunch kami minsan nagdi dinner tapos yung panganay si robin im trying to train him now e sa gym meron akong inaayos na program for him kasi eventually parang ilu launch na siya e as performer artist parang ilu launch na rin siya as a singer

2566450 my dad taught me how to sail when i was four
2566451 he took me out in a little boat and after a while i said okay i can do it by myself now
2566452 while i was in hospital my dad went out and bought me a new boat
2566453 he said its a really good buy and i know you cant sail now but i just want to entice you to do everything you can
2566454 and i guess all that thinking about it actually got me there
2566455 there wasnt ever really any hesitation in my mind that he wouldnt ever be able to sail
2566456 from the time we started talking about it it was always presumed hed be able to do it
2566457 everyone whos at the olympics has the best equipment has done their boat handling preparation and they all have the skills to win its those who can deal with the pressure each situation and trying to work it out in their mind the communication between the crew and coach and having been through such an ordeal having a lot of time to think about it hopefully i feel should help me

2566492 the au will suspend mauritanias membership until the country returns to constitutional government
2566493 he also said he would organise a presidential election within a short period of time
2566494 the coup is a serious setback for mauritanians because it has robbed the people of their basic right to freely elect leaders of their own choice
2566495 return to constitutional order and the re establishment without delay of the institutions that the mauritanian people have democratically chosen
2566496 told me he was in good health well treated in good conditions
2566497 we will not release the overthrown president for the moment for security reasons we are trying to re establish calm and to lower tensions
2566498 we came to power accidentally but only to serve the country
2566499 i urge all mauritanians to overcome their differences to help us tackle the threats facing the country such as hunger ignorance and sickness
2566500 its the only way to describe it if he hit in the other side of my head i dont think it would have happened but he hit me on the same side i hurt in new york
2566501 i think its a different kind of injury because you know you can go out and play and feel normal
2566502 they told me theres 10 days where you can reinjure it i think at this point in the season theyre being extremely cautious not to put myself in a situation where i could get a third one
2566503 the fact that it happened again they just want to make sure everything checks out
2566504 so theres a concern there that if it happened again right now he could be out for a long time
2566505 he can play all three outfield positions along with the middle infield so with izzys thumb still progressing it gives us a guy whos multidimensional
2566506 i didnt find out i was coming back until around midnight last night i had to go to the field in salt lake this morning and pick up my baseball stuff before i got my flight so its been a little hectic but im really happy to be here this is where i want to be i had a great time when i was up here last time
2566507 appears to stand in direct contrast to the recent indication that there are no plans to close the church
2566508 bishop brian noble has expressed his gratitude to the diocese of chester for its willingness to share the church of all saints
2566509 the congregation must evince a certain surprise at this suggestion
2566510 if this were to be so it would also naturally be of concern to this congregation
2566511 i think free agency now is becoming a global thing when players become free agents the team theyre currently with their competition is no longer the rest of the teams in the nba but its global so the markets opened up so well just have to see how the league responds to it
2566512 if someone wants to throw 50 million on the table for me
2566513 defense is something ive had to work so hard on
2566514 thats where i was lacking earlier in my career and ive focused more on defense than offense
2566515 some guys like shortstops orlando cabrera erick aybar and maicer izturis are born with a glove for me it wasnt like hitting something i had the ability to do nobody really taught me the fundamentals of defense until i got in pro ball
2566516 from where he was four years ago its night and day with howie
2566517 hes really turning the double play well his range is terrific hes playing a very high level second base
2566518 of all our infielders i think howie has improved the most
2566519 you can help your team out defensively and running the bases even if youre not having a good night with the bat ive put in a lot of work with alfredo griffin and with our shortstops
2566520 orlando cabrera helped me a lot hed tell me how to take an extra step back on some balls to get a better look at the ball ive watched how guys do things and put that into my game when i heard that mark ellis of the as said he did everything on the field in batting practice with a purpose i started doing that too
2566521 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2566522 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2566523 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2566524 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2566525 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2566526 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2566527 en als u er dan toch echt iets voor wilt geven brengt u ons komende zomer maar eens een maaltje boontjes langs of zo
2566528 i was really dehydrated from our ride on sat i barely could stand up in the shower had to lean on
2566529 this has been totally driven by their city administrator and their mayor
2566530 however any obligations that do not produce a revenue benefit for the city of camas will be recommended for immediate elimination or reduction we will respond to life threatening mutual aid calls as long as it doesnt not come at the cost of our own communities public heath and welfare
2566531 camas may want to stop assisting on some of our emergency calls but washougal will always help camas if asked thats just the way we do things
2566532 i stay focused on my highest priorities and dont worry about what isnt getting done since its not my highest priority
2566533 i relieve my stress by exercising every morning i also make sure my assistant schedules me in a hotel with an excellent fitness center when im on the road i stayed at a westin last week that had a treadmill in the room
2566534 spending time with my family including weekends at our second home on the lake helps me unwind its good to be in a different environment away from the everyday hustle and bustle

2566541 russia in recent years has also granted citizenship to the separatists
2566542 protect the lives and dignity of russian citizens no matter where they are located
2566543 in any case the time to deal with this conflict is not now but was two or even four years ago for a very long time it has been clear that there was a security vacuum in the caucasus that this vacuum was dangerous that war was likely that georgia an eager ally of the united states would not emerge well from a confrontation and that a successful invasion of georgia a country with u s troops on its soil would reflect badly on the west cowardice weakness lack of ideas and above all the distraction of other events prevented any deeper engagement and now it may be too late
2566544 to abandon georgia and its fragile democratic rose revolution would send a terrible signal to other former soviet and warsaw pact republics that to moscows dismay have achieved or are working toward democracy and fully independent foreign policies the west has made that sort of mistake before and must not do so again

2566591 what i think bishop mcmahons heartwarming speech did most of all was to convey to those gathered that he was not simply there as a token prelate but that he really enjoyed taking part actively that he supported our work and that he was prepared to crack some jokes that he knew we would enjoy being entirely on our wavelength and as they say reading from the same page

2566705 i am not in it for the spotlight or attention i am just trying to help other people
2566706 it gives you peace of mind and that happiness that confidence that the team has confidence in you
2566707 i wanted to try to get this thing behind me so i could focus more on the season
2566708 it will appear as a six year deal but theres a lot of situations where it could end up being as short as three
2566709 it could be four it could be five and it could be six everything ive ever seen in a contract is in this deal
2566710 as ive said many times i believe brian westbrook is the best running back in football
2566711 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking he is true professional and leader on and off the field and its a great deal for both brian and the eagles organization id like to give credit to joe banner todd france and brian for working so diligently in getting this deal done we look forward to brian having a great 2008 season and beyond
2566712 all of us wanted to get the deal done quickly but there was never a threat of what the would do if it wasnt
2566713 what hes done over the last few weeks with this going on and still working i mean he came out when he had strep throat and he practiced he just wants to win so badly and he wants the team to be the best it can be and thats whats always driven him
2566714 you take somebody with that kind of talent and those kind of intangibles that they bring to your team that is the guy you want to make sure is feeling good about things if you possibly can
2566715 it would probably end up being three or four years
2566716 i think its the most complicated contract ive ever seen
2566717 its rough to have ridges living with ice ridges on your shoreline

2566720 if l a fell off the map i wouldnt miss it
2566721 the movie is full of all kinds of venom and frustration with the city
2566722 its not only the black and white cinematography but the whole way we shot the movie was more like a 1950s hollywood film every one of the shots is motivated by the exact same reasons that billy wilder would have had in mind making double indemnity or sunset boulevard not that im at that level yet we were looking at classic cinematographers like gordon willis as our model
2566723 we didnt want to do that faux documentary thing where you find the story in editing
2566724 we wanted to work with the old fashioned language of film
2566725 trumbos story feels very timely i first discovered this material before 9 11 before we had the patriot act or john ashcroft and his list we now have the dubious distinction of releasing this film during a period in american history where the issues trumbo faced really resonate with people his patriotism was questioned but you see from the letters that he fought in world war ii growing up in the depression he had this incredible range of american experience
2566726 for trumbo it was all about being loyal as a friend he would have been happy to take you around the corner to a bar for a drink and tell you yeah i joined the communist party not once but twice but to be forced to say that and worse to be asked what his friends politics were trumbo believed in the constitution and the first amendment and he never changed those beliefs to suit other peoples needs
2566727 invariably theres a price to pay one could argue that maybe trumbo wasnt being the most considerate father or husband but he had this stubborn contrarian personality and he loved to fight

2566734 what a sweet face on this little girl those little
2566735 christians dont share tolerance as a core value increasingly we are falling into a situation where we are adopting this doctrine of tolerance which is falling well short of where christ wants us
2566736 anglicanism is going to survive but differently the gafcon group because of demographics and growth is going to become anglicanism
2566737 theres good in that but problems as well it would be better if the moderates would align with the orthodox conservative wing of the church but anglicanism is by definition a broad church
2566738 i dont think a formal split is occurring i do think the global south is going to continue on its way and the rest of the church will have to show it is ready to align with it
2566739 abandoning the communion of this church does not mean we abandon a person as a member of the body of christ
2566740 as a matter of fact i havent heard anything from her or any of her friends nonetheless i have not had any kind of disparaging conversation about her with anybody i have not even spoken ill against the two bishops who brought charges against me i have just let it go because i know where my faith is and i have stated that

2566749 one can only wonder at the motives behind releasing and highlighting these letters at this precise moment and at the way in which some churchmen are seeking to make capital of them as though they were news

2566975 in the 1960s a mafia don was only as strong as his family
2566976 we found the hierarchical culture of organized crime intriguing running an organized crime family in a world defined by family loyalty is something that we felt could introduce a new strategic element to the genre that is what the dons view is all about laying out a strategy to pick off the competition one by one the dons view is so unique it could fundamentally change the rules of open world games by blending action and strategy to create something entirely new

2566979 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2566980 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2566981 he was just so alive i cant believe hes gone
2566982 it was such a popular show because of his bigger than life persona
2566983 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2566984 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you

2566987 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2566988 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977
2566989 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
2566990 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2566991 oppression of tibetans by the illegal communist regime in tibet
2566992 an isaf soldier died in southern afghanistan august 9 after an attack from insurgents
2566993 as president alan evans must accept responsibility for the groups failure to publicly disclose on time how much money the organisation donated to the labor and coalition parties mr evans should explain if the group made a mistake or if there was an attempt to cover up the 225 000 in donations either way the law has been broken and alan evans needs to accept responsibility
2566994 we have an obligation to be involved in the political process in order to advance the interests of our members
2566995 it is important to note that we do not donate money to political parties instead we purchase tables at political functions and events that are attended by members of parliament at both a state and federal level
2566996 internally we have a set of rules that govern this process namely that what we give to one side of politics we give to another in order to ensure fairness and that we only attend those events at which there are representatives from the areas of relevance to our members
2566997 unfortunately this is a reality of being involved in the political process today
2566998 money given at fundraisers flows into the coffers of the major parties and buys influence just like direct donations what mr evans is admitting to is the potential money brings to bend the ears of mps at swanky fund raising events who knows whether nrma members are happy with their money being handed over by alan evans to political parties
2566999 the nrma has no reason to not disclose its political contributions and took steps to ensure its obligation was met
2567000 all nrma donations as defined by the state electoral funding authority have now been disclosed and the amount is listed on the efa website penalties are a matter for the authority
2567001 i dont think that dissolving parliament would be the best option for him no one in the country would support the action
2567002 he is left with two options either to face the impeachment motion like a man or resign and go home quietly
2567003 our request for the convening of the national assembly session on monday has been accepted and in this session we will be moving a resolution to start the impeachment process
2567004 there are around 16 to 17 pml q members in the national assembly who will vote against the president
2567005 around seven to eight will be such people in the senate
2567006 i think im the luckiest one out of most people
2567007 god called them home and he called them at a good time
2567008 if there is a loss of pressure or the tyre becomes delaminated its much more difficult to control the vehicle
2567009 we are here with them to pray for those who are lost and for gods consolation in this time of grief and loss
2567010 the vietnamese catholic culture is very strong a lot of those who have come here have been through a great deal just to get to this country theyve always preserved their catholic faith this is a trial this is a challenge
2567011 mr darwish has died at 1 35 pm 1835 gmt
2567012 darwish is the essential breath of the palestinian people the eloquent witness of exile and belonging
2567013 we woke up from a coma to see a monocoloured flag of hamas do away with the four colour flag of palestine
2567014 gaza won its independence from the west bank one people now have two states two prisons who dont greet each other we are victims dressed in executioners clothing
2567015 we have triumphed knowing that it is the occupier who really won
2567016 i have defeated you death all the beautiful arts have defeated you the songs of mesopotamia the obelisks of egypt the carved tombs of the pharaohs on the altar have defeated you and you are vanquished
2567017 the syrians said that a visit at this time was inopportune
2567018 syrias election to the board while under investigation for secretly building an undeclared nuclear reactor not suited for peaceful purposes would make a mockery
2567019 we have unrealistic expectations for people john edwards like the rest of us is only human
2567020 the truth is a lot of ordinary average americans have affairs
2567021 weve got one of the ablest candidates ever nominated and hes running against a man who really pretty much promises more of the same of what weve had the last eight years
2567022 i think its entirely up to senator edwards and his wife and the rest of us should keep quiet
2567023 the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2567024 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2567025 many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention
2567026 obviously a lot of people believed in john edwards people were passionate about his candidacy i think there are people who feel let down when you invest that much time and energy in a candidate and the candidate turns out to be less than you thought
2567027 the american public has become sensitised to this type of behaviour from political leaders
2567028 our staff put their faith and confidence in him and he let them down
2567029 we knew we had to bat well in the second innings and we are even stevens now if we can string another or two partnerships together it could be quite a good test match
2567030 the thing about him is that he scores so quickly weve always rated him highly he had a problem when he started but he was one of the guys we identified to bat three for us we needed to run with him and give him the opportunity hes blossomed and repaid the faith we showed in him
2567031 well have to bowl well tomorrow but theyre still behind with two key men out
2567032 most of the players called their parents i told them to be strong
2567033 president saakashvili decided that the georgian olympic delegation would remain in beijing
2567034 we are going to continue the competition with more passion and determination
2567035 we are going to play with more passion against all countries including russia
2567036 i had a headache this morning i felt so terrible that i didnt know how id shoot so to win the first gold medal of this olympics is pretty amazing
2567037 wasnt fully prepared for the pressure of competing at home
2567038 we have to focus on our own performance and this helps me to relax and not come under pressure
2567039 my biggest fear was whether wed be able to control the race as a team and in such humid and tremendous heat but we raced to perfection
2567040 i didnt think id swim that fast in the preliminaries i saw the first few heats go out and i kind of wanted to be the top seed for tomorrow that is all i went out to do
2567041 your talent is gods gift to you what you do with it is your gift back to god
2567042 i know that look that look means she wants to kill me bust a move
2567043 the chief called and told me that me and my family had been absolutely and completely cleared of any charges
2567044 he also said that he did not apologize for any action or wrongdoing by the police department although he did express regret about what has happened
2567045 huh we usually see more mourning doves than pigeons around here cos these parts arent too urban
2567046 ive learned a lot become a better professional and a better man because of my experience and my time in new york i dont regret or feel ashamed about anything that happened to me in my time in new york
2567047 the most difficult part is just the realization that the organization no longer wants you you spend eight years there and in the blink of an eye youre no longer wanted there
2567048 they told me that i was a hero and that they wished they could do the same in their countries
2567049 its very difficult to provide services to men who have sex with men in countries that dont acknowledge they exist or criminalize them if they do exist
2567050 to follow mexicos bold example and pass laws against homophobia
2567051 its a virus so you need to put the money where the virus is
2567052 these men believed they were not at risk because they were not having sex with sex workers or women which is what the campaign focused on
2567053 that scenario is being played out across the developing world
2567054 instead of saying they are gay its easier for them to justify their behavior they say they were drunk and they were really sexually excited and willing to have sex with whomever
2567055 in iran we dont have homosexuals like in your country
2567056 this means that we are not moving ahead with the fight against aids
2567057 totally panicked because until now they believed these men did not exist
2567058 i tell them to say things like there are many cultures where men are very close to men
2567059 if anyone asks a man that he will slap you
2567060 carol insists she remains on good terms with her ex husband who agreed as part of their divorce settlement to pay her medical costs for life i have no bitterness she says my accident is well recorded i had 23 operations i am five inches shorter than i used to be and i was in hospital for six months it was just awful but it wasnt the reason for my divorce
2567061 its a non story because edwards isnt running for anything now and who cares who he slept with
2567062 let he among us who is without sin cast the first stone
2567063 there are just some issues that you know to leave alone because the audience will not tolerate joking about it
2567064 even in today s coverage one can observe a lingering reticence to address the story directly
2567065 the world is about to end in 2012 cause the mayans made calendars and they stop at 2012 i got encyclopedias on the bus the world is about to end as we know it you can see it already a planet doesnt exist theres no more pluto planes are flying into buildings and not just the twin towers mosquitos bite you and you die and a black man and a woman are running for president
2567066 cum poate sa fie un film cu jet li atata de prost
2567067 its incredibly complex and our concern lies with the way all of these people are being depicted
2567068 theres a lot of family members who have been affected
2567069 every individual targeted as part of this operation has a criminal record
2567070 you have no idea how satisfying it is to drill a really good hole
2567071 t he officers pepper sprayed sheehan but she continued to is zappos com getting into the music business we read twitter so you dont have to
2567072 i love it and have stalked it for years if i thought peeing on the gate to keep other people away would help i would be on my way up the hill right now
2567073 we spelen zo een wedstrijd ik denk niet dat we hier nu over moeten praten maar wielaert is nog steeds welkom
2567074 maar de clubs moeten er wel uitkomen ik ga geen arbitragezaak aanspannen
2567075 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
2567076 actor comedian bernie mac passed away this morning from complications due to pneumonia in a chicago area hospital
2567077 the majority of his core fan base will remember that when they paid their money to see bernie mac he gave them their moneys worth
2567078 race and class while lifting viewers with laughter compassion and cool
2567079 now everyone telling me what i cant do what i can say what i should do and asking are blacks gonna be mad at you
2567080 from very early on i thought he was destined for success
2567081 he never lost track of where he came from and hed often use real life experiences his family his friends in his routine after he made it he stayed a very humble man his family was the most important thing in the world to him
2567082 im going to still do my producing my films but i want to enjoy my life a little bit
2567083 i missed a lot of things you know i was a street performer for two years i went into clubs in 1977

2567085 i decided to try to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
2567086 hosting the olympics will bring a lot of revenue into the country and created many jobs and opportunities for people especially poor migrant workers
2567087 estimated about 4 billion watching the olympic opening ceremony is amazing
2567088 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2567089 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2567090 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2567091 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2567092 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2567093 that is simply in obvious disacord with all my previous experience
2567094 el per me encanta porque es como mi segundo hogar
2567095 why is my body enveloped with this kind of warmth and
2567096 an expression of intent to inflict evil injury or damage
2567097 we cannot run society for the privileged and allow a significant proportion of the population to be marginalized it impacts the quality of life for all of us if we have throwaway people a justice system which tolerates injustice is doomed to collapse i am truly ready for action
2567098 the cultural survival of more than 13 indigenous nations is directly intertwined with the environmental integrity of the holy san francisco peaks
2567099 todays decision not only places these ways of life in peril but sets the stage for an ecological and public health catastrophe we have no choice but to uphold our commitment to protect the holy san francisco peaks
2567100 only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience that is the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities the diminishment of spiritual fulfillment serious though it may be is not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion
2567101 the court places itself in the position of judging the legitimacy of native american beliefs and practices it becomes the arbiter of religion which is not the proper role for the courts the evidence clearly shows that the peaks are important to 13 of the tribes in the southwestern united states and that using sewer water to make snow on them constitutes a significant burden on the tribes ability to practice their religion
2567102 in this country native americans have no first amendment rights when it comes to government land use decisions
2567103 the federal government likely holds thousands of acres of land that tribes hold sacred this case was the last best chance for the tribes to be able to provide some legal protection to those lands in a nation that prides itself on religious liberty it is unconscionable that native american beliefs are not respected under the law or the constitution we anticipate petitioning the u s supreme court for review of this matter
2567104 this ruling sets a negative precedent that impacts the future of native american religious practice
2567105 religious exercise invariably and centrally involves a subjective spiritual experience
2567106 the majoritys misunderstanding of the nature of religious beliefs and exercise as merely
2567107 rfra was passed to protect the exercise of all religions including the religions of american indians if indians land based exercise of religion is not protected by rfra in this case i cannot imagine a case in which it will be i am truly sorry that the majority has effectively read american indians out of rfra
2567108 this decision is a painful affirmation of the lack of protection for our religious freedom
2567109 it is a bitter reminder that not all citizens are equal in this country but just as the civil rights movement did not give up when courts delivered blow after blow we will not give up until our rights are fully upheld we the youth will continue to stand up for our cultural survival
2567110 federal land management policies are inconsistent when addressing native american religious practice relating to sacred places this case underscores the fact that we need legislative action to guarantee protection for places held holy by native american tribes
2567111 the deeply held religious beliefs of hundreds of thousands of citizens of this country have been trumped by a single for profit private business operating on public lands
2567112 eight of eleven judges decided to completely ignore the issue of what happens if a child were to eat this snow
2567113 the court dismissed the whole health issue on a procedural error thereby refusing to comment on the true health impacts of this fake snow which has been proven to contain harmful pharmaceuticals and personal care productions on our children the court has obviously cast off this responsibility and we will continue to demand accountability for our children and the land
2567114 we obviously disagree with ruling snowmaking with sewage is still plainly a bad idea
2567115 well keep fighting along side our partners this ruling only emboldens our resolve
2567116 democrats bear the brunt of blame for our energy mess today
2567117 democrats this week chose the prayer of alternative energy over proven prosperity theyve handed prosperity in the here and now to the republicans run with it
2567118 this is the willie horton of 2008 the issue that we have to take back and own or lose
2567119 remember the cheapest form of energy is the energy we dont need to buy in the first place and yet even while americans are worried about making their dollar stretch as far as it can the tremendous power of energy efficiency is being dismissed leadership is the missing ingredient strong forward thinking leaders would 1 show americans that efficiency isnt about sacrifice its about ingenuity high tech solutions and saving money 2 enact policies that give car makers tire manufacturers and motor oil companies incentives to make more efficient products
2567120 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2567121 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2567122 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2567123 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2567124 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2567125 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2567126 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2567127 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2567128 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2567129 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2567130 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2567131 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2567132 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2567133 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2567134 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2567135 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2567136 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2567137 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
2567138 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2567139 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2567140 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2567141 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2567142 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2567143 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2567144 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
2567145 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
2567146 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
2567147 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
2567148 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
2567149 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
2567150 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
2567151 the global warming climate change issue is so important that people on both sides of the issue including policymakers should be fully informed before policy is actually formulated tragically thats not happening in the global warming issue
2567152 many things we thought we knew about the climate system just a few years ago are now proving to be uncertain or quite mistaken
2567153 its become quite news worthy to go out and tell people that we are about to have an apocalyptic climate change and the moment you make that announcement its easy to go around the world and find things to support that viewpoint
2567154 the ipcc is a political organization setup by the un to provide evidence to support the framework convention on climate change its entirely political they made up what they were going to do beforehand and choose whatever science they ipcc could find to support their theory
2567155 this cuts at the heart of national sovereignty of the u s we would be saying that we would allow an international body to come in and dictate to our industries our businesses our people what they can do and what they cant do the use of what energy the sources of energy the cost of energy etc
2567156 carbon dioxide gas co2 lags behind temperature changes in history by 800 years co2 doesnt cause temperature change
2567157 based on the evidence of ice core studies at the polar ice caps it shows that co2 follows temperature not the opposite so the fundamental assumption of the whole theory of climate change by human intervention of co2 emissions causing temperature changes is wrong
2567158 human intervention accounts for a small fraction of co2 of the atmospheric gases in the atmosphere that water vapor accounts for about 97 of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere co2 accounts for 1 9 therefore man is responsible for less than 3 of all greenhouse effect in the atmosphere globally
2567159 0 55f 0 30c cooler than the 1971 2000 average
2567160 my concern is that we may be moving away from an irrational lack of concern about climate change to an equally irrational panic about it
2567161 the problem is that in this panic we are going to spend our money unwisely we will take actions that are counterproductive and we will fail to do many of those things that will benefit the environment and ourselves for example right now the clearest threat to many species is habitat destruction take the orangutans for instance one of those charismatic species that people are often fascinated by and concerned about they are endangered because of deforestation in our fear of global warming it would be sad if we fail to find funds to purchase those forests before they are destroyed and thus let this species go extinct at the heart of the matter is how much faith we decide to put in science even how much faith scientists put in science our times have benefited from clear thinking science based rationality i hope this prevails as we try to deal with our changing climate
2567162 co founder of ipcc al gore is trying to be a climate change profiteer essentially he wants to make a fortune by creating a new market for a product that he is attempting to create by legislative fiat if he succeeds and carbon emissions trading comes to the united states al gore will be uniquely positioned to cash in hes made sure of that
2567163 gore himself is chairman and founder of a private equity firm called generation investment management gim he says the london based firm invests money from institutions and wealthy investors in companies that are becoming environmentally friendly to use green parlance gim appears to have considerable influence over major carbon credit trading firms the u s based chicago climate exchange ccx and the u k based carbon neutral company cnc ccx appears to be the only firm in the u s that claims to trade carbon credits as a politician gore speaks warmly of transparency but as gim chairman gore has not been forthcoming little is known about his shadowy firms finances where it gets funding and what projects it supports
2567164 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2567165 the consensus in kyoto as outlined in the ipcc report will bind america to reduce energy consumption by 25 which will have a devastating effect on the american standard of living and the u s economy it will continue to drive more industries out of america for a more global economy
2567166 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2567167 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2567168 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2567169 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2567170 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2567171 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
2567172 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
2567173 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
2567174 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
2567175 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2567176 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
2567177 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
2567178 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
2567179 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
2567180 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2567181 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2567182 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
2567183 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
2567184 will create 40 50 less carbon emission and use half the fuel of other similar houseboats
2567185 arise and take our stand for freedom as in the olden time
2567186 before the decade is out to put a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth
2567187 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2567188 it would be impossible to solely credit the surge for the turn around
2567189 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
2567190 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
2567191 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
2567192 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
2567193 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
2567194 just so you all know we did set a record
2567195 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
2567196 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
2567197 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
2567198 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
2567199 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
2567200 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
2567201 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
2567202 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2567203 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2567204 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2567205 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2567206 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2567207 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2567208 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2567209 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2567210 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2567211 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2567212 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2567213 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2567214 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2567215 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
2567216 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling
2567217 environmentalist did not make gas go to over 4 gallon
2567218 i dont want to have to change my life even it it benefits society as a whole
2567219 humans are an infinitessimally small part of the global eco system
2567220 its the downturn that has made greenery look unappetising but it may yet prove to do more than anything to save the planet
2567221 it runs on biodiesel and im gonna put solar on it someday
2567222 recently mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2567223 mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
2567224 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
2567225 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2567226 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2567227 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2567228 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2567229 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2567230 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2567231 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
2567232 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
2567233 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
2567234 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
2567235 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
2567236 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
2567237 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
2567238 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
2567239 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
2567240 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
2567241 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
2567242 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
2567243 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
2567244 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
2567245 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
2567246 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
2567247 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
2567248 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2567249 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
2567250 ada perkembangan baik sekali dibanding minggu lalu sudah bisa mengenali orang
2567251 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
2567252 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
2567253 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
2567254 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
2567255 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
2567256 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
2567257 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2567258 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
2567259 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
2567260 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
2567261 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
2567262 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
2567263 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
2567264 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
2567265 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
2567266 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
2567267 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
2567268 impose a limit on marriage to provide that only marraige between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california brown was persuaded to write this by a petition from opponents of gay marriage brown believes that the lawsuit regarding gay marriage was more about politics than about law
2567269 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2567270 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2567271 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2567272 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2567273 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
2567274 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
2567275 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2567276 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
2567277 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
2567278 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
2567279 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
2567280 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
2567281 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
2567282 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
2567283 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
2567284 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
2567285 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
2567286 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
2567287 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
2567288 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
2567289 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
2567290 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
2567291 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
2567292 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
2567293 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
2567294 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
2567295 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2567296 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2567297 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2567298 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
2567299 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
2567300 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
2567301 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
2567302 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
2567303 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
2567304 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
2567305 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
2567306 is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family
2567307 washington defense secretary robert m gates will endorse a 20 billion plan to substantially increase the size of afghanistan s army and will also restructure the military command of american and nato forces in response to the growing taliban threat senior pentagon and military officials said thursday
2567308 taken together the two decisions are an acknowledgment of shortcomings that continue to hinder nato and american led operations in afghanistan with the war in iraq still an obstacle to any immediate american troop increase in afghanistan the plan was described by officials as an attempt to increase allied and afghan capabilities in advance of deploying the additional american brigades that mr gates and his commanders agree are necessary
2567309 activate a network about black men having sex with white women something which many white men still feel queasy about
2567310 the soviet union citing the 1978 treaty of friendship cooperation and good neighborliness that had been signed between the two countries intervened on december 24 1979 over 100 000 soviet troops took part in the invasion backed by another 100 000 plus and by members of the parcham faction amin was killed and replaced by babrak karmal the soviet occupation resulted in the killings of at least 600 000 to 2 million afghan civilians over five million afghans fled their country to pakistan iran and other parts of the world faced with mounting international pressure and great number of casualties on both sides the soviets withdrew in 1989
2567311 nato took command of the nationwide mission to stabilize afghanistan in 2006 the allies expected to face little direct combat and to focus on reconstruction and on maintaining security in areas that were relatively calm in contrast the american led mission in afghanistan has focused from the start of the war on combat operations to capture or kill insurgents and terrorists as well as on training afghan security forces counter insurgency and reconstruction
2567312 yup but it would be much cheaper to just buy the opium crop
2567313 meanwhile the taliban managed to nearly eradicate the majority of the opium production by 2001
2567314 as much as one third of afghanistans gdp comes from growing poppy and illicit drugs including opium and its two derivatives morphine and heroin as well as hashish production opium production in afghanistan has soared to a new record in 2007
2567315 it should be noted that operation enduring freedom afghanistan which is a joint us and afghan operation is separate from the isaf international security assistance force isaf which is an operation of nato nations including the usa the two operations run in parallel and although has been intended that they merge for some time this has not yet happened
2567316 i ask are we in fact at war with radical islam world wide and if so just say it
2567317 obamas popularity is not because of his race but in spite of it he is popular because of his charisma enthusiasm vision energy convictions and because of the confidence and hope that emanate from his persona
2567318 his stated policies are potentially extremely destructive and foolish such as massive tax increases and protectionism
2567319 it is our business however to go after terrorist enemies of the united states and our nato allies wherever we find them
2567320 it is this intensely emotional response to obama that is such a concern his followers love him with the zeal of cult members without bothering to discuss policy
2567321 what i am now is a citizen of a country that was attacked by people who flew commercial airplanes into buildings and i think we need to keep that in mind
2567322 but none of obamas supporters bothered to discover the facts which are readily available
2567323 is this e mail real it says no it is a bogus bunch of bird droppings
2567324 principles often take a back seat when there is a substantial economic consideration
2567325 youre using the obama campaign site as a reference for his tax policies
2567326 q would obama tax my profits if i sell my home would he tax my ira would he tax my water
2567327 i think the most reasonable take is that obama is probably doing just fine
2567328 like you said that left us no choice but to intervene destroy the training camps and remove the taleban from power since it was fairly clearly that they were in cahoots with al qaeda
2567329 all of that schoolgirl frenzy is frightening because there is no place for logic or thought
2567330 not that i am denying the possibility of it being a great conspiracy either
2567331 you sound like the republican version of a yellow dog democrat you spout nothing but republican cant
2567332 for bin laddin to keep getting volunteers something has to be causing them to join what do you suppose it could be
2567333 perhaps you use the self promotional material of a candidate to make decisions about their policies i preefer not to
2567334 some of his stated policies my emphasis are potentially extremely destructive and foolish
2567335 in the islamic world by their standards people who are called moderates are indistinguishable from terrorists by ours
2567336 the mere presence of an iraq run by friendly to the us and containing us troops is anathema to iranian fundamentalism and its desires for the iraqi south and the holiest shrines of the shia imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2567337 it may be ifficult for you to understand iran and islamic facism is the nazi threat of this century
2567338 among the most disturbing political phenomena of our time is the emergence in the newly created state of israel of the freedom party herut a political party closely akin in its organization method political philosophy and social appeal to the nazi and fascist parties
2567339 hitlers legal power was based upon the enabling act which was passed quite legally by the reichstag and which allowed the fuehrer and his representatives in plain language to be what they wanted or in legal language to issue regulations having the force of law exactly the same type of act was passed by the knesset israelis parliament immediately after the 1967 conquest granting the israeli governor and his representatives the power of hitler which they use in hitlerian manner
2567340 but go ahead ed subscribe to the neville chamberlen nelson mandela jimmy carter theory of appeasement
2567341 jewish villages were built in the place of arab villages you do not even know the names of these arab villages and i do not blame you because geography books no longer exist not only do the books not exist the arab villages are not there either nahlal arose in the place of mahlul kibbutz gvat in the place of jibta kibbutz sarid in the place of huneifis and kefar yehushua in the place of tal al shuman there is not a single place built in this country that did not have a former arab population
2567342 we will have to face the reality that israel is neither innocent nor redemptive and that in its creation and expansion we as jews have caused what we historically have suffered a refugee population in diaspora
2567343 when we followers of the prophetic judaism returned to palestine the majority of jewish people preferred to learn from hitler rather than from us
2567344 imagine how intolerable it is for iran to have the us in the nations all around it turkey afghanistan saudi arabia iraq pakistan etc
2567345 you conviently forget israel won the land when they were attacked in 48 67
2567346 spirit the penniless population across the frontier by denying it employment both the process of expropriation and the removal of the poor must be carried out discreetly and circumspectly
2567347 between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country we shall not achieve our goal if the arabs are in this small country there is no other way than to transfer the arabs from here to neighboring countries all of them not one village not one tribe should be left
2567348 the police of the world as well as judge jury and executioner
2567349 i think a two by four will work just fine i just need to apply it a little less sparingly
2567350 question on my part as in israel and palistine i am ill informed is the current thinking in israel the same as in 1895 and 1940 respectfully
2567351 the zionist movement arose in late nineteenth century europe influenced by the nationalist ferment sweeping that continent zionism acquired its particular focus from the ancient jewish longing for the return to zion and received a strong impetus from the increasingly intolerable conditions facing the large jewish community in tsarist russia the movement also developed at the time of major european territorial acquisitions in asia and africa and benefited from the european powers competition for influence in the shrinking ottoman empire one result of this involvement with european expansionism however was that the leaders of the nascent nationalist movements in the middle east viewed zionism as an adjunct of european colonialism moreover zionist assertions of the contemporary relevance of the jews historical ties to palestine coupled with their land purchases and immigration alarmed the indigenous population of the ottoman districts that comprised palestine the jewish community yishuv rose from 6 percent of palestines population in 1880 to 10 percent by 1914 although the numbers were insignificant the settlers were outspoken enough to arouse the opposition of arab leaders and induce them to exert counter pressure on the ottoman regime to prohibit jewish immigration and land buying
2567352 an independent individual who does not go along with a group or party
2567353 how about compensation for jews kicked out all over the world
2567354 israel has the most powerful military in the region including nuclear weapons and has the unconditional support of the most powerful nation in the world the usa
2567355 so what did you think of it i was lucky enough to get into the olympic stadium to watch the
2567356 the city watchdog the financial services authority has told the uks banks to make sure they are strong enough to
2567357 since june the uk top 40 has featured a hidden advertisement for chewing gum it turns out that chris browns
2567358 el segundo viol n yo siempre puedo encontrar cantidad de primeros violines pero encontrar a alguien que toque el segundo viol n o segunda trompeta de pistones o segunda flauta con el mismo entusiasmo es un problema y si nadie toca el segundo instrumento no hay armon a
2567359 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
2567360 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
2567361 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
2567362 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
2567363 it was felt that having a toll increase on a holiday weekend where most of the traffic tends to be cash paying we would see some confusion that we did not feel was appropriate for the labor day weekend
2567364 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
2567365 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
2567366 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
2567367 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
2567368 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
2567369 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
2567370 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2567371 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
2567372 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
2567373 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
2567374 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
2567375 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
2567376 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
2567377 last year we were able to hold a roster spot open for gary as he attempted to make a monumental comeback
2567378 after he underwent a knee scope last week we are unfortunately not in a position to hold a roster spot this year we are releasing gary today in hopes he will be able to continue his rehab and get back into the nfl either with another team or possibly with the browns gary has made tremendous strides thus far and we believe he can play professional football again in the future
2567379 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
2567380 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2567381 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2567382 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
2567383 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
2567384 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
2567385 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
2567386 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
2567387 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
2567388 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
2567389 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
2567390 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
2567391 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
2567392 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
2567393 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
2567394 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
2567395 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2567396 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
2567397 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
2567398 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2567399 the un secretary general had not uttered a word meaning that he respects our law and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us air it out in clarion call to say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2567400 why should gore and the former us vice president give judgment of evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning for the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2567401 but if they had any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2567402 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2567403 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2567404 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2567405 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2567406 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
2567407 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
2567408 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
2567409 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
2567410 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
2567411 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
2567412 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2567413 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2567414 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2567415 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2567416 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2567417 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2567418 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2567419 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
2567420 shawty buck if you think you bad and ill knock yo ass out and then shoot

2567422 russell mesler is a lawrence resident and an emeritus professor in kansas universitys department of chemical and petroleum engineering
2567423 bozo your ad hominem comment directed against professor mesler is not only out of line
2567424 were spending 1 trillion a year on the war department
2567425 where does uranium fuel come from canada australia the former soviet union and africa the last time i checked how does this make us less reliant on foreign sources how long is the uranium supply supposed to last at current consumption 50 years
2567426 did none of you read that even at 100 utilization of wind energy in kansas is is 384 mwatts
2567427 misinformation is wrong or inaccurate information it is distinguished from disinformation by motive misinformation is simply erroneous while disinformation in contrast is intended to mislead
2567428 i guess we can understand why mr mesler has a vested interest in supplying this bit of disinformation
2567429 please explain what ive read is the true 100 utilization of wind energy would meet all of kansass energy needs with plenty left for export
2567430 offset and with all the availble energy you can only offset 20
2567431 wind energy only and the countries with wind energy are using it to
2567432 asbestos and the columnist talked about the subsidies that wind gets
2567433 they just got 10 billion taxpayer dollars in the energy policy act of 2005 to jumpstart the moribund industry and utilities were given until the end of 2008 to sign up for a new nuke and qualify for the huge taxbreaks cost sharing and risk insurance protection in the package
2567434 sorry dude but that was the point of the article there is only 386
2567435 1 3 wind turbines will not produce power efficiently below a wind speed of 15mph they must be disengaged at wind speeds over 50mph to prevent damage to the turbine they also require a fairly demanding amount of maintenance
2567436 wind and pv systems should be installed in every house in the united states for those people that want to participate to offset their energy bill
2567437 short term threat to the growth of wind energy is the looming expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this year but the wind industry should not ask for more government support it should be made to stand on its own
2567438 have you conducted an energy audit on your system capital operational maintenance revenue all in joules if your system doesnt produce more energy than it took to make maintain operate and dispose then dont bother
2567439 asbestos i stand by my talking about per capita energy consumption and california per capita consumption has stayed flat for the past 30 years look it up
2567440 as a taxpayer this is a poor use of my monies and i might add it a poor use of my monies collected by utilities as a ratepayer
2567441 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2567442 wind energy away pretty clear that the author was correct and he was stating in the 300
2567443 http www nrel gov docs fy00osti 28085 in state wind energy potential 235 200 mw capacity after land use
2567444 that means that the state has 235 gigawatts of wind energy potential 1 gigawatt is 1000 megawatts look it up
2567445 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
2567446 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
2567447 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
2567448 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
2567449 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
2567450 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
2567451 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
2567452 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
2567453 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
2567454 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
2567455 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
2567456 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
2567457 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
2567458 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
2567459 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
2567460 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
2567461 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
2567462 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
2567463 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
2567464 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
2567465 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
2567466 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
2567467 i believe that hes poised and healthy to have that same kind of season this year
2567468 he put a great bookend at the front of his career and can bookend it on the back if he stays healthy hes in line to maybe be the schools all time leader in all purpose yards and all time leading rusher

2567476 the taliban were gathering for a meeting in an area of bala boluk district

2567479 the result is likely very soon many problems of bnp will be resolved as soon as khaleda zia is freed
2567480 the government has made its position clear on the matter during the release of another former prime minister sheikh hasina
2567481 there were some problems which are being resolved to ensure the release procedure
2567482 the government is in contact with the bnp we hope to conclude the procedure soon
2567483 the government is going to hold the second round of dialogue with the awami league very soon the party is eager to discuss the two issues there
2567484 the government will take all decisions in consultation with the parties all parties will have to be persuaded
2567485 the government has made itself an opponent of bnp weve no time to waste everyone will have to prepare to launch a movement well give programmes in phases
2567486 two sets of law are in force in one country somebody is being released and sent abroad our leader has been confined to the jail it does not go with the characteristics of a neutral government they are working following the dictates of a special quarter
2567487 we have boycotted the local government election which was a right decision the person who is saying that it was not the right thing to do has no right to say so he is nobody to bnp
2567488 bnp will not participate in any election without khaleda zia a fair election must be held with the participation of all parties and leaders including khaleda zia otherwise the country will drift into further instability

2567556 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2567557 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being

2567569 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2567570 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2567571 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries

2567693 hunt 1994 p 253 260 not to be confused with the aetosaur
2567694 i feel your pain but im not convinced there are monographic descriptions of certain key triassic crurotarsans every bit as good if not far better as some of the dinosaur literature thats been used to create high fidelity reconstructions on aetosaurs have you seen for example sawin 1947 long amp murry 1995 and desojo amp baez 2005 full refs given in my articles note also that fairly decent skeletal reconstructions of some triassic crurotarsan taxa already exist they appear in works by sereno paul parrish and desojo amp baez its just that they havent been used much

2567697 in summary williamson and carr continue to misidentify pachycephalosaurid taxa based on a typological approach which is a consistent pattern of these two authors their most recent contribution williamson and carr 2006 only further muddies the scientific literature not only from a taxonomic and phylogenetic standpoint but also a biostratigraphic one as well

2567718 wenn man sich die demografische und medizinische entwicklung anschaut wird klar dass wir insgesamt viel mehr und nicht weniger kapitaldeckung und damit auch mehr und nicht weniger private krankenversicherungen brauchen
2567719 die gesundheitsreform hat das gesch ft der privaten krankenversicherung erschwert

2568027 5 two members of the cmu board of trustees gave gary peters campaign contributions and never disclosed their obvious and apparent conflict of interest during the hiring process additionally the former holder of the griffin professorship gave him money and he was even consulted for a recommendation during this corrupted hiring process

2568043 getting things done author david allen says that in order to get to a calm productive state of mind we have to slow down and think instead of trying to work more faster and harder one of the most subtle ways the better aspect of us retreats is in busy ness losing perspective in trying to control everything finish it all fix it all all at once getting things done out of frustration instead of inspiration helping out of compulsion not compassion

2568062 when russian tanks and troops poured into the separatist georgian province of south ossetia yesterday it was not as russian president dmitry medvedev said part of a peacekeeping mission it was part of an imperialist mission whose undeclared goal is to reabsorb the whole of georgia west leaning georgia with its critical oil pipeline supplying energy to an increasingly thirsty europe into mother russia

2568066 i found it hypocritical that in this town its all about lincoln we want to embrace him then you find out whoah this is who we are this is springfield
2568067 all day and all night long he had a gun on each shoulder and he marched from where our store was to our home and that was back and forth all evening
2568068 its a history that has to be brought out into the open it really has to be
2568069 it is extremely important that we take time to recognize the significance of the race riots that we teach our children all about them
2568070 and that we rededicate ourselves to the notion that we must all work together to ensure that something like that never happens again
2568071 it is disgraceful that this man who has only ever preached hatred against britain and everything it stands for is costing taxpayers so much money there is no way we should bankroll any more of his attempts to evade extradition britons dont pay their hard earned money in tax so it can be passed on to someone with such loathing for them

2568077 white americans in the north pretty much thought violence against blacks was a southern thing the springfield riot really came as a bolt of lightning to northern newspaper readers
2568078 the question was if it can happen in springfield maybe it can happen anywhere
2568079 this was the right thing to do theres no question in my mind
2568080 they turned it into tourism dollars this horror that occurred in their hometown
2568081 this would be like seeing a shirt that had the towers falling on 9 11 people making money off the tragedy that everyone had to endure
2568082 the negroes would come to the window and rush back they didnt dare come out for fear theyd get shot they went back in and anybody that i knew or talked to said there were negroes in there that were burned up
2568083 i get told times a great healer i wish time could rewind itself i wish this time would rewind so this person would see me graduate from university i wish time would rewind so that he could walk me down the aisle
2568084 this person was taken away from me right in front of my eyes accepting that hes not coming back is the hardest thing ever
2568085 my dad never saw my 16th birthday he never got to see me in my prom dress thats something every daughter wishes their dad to see
2568086 i cant believe he is gone he will never walk me down the aisle or see his grandchildren the night of his attack is a night i will never ever forget i will make sure that garry newlove my dad is never forgotten for the loving person he was
2568087 it hurts me to think what pain my dad went through on that night but i think he feels more pain to not be with his family right now
2568088 did the georgians ask the us or nato whether it would have our support before it launched the assault on south ossetia if not im not sure why it now thinks having got itself into this thing it is our job to help it get out
2568089 what goes on in the caucasus is of no consequence to the people or politics of britain please enough of this meaningless tittle tattle on completely irrelevant subjects and let us focus the discussion on our own country and its many pressing problems
2568090 one cannot deny that the legacy of the soviet union has left mighty russia and tiny georgia with a complex relationship to say the least

2568095 lots of guys from bombay were at all three marches so whats this about us not participating its just that i think we wanted to do this a bit differently and no why cant we be different this way we can have our cake go for any of the other three marches and also have our own where other cities can participate this time we have large contingents coming from pune surat baroda bangalore ahmedabad delhi and kolkata
2568096 sure there are class community and other differences at least bombay handles it honestly i know there are diferences in kolkata delhi and bangalore too and they flare up quite frequently on the net here we sit down and thrash them out across the table there is a saying in hindi when there are so many vessels close together they do make noise
2568097 come on bombay is different it is the most corporate and business like of all indian cities do you think any other city would have thought of pink gandhi topis for the march it also shows indias pluralism

2568104 his biggest strength is changing the way we make decisions and the way the country is governed moving away from divisive strategies and toward uniting strategies divisive strategies get us corruption and 5 gas
2568105 i think it will be a significant event as we nominate probably the first african american president of the united states i hope to go as we all do back from the convention motivated to work hard through november
2568106 no i think its great being a democrat in el paso county what weve seen is a lot of people democrats certainly but also independents and republicans are coming around to democratic points of view
2568107 i spent most of my air force career overseas before 9 11 and after 9 11
2568108 the message that we can work with the rest of the world is inspiring versus the message that were working against the rest of the world which i think is the message of the past seven years
2568109 everything its all a brand new experience to me im hoping to see everybody work together well i know there are questions about unity and people coming together and i hope they will
2568110 im a defense contractor so the vast majority of the people i work with are very conservative its fair to say im the odd man out here but ive found so many people working with more progressive groups so as soon as i get away from work its ok
2568111 i think thats overstated there are a lot of republicans and naturally conservative types in the military but there are patriots on every side of the political spectrum and a lot of them sign up to serve their country
2568112 i want to vote for hillary clinton thats my main goal and itll be great to learn more about the democratic process of the convention and be part of a historical event
2568113 i have because people are drawn to who theyre like so i found it a little difficult connecting with people because of my liberal views i do sometimes feel like a duck out of water
2568114 i would support hillary clinton if she decided thats what she wanted to do when i talk to obama people im just shaking my head sometimes because they see things so differently than i do
2568115 one i love politics and the political process in government and i knew this was going to be a historical election so i wanted to be a part of it
2568116 im hoping to learn more about how the two party system works in the united states i want to have a first hand look at how party platforms are decided and the intricacies of running a campaign
2568117 not at all the people i talk with generally even though they might disagree with me understand where im coming from
2568118 obama appears to be a fresh face hes not just one of those washington talking heads we see the way he conducts generating policy is new for example he involves everybody in the process not just the yes men who agree with him i think barack obama would be a president who would take my concerns to heart
2568119 throughout my life ive worked for change as a delegate it would give me an opportunity to be a part of history it would give me a chance to vote for the first african american candidate for president from a major party in the greatest country in the world
2568120 in the past yes this year its a lot different because democrats are coming out of the closet but has it been difficult yes
2568121 barack obama i was completely inspired by what his leadership will mean for our country i believe the right leader at the right time can make all the difference in any organization and theres nothing more important than our country and our future
2568122 im very very interested in us as a democratic party and as a nation coming together as one i really seek to be part of that unifying agent and bring whatever gifts i have
2568123 no not at all i feel passionately and others do too and i appreciate that greatly people have stopped me and asked how can i wear an obama t shirt but everyone is kind and gracious that ive observed i sometimes feel like a minority but im very optimistic so that sustains me
2568124 im just hoping it goes smoothly i was part of the group that worked to bring the convention to denver so i want to make colorado proud and make sure we show denver and colorado in the best light
2568125 no ive often been in republican areas in terms of learning politics i understand that every part of this state has an important role in squeezing as many democratic votes as we can out of every area
2568126 i was probably one of the first 20 or 30 superdelegates to pledge to senator obama so i didnt get the high level phone calls because i had already made up my mind and even if id been on the fence the democrats of colorado so overwhelmingly voted for obama that id support him
2568127 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2568128 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2568129 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2568130 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2568131 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2568132 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2568133 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2568134 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2568135 quaker organization that quaker oaks farm and outreach society the mission of marina del rey southern california and catalina island sailing charters
2568136 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2568137 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2568138 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2568139 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2568140 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2568141 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2568142 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2568143 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2568144 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2568145 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2568146 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2568147 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2568148 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2568149 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2568150 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2568151 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2568152 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2568153 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2568154 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2568155 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2568156 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2568157 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2568158 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2568159 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2568160 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2568161 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2568162 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2568163 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2568164 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2568165 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2568166 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2568167 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2568168 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2568169 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2568170 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2568171 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2568172 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2568173 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2568174 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2568175 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2568176 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2568177 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2568178 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2568179 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2568180 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2568181 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2568182 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2568183 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2568184 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2568185 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2568186 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2568187 they have to concentrate on competition but its very tough
2568188 we know it is the olympic games and all of us sportsmen want everything to be normal
2568189 when the war is in your country at such a time it is very difficult for them for all of us
2568190 we are tying to say hey lets have a truce for at least the olympic games so we bring some peace to the world even for two weeks the timing couldnt be worse war is not great at any time but to have it on the first day of the olympic competition was pretty bad timing
2568191 i see all the nations get together i am very upset about it i wish everybody would be at peace especially during the olympics
2568192 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2568193 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2568194 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2568195 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2568196 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2568197 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2568198 were calling for an end to the chinese governments occupation in tibet
2568199 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2568200 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2568201 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2568202 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2568203 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2568204 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2568205 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2568206 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2568207 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2568208 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2568209 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2568210 who are open to doing something on the production side
2568211 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2568212 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2568213 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2568214 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2568215 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2568216 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

2568220 the opf to referenda process will run independently of the governance structures of huu
2568221 this year open policy forums were introduced and havent been the biggest hit in the union it is all down to the shortcomings of the constitution it only had about three lines about opfs so really the uec have done a good job with it but this review cements it into the constitution
2568222 all members of uec except the chair are entitled to vote at uec all votes of uec shall be recorded and displayed in the minutes to allow uec to be held to account by council in the event of a tied vote the chair of uec shall have a casting vote in this instance the casting vote must be justified for the minutes

2568225 make no mistake the change in the way scotland votes has transformed the political landscape it has empowered voters to boot out previously unshakable administrations that simply dont enjoy popular support it has given a voice to independents and party candidates in places that were until 2007 no go areas

2568233 in december 2003 california secretary of state kevin shelley released my vote counts californias plan for voting in the 21st century which outlines californias plan for complying with the help america vote act hava the state expects to receive over 100 million in hava funds in november 2003 the secretary of state issued a position paper on the deployment of touch screen voting systems in california
2568234 in india the electronic system allowed the results to be announced a matter of hours after the polls closed
2568235 to minimise the risk of fraud voting machines should produce voter verifiable audit trails rather than the voter completing a ballot paper the machine should produce a ballot paper which the voter verifies and then puts in a ballot box should there be a dispute over the result the paper ballots should be regarded as the definitive votes rather than those recorded on the machines additionally there should be safeguards equivalent to those described for e counting
2568236 following the march 2004 primary election the performance of diebold touch screen systems used in some california counties came under increased scrutiny in public hearings conducted by the secretary of states voting systems and procedures panel it was confirmed not only that uncertified versions of diebold software had been used in some counties but that some of the software had been inadequately tested and had performed poorly resulting in lost and miscast votes

2568239 i have to spend part of the summer holiday working at another job to pay back this debt i got in order to be a teacher
2568240 you know some people counted me out and said to drop out but the american people dont quit and they deserve a president who doesnt quit either
2568241 as with boxing the bma opposes mixed martial arts mma fighting and calls for a complete ban on this type of contact sport ultimate fighting can be extremely brutal and has been described as human cockfighting it can cause traumatic brain injury joint injuries and fractures the bma believes that doctors cannot stand by while violent fighting tournaments are allowed to take place large amounts of money can be earned by participants promoters and others linked to ultimate fighting but no amount of money can compensate for permanent brain damage and premature death
2568242 you had people saying guys were going to get maimed they were drawing comparisons with boxing and saying its more brutal and guess what there wasnt a single ko for something like 6 months
2568243 high court judge justice tendayi uchena yesterday dismissed with costs an application by mdc t seeking an order compelling the zimbabwe electoral commission to announce results of the presidential election
2568244 trying to interfere with the independence of zec would create problems in future

2568247 the anc regards the zimbabwe ruling party zanu pf as an ally however it is concerned with the state of crisis that zimbabwe is in and perceives this as negative for the entire sadc region
2568248 government spokesman bright matonga said the only violence in zimbabwe was by the opposition mdc party which he said had
2568249 the international community given the consequences of the situation there has a responsibility also to engage with the issues
2568250 all members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state
2568251 not too long ago my opponent made a prediction he said i would probably win pennsylvania he would win north carolina and indiana would be the tiebreaker well tonight weve come from behind weve broken the tie and thanks to you its full speed onto the white house
2568252 you know there are those who were saying that north carolina would be a game changer in this election but today what north carolina decided is that the only game that needs changing is the one in washington d c i want to start by congratulating senator clinton on what appears to be her victory in the great state of indiana
2568253 government by the people a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system
2568254 and among the people whom i got to know who became not only friends but heroes were barbara jordan who taught me a lot about courage and today would actually be her birthday i remember all the time about how she got up every single morning facing almost insurmountable odds to do what she did and another was my great friend ann richards who taught me so much about determination ann was a great champion for the people of texas she also reminded us that every so often it is good to have a laugh about what it is were engaged in

2568261 i went online to find out what to do and what bus to take
2568262 the bus driver was very helpful and so were the other passengers
2568263 i enjoyed it it was just getting over that initial scariness
2568264 i got tired of figuring out where to park and walking from there to work there was no designated parking for us and if i wanted to park close to my office i had to pay quite a bit of money i found out the jo had a route that went right in front of my office
2568265 i like meeting all the people who ride the bus and ive developed friendships the neat part is the variety of people you meet on the bus we have people who bike to the oak park mall and then ride downtown its a good fraternity and sorority on the bus
2568266 you might have a new driver the weather might be bad or there might be a lot of people riding give it a couple days
2568267 i dont miss driving to work every once in while i drive in just to break the routine or if i want to stay late but i enjoy riding the bus
2568268 i wasnt familiar with the northland area i also rode the bus to save money
2568269 they become like family and you look forward to seeing them i know all the people on the bus and they know me
2568270 were going to battle go all the way to the convention win this thing and get to the white house
2568271 this is not an easy decision for me i hate to lose my family my friends and our supporters many of you right here in this room have given a great deal to get me where i have a shot at becoming president if this were only about me i would go on but i entered this race because i love america and because i love america i feel i must now stand aside for our party and for our country i will continue to stand for conservative principles i will fight alongside you for all the things we believe in and one of those things is that we cannot allow the next president of the united states to retreat in the face evil extremism

2568274 i want to thank my dear friend my dear friend rudy giuliani who invested his heart and soul in this primary and who conducted himself with all the qualities of the exceptional american leader he truly is
2568275 with our convictions and a little backbone we will take back the white house in november

2568310 thank you florida republicans for bringing a former florida resident across the finish line first in as i have been repeatedly reminded lately an all republican primary my friends in one week we will have as close to a national primary as we have ever had in this country i intend to win it and be the nominee of our party
2568311 thank you folks for being here god bless every one of you pray hard work hard get the votes out remember this if theyre going to vote for me make sure they come if theyre not dont let them out of their driveway
2568312 today i have withdrawn my candidacy for president of the united states i hope that my country and my party have benefited from our having made this effort
2568313 we gave our troops a new mission work with the iraqi forces to protect the iraqi people
2568314 the american and iraqi surges have achieved results few of us could have imagined just one year ago
2568315 some may deny that the surge is working but among the terrorists there is no doubt al qaeda is on the run in iraq and this enemy will be defeated
2568316 you will have all you need to protect our nation
2568317 we will stay on the offence we will keep up the pressure and we will deliver justice to our enemies
2568318 perhaps most troubling was the presidents steadfast commitment to an iraq policy that has led to the deaths of nearly 4 000 american troops continues to cost this country billions of dollars per month and fails to make us safer in the global fight against al qaeda and its affiliates the presidents policies are keeping nearly 160 000 american troops stuck in iraq and sapping our ability to address the global terrorist threat presented by al qaeda
2568319 tonight was president bushs last state of the union and i do not believe history will judge his administration kindly but i also believe the failures of the last seven years stem not just from any single policy but from a broken politics in washington
2568320 i applaud the presidents efforts to reduce earmarks and their influence on federal government spending earmarks and pork barrel spending steal valuable taxpayer dollars from national priorities skew the budget process and have led to corruption among lawmakers
2568321 we do not yet know for certain who will have the honor of being the democratic partys nominee for president but we know where either of their candidates will lead this country and we dare not let them they will promise a new approach to governing but offer only the policies of a political orthodoxy that insists the solution to governments failures is to simply make it bigger
2568322 i seek the presidency with the humility of a man who cannot forget that my country saved me
2568323 today the change we seek swept through the chesapeake and over the potomac we won the state of maryland we won the commonwealth of virginia and though we won in washington d c this movement wont stop until theres change in washington d c and tonight were on our way tonight were on our way but we know how much further we have to go we know it takes more than one night or even one election to overcome decades of money and the influence the bitter partisanship and petty bickering that shut you out let you down told you to settle

2568346 robbie is one of those players who can come in straight away and hit the ground running
2568347 he has played all his career in the premier league with a one year spell in italy so he doesnt need to take any time to settle in
2568348 he can make an impact from the first whistle there is no getting used to the speed of the game or anything like that
2568349 all he has to do is get to know the boys and tune in to their games where they like to make runs where they are going to want him to run to and so on
2568350 he will give the manager plenty of options in the striking positions he can play straight through the middle as a partner for shoulder to shoulder
2568351 or you can withdraw him slightly from fernando and play him in the hole between the strikers and midfield
2568352 he will be effective in either role you only have to look at how he fitted and moulded his game around dimitar berbatov at tottenham to see the potential that he and torres have as a pairing
2568353 berbatov scored a lot of goals from direct final passes from keane or from his movement and ability to create space
2568354 and when keane gets into position himself in front of goal he can finish as well as anyone
2568355 torres is maybe just a step above berbatov because he is a lot younger so you have to be licking your lips at the prospect of them being unleashed on the premier league
2568356 it was amazing it was emotional it was such a dramatic moment
2568357 we hope that any success we have goes to making our sport more popular
2568358 if we can get even one girl to take up fencing then weve done well
2568359 it hasnt been an issue that has impeded our performance at all
2568360 i kind of got my head back in the bout that i was in because i was really hung up on my last bout
2568361 i dont think i anticipated the emotion i would feel up there
2568362 even though im in quebec this orchestra is part of our national heritage
2568363 ive already talked with business people around the country the idea is at least to provide the orchestra with the funds to keep going for an interim period
2568364 some kind of a joint venture with the cbc or a total spinoff
2568365 they have pretty strong management theyre in a changing environment and they have made their decision but that doesnt mean the orchestra has to stop living
2568366 its a national platform for canadian talent and canadian art
2568367 this may be the time for us to think about how a real 21st century orchestra should develop

2568370 playing that well with the crowd behind china quieting them its a great feeling
2568371 they seemed very unaffected by the crowd they seemed to feed off the energy in the stands and it didnt bother them at all
2568372 i think this was one of the better performances i have seen from a focused effort from tactical discipline from goal scoring chances consistency and also we seemed to be by far the fitter team out there and that surprised me a little bit
2568373 i just really wanted to show this team is here to compete
2568374 were going to come out here with undying canadian pride and honour were just going to throw it down
2568375 if people perform the way they know how to were going to swim really fast were going to compete really hard and were going to have good results because of it
2568376 hes very tall with long arms and i was on the defensive too much
2568377 i felt ok out there but it was a tough fight because hes the world champion
2568378 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2568379 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2568380 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2568381 it works with mod perl but what about normal cgi scripts
2568382 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2568383 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2568384 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2568385 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2568386 russia for lord only knows what reason seems to have imperial ambitions in the tiny insignificant territory of south ossetia
2568387 how many divisions do you think i should use to invade the soviet union
2568388 i think we should step back and let another country of the un take the reins preferably one in europe
2568389 gee i wonder where those pesky russians ever got the idea to expand their empire into tiny insignificant countries that had nothing to do with 9 11 i dont get it
2568390 the majority of the roughly 70 000 people living in south ossetia are ethnically distinct from georgians they say they were forcibly absorbed into georgia under soviet rule and now want to exercise their right to self determination
2568391 in my view the strongest force of all one which grew and took fresh shapes and forms every day war the force not of any one individual but was that unmistakable sense of unanimity among the peoples of the world that war must somehow be averted the peoples of the british empire were at one with those of germany of france and of italy and their anxiety their intense desire for peace pervaded the whole atmosphere of the conference and i believe that that and not threats made possible the concessions that were made
2568392 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2568393 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2568394 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2568405 global warming has added an extra layer of anxiety to what people are already feeling
2568406 a more likely threat is the social upheaval that would be caused by an economic catastrophe triggered by the failure of the largest banks in america which are presently carrying huge loans that can never be repaid as assets most of the ten major banks in the us are technically bankrupt its really the emperors new clothes they would be legally bankrupt if they were honest and stopped treating these loans as assets
2568407 i would certainly not put any substantial funds in any bank today
2568408 the vietnam war was of course horribly wrong from the start but i think it may have taught us something valuable i think the message has certainly gotten through that you dont even begin to think about fighting a war unless your survival depends upon it fancy theories about falling dominoes wont do in the future
2568409 one of the notable things about the vietnam war was that it was manipulated in washington by hawk intellectuals who tried to fine tune reality like an advertising agency constantly inventing new jargon
2568410 i think the danger is not that authority will collapse but that finally in order to preserve itself authority will become very repressive
2568411 thats clever because you cant fault it but im not sure what it means
2568412 there are obviously elements in a war film that involve visual spectacle courage loyalty affection self sacrifice and adventure and these things tend to complicate any anti war message

2568465 the uk government is deeply concerned by the violence in georgia
2568466 the uk believes it is vital for leaderships on both sides to call for fighting to cease and for peace talks to start as soon as possible
2568467 there is a very serious danger that these clashes could develop into a wider conflict between russia and georgia it is vital for both countries to commit themselves to talks and cease fighting immediately
2568468 it is not really a question of us taking sides you have got to recognise that the ossetians are making their own political claims but at the same time south ossetia is internationally recognised as part of georgia no other country recognises its claims of independence
2568469 the danger here is that russia will make this into an extremely serious situation particularly now they are engaging directly with georgian forces
2568470 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2568471 tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone

2568507 modeling is a way for me to continue with my sport the hours are flexible and you can earn good money through photographic modeling and the catwalk
2568508 in this competitive marketplace you have to separate yourself from other athletes and the taboo of posing for playboy or modeling has started to wane

2568511 these documents supply further evidence if any were needed that the justice department authorized the cia to torture prisoners in its custody
2568512 the justice department twisted the law and in some cases ignored it altogether in order to permit interrogators to use barbaric methods that the u s once prosecuted as war crimes
2568513 harm lasting months or even years after the acts were inflicted upon the prisoners
2568514 while the documents released today do provide more information about the development and implementation of the bush administrations torture policies even a cursory glance at the documents shows that the administration continues to use national security as a shield to protect government officials from embarrassment criticism and possible criminal prosecution
2568515 it is clear to me from the review that ive undertaken that there is product choice for canadians there are plans you can select that have no charges for text messaging but you may have to make decisions on which provider you want to use
2568516 at the end of the day consumers will vote with their feet they will decide whose products they want to purchase

2568518 i think in the case of both companies theyve taken steps to deal with that issue
2568519 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction
2568520 the public life wore him pierce down and put a pessimistic streak in him that i was looking forward to see go away when the suits did alas he did not reach that point

2568524 we will not let those responsible for the death of our people go unpunished
2568525 one of the greatest piece of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know
2568526 a study 1975 1989 showed that portfolios that finished the first five years in the top quintile were actually the least likely to finish in the top half over the next five years
2568527 of the 50 top performing funds in 2000 not a single one appeard on the list in either 1999 or 1998
2568528 using past performance numbers as a method for choosing mutual funds is such a lousy idea that mutual fund companies are required by law to tell you it is a lousy idea

2568530 scotty bowman more than anyone in hockey today embodies the traits we are integrating into this organization in order to bring a stanley cup to chicago he symbolizes excellence performance work ethic and delivering results so do we

2568534 i think the situation of european heavy metal is pretty good
2568535 we came out of this quick turnaround really well that was two hard full pads practices back to back on friday afternoon and this morning it was like the old two a days except the tempo we go at now is so much faster than it was back then weve had a good first six days this one was one of the better works weve gotten in a long while
2568536 our defense has a lot of pride its mostly a lot of the older guys and theyre going to bounce back with blood in their eyes after the offense has the better of it
2568537 the defensive line really rose up today one difference was al smith had a good day because he got a lot more plays today we know what he can do and he proved it again he changes things up front then our linebackers were flying around and we had some good things happen in the secondary
2568538 you win that way the ball goes out of bounds its the offense going forward maybe for the winning score mack had some big hits for us too
2568539 hopefully the offense can get some consistency they had a good friday but they got handled pretty good this morning

2568630 all day and all night long he had a gun on each shoulder and he marched from where our store was to our home and that was back and forth all evening
2568631 its a history that has to be brought out into the open it really has to be
2568632 it is extremely important that we take time to recognize the significance of the race riots that we teach our children all about them
2568633 and that we rededicate ourselves to the notion that we must all work together to ensure that something like that never happens again
2568634 it wasnt a bad practice it just wasnt as clean and crisp relative to what weve had
2568635 there is always a lot we have to do but we got a lot of work done

2568644 in the beginning the church was a fellowship of men and women centering on the living christ then the church moved to greece where it became a philosophy then it moved to rome where it became an institution next it moved to europe where it became a culture and finally it moved to america where it became an enterprise
2568645 dear boy what do we know of the idea of the divine and what can our narrow conceptions presume to tell of the supreme being if i called him by a hundred names like a turk i should yet fall short and have said nothing in comparison to the boundlessness of his attributes
2568646 the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities we need men who can dream of things that never were
2568647 focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition it asks too little of yourself because its only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential
2568648 i count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who overcomes his enemies

2568661 and the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2568662 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2568663 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2568664 the more people who turn out the better it is for us and i hope they start cheering on the team from the start
2568665 there are enough days for the team to get adapted to the time here
2568666 hes a team player he knows he needs to improve and thats the fastest way to improve
2568667 we feel very comfortable with our running game but we just wanted to get our pass game off to a fresh start
2568668 i feel good i felt real comfortable its preseason im not doing a lot but i still felt comfortable out there

2568721 im not going to stop until i actually get there
2568722 our goal is to get them to the next level
2568723 we dont want them to play in another independent league
2568724 i bet if i asked them and told them we werent going to pay you or you had to pay us to play most of them would thats how much they love the game
2568725 they needed a little more leadership on and off the field
2568726 i stay there and control things and make sure nobody is getting into too much trouble or staying out too late we have fun but thats on off days im just making sure their heads are in the right place

2568732 but it wont be when im 30 if im still in the independent league at 26

2568734 earlier this year i was playing in front of 5 000 fans and packed houses
2568735 my dad was driving around trying to find a street and toros pitching coach jim mallory was mowing his lawn
2568736 my dad rolled down the window and asked where a certain street was
2568737 i cant remember the last time ive thrown six innings and havent walked anybody
2568738 i just wanted to play one more year see if i could do it and if scouts wanted me i had my one year i got what i wanted out of it i need to start real life and make some money

2568741 churches are looking at who they are in their worship identity as congregations shift in their musical tastes and appreciation church leaders are trying to match worship styles to whos in the pews now and who the church would like to see there
2568742 i thought that was just biblical living we minister the gospel and the gospel moves us to serve those around us and around the world
2568743 how well have we learned the lessons of the early church and of christs earthly ministry
2568744 the biblical historical and confessional truth is that buildings bodies and budgets are a very poor indicator of blessing on the basis of the killer bs we should never have left the roman catholic communion for she had all the bs
2568745 if we seek to engage in ordinary means of grace ministry or engage in the parish model of ministry then should we not seek more churches in more places meeting the needs of their particular area rather than large churches that fall well within the parameters of success as defined by
2568746 we are doing ministry when we keep building monuments to our budgets in terms of increasingly large and ornate edifices

2568755 i still think the teacher acted irresponsibly i think the fact that the kids were keen is irrelevant they are children and any protest is likely to be quite exciting to join
2568756 i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it
2568757 oh they cant be trusted to have a brain until theyre 16 stuff is utter poppycock

2568759 as i said the issue isnt whether you believe alternatives to be correct or not the opportunity to study them helps you understand science rather than just rote learning the currently popular story of the past from a book
2568760 school and university does not generally encourage assessment of alternative views which is vital to a detailed understanding of science

2568762 clearly some are appropriate and some inappropriate for school kids
2568763 i would trust the combined sense held by the teacher supporting parents and the children themselves not to get involved in anything harmful wouldnt you
2568764 i would trust the combined sense held by the teacher supporting parents and the children themselves not to let the children be use as partisan political tools wouldnt you
2568765 clearly teachers permitting kids who wanted to write a petition to their local city council about a plan to remove a playground thats near school would be appropriate
2568766 clearly to you its about what they want as long as what they want is what you want
2568767 the students who had intended to go to see the house debate were denied entry to the parliamentary gallery after joining the protest
2568768 your critical thinking has has remarkably permitted you to decide that modern geology biology biochemisty paleontology biophysics etc etc is completely mistaken
2568769 so youre going to champion the teaching of alchemy then as an alternative to chemistry

2568841 por tanto se denuncia al estado y al gobierno de chile por no escuchar y hacer caso omiso a nuestras peticiones para evitar la construcci n de la carretera en nuestros espacios sagrados y la incapacidad de solucionar los graves problemas existentes en los diferentes territorios de nuestro pueblo
2568842 dejamos claro que no es tozudez de parte nuestra sino de los que provocan por cuanto anteriormente hab amos invitado a la autoridad comunal y gobierno regional a conversar en el espacio ceremonial rewe weicha el d a s bado 2 de agosto a las 13 00 horas no acudiendo ninguna de las autoridades mencionadas

2568859 if they dont water the greens during the day as i think they did on thursday the greens were pretty hard and firm and fast at 9 oclock so theyre going to be really firm and fast by 2 30 or 4 oclock
2568860 this is probably the toughest course ive ever played the rough is high and even if youre a good driver youre going to miss four fairways and the greens are tricky youre always putting up slopes
2568861 but somebodys going to enjoy it by the end of the week

2568878 everybody got a lot of opportunities to move up the depth chart our receivers did not catch the ball like theyve been catching it in practice but we have a young group of receivers and unfortunately thats what happens sometimes when its showtime the young guys cant get it done so weve got to give these guys opportunities where they feel like its game experience

2568909 it is wrong to assume that on the one hand there is a word or a truth and on the other hand there is a community existing as two separate entities and that it would then be the task of the preacher to take this word to manipulate and enliven it in order to bring it within and apply it to the community rather the word moves along this path of its own accord the preacher should and can do nothing more than be a servant of this movement inherent in the word itself and refrain from placing obstacles in its path

2568911 the dollar is in my view in a genuine recovery this trend could run much further than many think
2568912 honey theres something i have to tell you im a vorarephile
2568913 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2568914 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2568915 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2568916 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2568917 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2568918 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2568919 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2568920 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

2568923 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2568924 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2568925 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2568926 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2568927 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2568928 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2568929 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2568930 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2568931 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2568932 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2568933 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2568934 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2568935 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2568936 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2568937 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
2568938 bitch a homebirth is safer than going to a hospital thats going to give me tons of unneeded medical interventions for some extra cash

2568956 it may have delayed her eventual demise probably slow the cancer down but eventually she would have succumbed to this vicious cancer
2568957 the point here is that the primary tumor was treated
2568958 the bottom line is it probably does happen obviously it happens very rarely because it is the nature of cancer to grow not to regress
2568959 for the true believer or faithful this is a miracle for the true skeptic this is a random or very unusual coincidence for the doctor and scientist we call it complete spontaneous regression of cancer
2568960 im not the praying type but i just wanted to say thank you

2569005 abkhazia will propose to russia the signing of a military treaty that would guarantee security to our republic
2569006 we are also prepared to host russian military bases on our territory within the framework of this treaty i would like to emphasize that this would not go against the precedents already existing in international practice for instance this treaty could be analogous to the treaty between the us and taiwan

2569016 well done on a first pitch and a first time film maker it was extremely well done your personality comes through youve got multiple different types of stories and its something everyone can relate to
2569017 what i like about it also is that it has multi media components as well it has the website and a lot of channels my channel in particular like to do programming extensions on our website clearly there are tie ins for that its a universal story its something everyone can identify with also and i have to say i could totally see you on oprah

2569028 its absolutely a critical time said don waller a uw madison professor of botany who has served in the past on the arboretum committee and stays abreast of issues
2569029 i remember thinking wow what are all these trees doing in the middle of the city meine said
2569030 this place is special because of the leopold connection and because it is the birthplace of restoration ecology
2569031 our idea in a nutshell is to reconstruct primarily for the use of the university a sample of original wisconsin a sample of what dane county looked like when our ancestors arrived here during the 1840s
2569032 our mission is to conserve and restore arboretum lands advance restoration ecology and foster the land ethic
2569033 are we a visitor center or are we a research and science facility or are we for public recreation
2569034 will be done for research rather than for amusement and for use by the university rather than for use by the town
2569035 my personal perspective is that people have been coming here for a long time and they are not going to go away
2569036 and in the tradition of the wisconsin idea it is our obligation to provide a diverse array of outreach programs from gardening classes to nature camps for kids its a way we can convey to people why we do what we do and that values of the natural world
2569037 is an admission that science does not yet know enough or is not yet sufficiently listened to to anticipate and prevent this process of wreckage which attends our supposedly advancing footsteps
2569038 this is an outstanding event and an opportunity for the men of our city and state to show that they are caring fathers to their children and are prepared to accept their responsibilities as role models
2569039 strong families include strong fathers who in turn produce academically proficient and socially developed children who are a valuable asset to their communities
2569040 yes we promised to provide free access to the internet except for a few that would jeopardize our national security and would not be good for the healthy growth of our young people
2569041 as in any other country there are some kinds of limitations
2569042 however i think we are going to provide sufficient access for the media to cover the games
2569043 sites that you need to have for your job its important that you raise them for bocogs awareness
2569044 the censorship situation for those web sites has not loosened at all
2569045 furthermore plans unless specifically designated for tethering usage cannot be used for any applications that tether the device through use of including without limitation connection kits other phone pda to computer accessories bluetooth or any other wireless technology to personal computers including without limitation laptops or other equipment for any purpose
2569046 from what i can tell their approval process is not very strict at all
2569047 its more technical than content related is what it seems like to us i think they run it start it up and if it doesnt crash they approve it they brainlessly click through and if theres problems they remove it is what it seems like
2569048 theyre shooting themselves in the foot these days theyre probably just understaffed

2569074 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2569075 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2569076 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate cease fire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2569077 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2569078 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2569079 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2569080 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack

2569087 im sure they are going to sell a lot of second generation iphones its a fantastic product but they cant take over the united states with just one carrier
2569088 it does seem like apple has missed an obvious opportunity to allow users more ways to purchase music
2569089 in exchange for paying a premium for its ipod and iphone devices sources told cnet news com that the music labels would agree if apple shared revenue on device sales so far nothing has come of it
2569090 apples model is to get you to buy a bigger device every 18 months or two years
2569091 you fill up your ipod you go oh im going to buy the new ipod with twice as much memory in a subscription world the size of your device matters a lot less cause you can swap out the content in a world like that the consumer has a lot less incentive to buy a bigger device
2569092 the one lesson you can take away from microsoft is that once you attract the developers the rest is an easy coast downhill and im incredibly impressed at the speed in which apples application development platform has matured
2569093 in two months we were able to make the best version of loopt weve ever created its taken us nearly a year to create other versions of our software
2569094 the underlying software platform for the iphone is much more powerful than any other mobile device weve seen
2569095 it just makes it much easier for us to show off all our multimedia content like videos and pictures its more challenging on other platforms
2569096 the quality of mobile applications for the iphone is just so much better
2569097 some of these menus are pretty deep and theyre difficult to navigate
2569098 i think the pc is the most powerful interface to browse content anyway so it makes sense to use it
2569099 fifteen years ago you didnt find sex workers in remote areas and cities but now its prevalent in every city every county
2569100 estimates of the number of prostitutes in china vary widely from 1 million who earn their primary income from sex to eight or 10 times that including people who sometimes accept money gifts or rent in exchange for sex that the numbers have been allowed to increase illustrates the tricky relationship officials have with the ancient profession
2569101 but as far as foreigners go the sex industry is largely confined to three red light bar areas sanlitun hohai and lidu in beijing staffed almost wholly by chinese women
2569102 there are lady bars in the districts mentioned above but the bars are rip off joints aimed at tourists it is a quasi japanese hostess style affair where the man picks a girl buys her drinks she earns commission on these and pays for her time then pays a lot more if they want sex
2569103 he felt the pulse of palestinians in beautiful poetry he was a mirror of the palestinian society
2569104 he started out as a poet of resistance and then he became a poet of conscience
2569105 he embodied the best in palestinians even though he became iconic he never lost his sense of humanity we have lost part of our essence the essence of the palestinian being
2569106 when we think of darwish he is our heart and our tongue
2569107 he created a national palestinian identity that no other poet could achieve
2569108 i should be able to go once i get outside and run around and loosen up
2569109 the best way to get him some work and get him sharp and get his arm strength up and get him back to pitching shape is by getting him some work in the middle
2569110 the secret here is to get him healthy entirely and get him pitching and keep him healthy
2569111 if you look at how soon he would be able to be in the rotation there is some sense to getting him in the bullpen sooner
2569112 he was just about how i expected him to be
2569113 i told memphis pitching coach blaise ilsley before he pitched that he would probably not be very effective its only the second time hes faced hitters hes going to have to get his feet on the ground
2569114 i think hell be a lot better next time out
2569115 and then the time after that he should be improved from that well see how he is if we think that hes progressed to the point where he could pitch up here wed probably bring him up here and pitch him the middle a couple of times get him five or six total appearances and hopefully hed be where we want him to be
2569116 the genius of this is that its completely reusable they have attacks that let them load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions
2569117 this stuff just takes a knife to a large part of the security mesh microsoft built into vista
2569118 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks
2569119 this is not insanely technical these two guys are capable of the really low level technical attacks but this is simple and reusable
2569120 since these techniques do not rely on any one specific vulnerability zovi believes that we may suddenly see many similar techniques applied to other platforms or environments
2569121 load chosen content to a chosen location with chosen permissions
2569122 if you think about the fact that net loads dlls into the browser itself and then microsoft assumes theyre safe because theyre net objects you see that microsoft didnt think about the idea that these could be used as stepping stones for other attacks this is a real tour de force

2569127 there was once this person who brought change to cuba
2569128 in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an american and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace or origin but this is predicated upon the persons becoming in every facet an american and nothing but an american there can be no divided allegiance here any man who says he is an american but something else also isnt an american at all we have room for but one flag the american flag we have room for but one language here and that is the english language and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the american people
2569129 may day the day which inspires fear in the hearts of the capitalists and hope in the workers the workers the world over will find the communist movement this year stronger in the u s than at any time in its history the road is clear for greater achievements and in the united states as elsewhere in the world the future belongs to communism
2569130 if mayor richard m daley does not take the bull by the horns and clean up the city of chicagos corrupt and apparently often phony affirmative action program he could threaten the existence of affirmative action nationally affirmative action is great for black millionaires but it has done little or nothing for most people in the ghetto most minority business owners who get preferences in government contracts have net worths of more than one million dollars
2569131 it seems that totalitarianism is the only possible end result of egalitarianism
2569132 men are not born equal in any physical sense trying to make them so can only be achieved by reducing everyone to the lowest common denominator
2569133 in the field of microeconomics whether equity is achieved is a major criterion of whether a given policy is succesful
2569134 you cant be libertarian and left wing this is almost exclusively an american response overlooking the undoubtedly libertarian tradition of european anarcho syndicalism it was after all the important french anarchist thinker proudhon who declared that property is theft on the other side of the atlantic the likes of emma goldman were identified as libertarians long before the term was adopted by some economic rightwingers and what about the libertarian collectives of the mid late 1800s and 1960s americans like noam chomsky can claim the label libertarian socialist with the same validity that milton friedman can be considered a libertarian capitalist the assumption that social darwinism delivers more social freedom is questionable the welfare states of for example sweden and the netherlands abolished capital punishment decades ago and are at the forefront of progressive legislation for women gays and ethnic minorities not to mention anti censorship such established social democracies consistently score highest in the widely respected freedom house annual survey on civil liberties their detailed checklist can be viewed at http www worldaudit org civillibs htm such social developments would presumably be envied by genuine libertarians in socially conservative countries even if their taxes are lower interestingly many economic libertarians express to us their support for or indifference towards capital punishment yet the execution of certain citizens is a far stronger assertion of state power than taxation n b the death penalty is practised in all seriously authoritarian states in eastern europe it was abolished with the fall of communism and adoption of democracy the united states is the only western democracy where capital punishment is still practised
2569135 hitler and stalin were both authoritarians margaret thatcher and george bush are also authoritarians although arguably not as extreme as the preceding leaders
2569136 a tax which is grievous to be borne and is not this our affliction great now behold how great reason we have to mourn
2569137 i pahoran do not seek for power save only to retain my judgment seat that i may preserve the rights and the liberty of my people my soul standeth fast in that liberty in which god hath made us free and now behold we will resist wickedness even unto bloodshed we would not shed the blood of the lamanites if they would stay in their own land we would not shed the blood of our brethren if they would not rise in rebellion and take the sword against us therefore let us resist evil and whatsoever evil we cannot resist with our words yea such as rebellions and dissensions let us resist them with our swords that we may retain our freedom that we may rejoice in the great privilege of our church and in the cause of our redeemer and our god
2569138 therefore if it were possible that you could have just men to be your kings who would establish the laws of god and judge this people according to his commandments yea if ye could have men for your kings who would do even as my father benjamin did for this people i say unto you if this could always be the case then it would be expedient that ye should always have kings to rule over you
2569139 now i say unto you that because all men are not just it is not expedient that ye should have a king or kings to rule over you
2569140 and behold now i say unto you ye cannot dethrone an iniquitous king save it be through much contention and the shedding of much blood
2569141 for behold he has his friends in iniquity and he keepeth his guards about him and he teareth up the laws of those who have reigned in righteousness before him and he trampleth under his feet the commandments of god
2569142 and he enacteth laws and sendeth them forth among his people yea laws after the manner of his own wickedness and whosoever doth not obey his laws he causeth to be destroyed and whosoever doth rebel against him he will send his armies against them to war and if he can he will destroy them and thus an unrighteous king doth pervert the ways of all righteousness
2569143 now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law to do your business by the voice of the people
2569144 16 and it came to pass that i nephi beheld that the gentiles who had gone forth out of captivity american colonists did humble themselves before the lord and the power of the lord was with them 17 and i beheld that their mother gentiles england were gathered together upon the waters and upon the land also to battle against them the war of independence 18 and i beheld that the power of god was with them and also that the wrath of god was upon all those that were gathered together against them to battle 19 and i nephi beheld that the gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered by the power of god out of the hands of all other nations
2569145 when there shall be great spiritual pollutions upon the face of the earth there shall be murders and robbing and lying and deceivings and whoredoms and all manner of abominations when there shall be many who will say do this or do that and it mattereth not for the lord will uphold such at the last day yea it shall come in a day when there shall be churches built up that shall say come unto me and for your money you shall be forgiven of your sins
2569146 w hatsoever nation shall uphold such secret combinations to get power and gain until they shall spread over the nation behold they shall be destroyed for the lord will not suffer that the blood of his saints which shall be shed by them shall always cry unto him from the ground for vengeance upon them and yet he avenge them not wherefore o ye gentiles it is wisdom in god that these things should be shown unto you that thereby ye may repent of your sins and suffer not that these murderous combinations shall get above you which are built up to get power and gain and the work yea even the work of destruction come upon you yea even the sword of the justice of the eternal god shall fall upon you to your overthrow and destruction if ye shall suffer these things to be wherefore the lord commandeth you when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation because of this secret combination which shall be among you or wo be unto it because of the blood of them who have been slain for they cry from the dust for vengeance upon it and also upon those who built it up for it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up seeketh to overthrow the freedom of all lands nations and countries and it bringeth to pass the destruction of all people
2569147 and now as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just yea it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword or anything else which had happened unto them therefore alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of god
2569148 16 and it came to pass that i nephi beheld that the gentiles who had gone forth out of captivity did humble themselves before the lord and the power of the lord was with them 17 and i beheld that their mother gentiles england were gathered together upon the waters and upon the land also to battle against them 18 and i beheld that the power of god was with them and also that the wrath of god was upon all those that were gathered together against them to battle 19 and i nephi beheld that the gentiles that had gone out of captivity were delivered by the power of god out of the hands of all other nations
2569149 and he did fight with the strength of his own arm with the sword of laban
2569150 was a holy man and he did reign over his people in righteousness
2569151 12 i say unto you that as i have been suffered to spend my days in your service even up to this time and have not sought gold nor silver nor any manner of riches of you 13 neither have i suffered that ye should be confined in dungeons nor that ye should make slaves of another nor that ye should murder or plunder or steal or commit adultery nor even have i suffered that ye should commit any manner of wickedness and have taught you that ye should keep the commandments of the lord in all things which he has commanded you 14 and even i myself have labored with my own hands that i might serve you and that ye should not be laden with taxes and that there should nothing come upon you which was grievous to be borne and all of these things which i have spoken ye yourselves are witnesses this day
2569152 if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land
2569153 and is not this our affliction great now behold how great reason we have to mourn
2569154 and now all the study if ammon and his people and king limhi and his people was to deliver themselves out of the hands of the lamanites and from bondage
2569155 and now it came to pass that ammon and king limhi began to consult with the people how they should deliver themselves out of bondage and even they did cause that all the people should gather themselves together and this they did that they might have the voice of the people concerning the matter
2569156 the people were desirous that alma should be their king
2569157 if it were possible that ye could always have just men to be your kings it would be well for you to have a king
2569158 and now as ye have been delivered by the power of god out of these bonds i desire that ye would stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been made free and that ye trust no man to be a king over you
2569159 therefore if it were possible that you could have just men to be your kings who would establish the laws of god and judge this people according to his commandments yea if ye could have men for your kings who would do even as my father benjamin did for this people i say unto you if this could always be the case then it would be expedient that ye should always have kings to rule over you
2569160 now i say unto you that because all men are not just it is not expedient that ye should have a king or kings to rule over you
2569161 and behold now i say unto you ye cannot dethrone an iniquitous king save it be through much contention and the shedding of much blood
2569162 for behold he has his friends in iniquity and he keepeth his guards about him and he teareth up the laws of those who have reigned in righteousness before him and he trampleth under his feet the commandments of god
2569163 and he enacteth laws and sendeth them forth among his people yea laws after the manner of his own wickedness and whosoever doth not obey his laws he causeth to be destroyed and whosoever doth rebel against him he will send his armies against them to war and if he can he will destroy them and thus an unrighteous king doth pervert the ways of all righteousness
2569164 now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law to do your business by the voice of the people
2569165 and now i desire that this inequality should be no more in this land especially among this people but i desire that this land be a land of liberty and every man may enjoy his rights and privileges alike so long as the lord sees fit that we may live and inherit the land
2569166 for the sole purpose to get gain they did stir up the people into riotings and all manner of disturbances and wickedness that they might have more employ that they might get money according to the suits which were brought before them
2569167 t he preaching of the word had a greater tendency to lead the people to do that which was just yea it had had more powerful effect on the minds of the people than the sword or anything else
2569168 to support the cause of freedom that they might maintain a free government
2569169 sworn with an oath to defend his people his rights and his country and his religion even to the loss of his blood
2569170 an oath and sacred ordinance to judge righteously and to keep the peace and the freedom of the people and to grant unto them their sacred privileges to worship the lord their god yea to support and maintain the cause of god all his days and to bring the wicked to justice according to their crime
2569171 in a manner to overthrow the free government and to establish a king over the land
2569172 delivering their women and their children from famine and affliction and providing food for their armies
2569173 i pahoran do not seek for power save only to retain my judgment seat that i may preserve the rights and the liberty of my people my soul standeth fast in that liberty in which god hath made us free and now behold we will resist wickedness even unto bloodshed we would not shed the blood of the lamanites if they would stay in their own land we would not shed the blood of our brethren if they would not rise in rebellion and take the sword against us therefore let us resist evil and whatsoever evil we cannot resist with our words yea such as rebellions and dissensions let us resist them with our swords that we may retain our freedom that we may rejoice in the great privilege of our church and in the cause of our redeemer and our god
2569174 and thus it became expedient that this law should be strictly observed for the safety of their country yea and whosoever was found denying their freedom was speedily executed according to the law
2569175 and they had all things in common among them therefore there were not rich and poor bond and free but they were all made free and partakers of the heavenly gift
2569176 the judgments of god will overtake the wicked and it is by the wicked that the wicked are punished for it is the wicked that stir up the hearts of the children of men unto bloodshed
2569177 when there shall be great spiritual pollutions upon the face of the earth there shall be murders and robbing and lying and deceivings and whoredoms and all manner of abominations when there shall be many who will say do this or do that and it mattereth not for the lord will uphold such at the last day yea it shall come in a day when there shall be churches built up that shall say come unto me and for your money you shall be forgiven of your sins
2569178 put to death every nephite that will not deny the christ
2569179 to refrain from contracting any marriages forbidden by the law of the land
2569180 t he coming conflict between same sex marriage and religious liberty
2569181 we have encountered a dilemma we cannot resolve the issue is adoption to same sex couples
2569182 even if catholic charities ceased receiving tax support and gave up its role as a state contractor it still could not refuse to place children with same sex couples
2569183 the impact will be severe and pervasive this is going to affect every aspect of church state relations the church is surrounded on all sides by the state that church and state butt up against each other the boundaries are usually peaceful so its easy sometimes to forget they are there but because marriage affects just about every area of the law gay marriage is going to create a point of conflict at every point around the perimeter
2569184 i t is not only gay marriage but also the set of ideas that leads to gay marriage the insistence on one specific vision of gay rights that has placed church and state on a collision course once sexual orientation is conceptualized as a protected status on a par with race traditional religions that condemn homosexual conduct will face increasing legal pressures regardless of what courts and congress do about marriage itself
2569185 the government will force religious schools to tolerate both conduct and proclamations by students they believe to be sinful
2569186 what of a church affiliated community center with a gym and a little league that offers family programs must a religious affiliated family services provider offer marriage counseling to same sex couples designed to facilitate or preserve their relationships future conflict with the law in regard to licensing is certain with regard to psychological clinics social workers marital counselors and the like
2569187 people who favor gay rights face no penalty for speaking their views but can inflict a risk of litigation investigation and formal and informal career penalties on others whose views they dislike meanwhile people who think gay marriage is wrong cannot know for sure where the line is now or where it will be redrawn in the near future soft coercion produces no martyrs to disturb anyones conscience yet it is highly effective in chilling the speech of ordinary people
2569188 religious groups that take government funding will almost certainly be required to play by the nondiscrimination rules but what about groups that while receiving no government grants are tax exempt
2569189 a concerted effort to take same sex marriage from a negative right to be free of state interference to a positive entitlement to assistance by others
2569190 given the status of most churches as state nonprofits and federally tax exempt organizations it is likely that public support arguments will be advanced to compel churches to participate in same sex marriage
2569191 any organization that engaged in such discrimination as a matter of faith would be in a position similar to bob jones university
2569192 what does it matter what we do in the privacy of our own bedrooms
2569193 your children must be taught in school in a completely amoral context what our sexual behavior is and how it defines us as individuals
2569194 in this country there are thousands of laws that restrict our personal freedoms for the sake of protecting our society marriage is no different
2569195 furthermore a ban on gay marriage is not discriminatory everyone is being treated the same in that we are all free to marry an adult of the opposite sex to say that it discriminates against those who dont want to marry the opposite sex is like saying youre being discriminated against when theres no one you want to vote for on the ballot at election time people who choose not to avail themselves of certain rights are not being discriminated against
2569196 recognize gay marriage whats next recognizing polygamous pedophilic and incestual marriages
2569197 oh dont be rediculous use common sense theres no evidence that one will lead to another youre just being a bigot whats next banning interracial marriage
2569198 funny how the slippery slope rule is immmediately invalidated by liberals except when they exercise it in reverse
2569199 my familiarity with a gay couple will not alleviate the threat to religious liberty represented by the agenda of the gay lobby not any individual person who chooses to engage in same gender sexual activities
2569200 as it happens i have had friendships and working relationships with individuals from both gay and lesbian relationships individuals with whom i got along with very easily and liked and cared for a great deal as individuals i have never condoned or approved of their lifestyle choices but they have never personally made an issue or otherwise confronted me about it and i have extended them the same courtesy
2569201 regardless of all the above my point is and will remain that the agenda of the gay lobby is a threat to one of the founding constitutional liberties
2569202 if you took the time to read the article i referenced you will note that it is the more liberal more pro gay legal experts who forsee the coming collision of gay marriage and religious liberty concern over the erosion of constitutional liberties cannot be fairly summarized as bigotry
2569203 frankly peter im disappointed at your response ive summarized the consensus of a variety of legal experts and examined historical legal actions taken by the government in regards to the enforcement of their recognized definition of marriage and your response other than downplaying the slippery slope argument and then using it yourself in reverse your response is high emotion low on reason
2569204 i realize that as an agnostic a loss of religious liberty may not seem all that alarming but consider the precendent set the next time some other founding constitutional liberty is thrown out to fit the self seeking agenda of some other group what happens if its a liberty near and dear to your heart
2569205 what does the future of integrated marketing and communications look like
2569206 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2569207 we urge the georgian authorities to immediately stop their aggression against south ossetia to stop all violations of all standing agreements on a ceasefire and to respect the legal rights and interests of other people
2569208 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2569209 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2569210 the town is destroyed there are many casualties many wounded

2569230 he reminded me that the state wide short film competition for
2569231 lately he had been working on effects shots for some disney music videos we are working on choo choo soul and a commercial we were doing for trix cereal look for it soon
2569232 rob is also a talented film maker with his own hd camera setup we made some calls and we were off it was a crazy few days as rob amp i shot all over town we had a lot of help from our friends tim clark worked magic amp we were given permission to shoot under the falls and at a bisons game thanks mike a good friend and client of ours roger trevino helped us get helicopter ride over the falls to film nick pitillo and jillian fiorella rolled out the red carpet for us at the seneca casino in niagara falls it was a crazy experience but we got it in the can

2569235 and it is a lucky thing i am not for my mouth is only painted and if i should cut a hole in it so i could eat the straw i am stuffed with would come out and that would spoil the shape of my head
2569236 tell me something about yourself and the country you came from
2569237 i cannot understand why you should wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry gray place you call kansas
2569238 no matter how dreary and gray our homes are we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country be it ever so beautiful there is no place like home
2569239 if your heads were stuffed with straw like mine you would probably all live in the beautiful places and then kansas would have no people at all it is fortunate for kansas that you have brains
2569240 wont you tell me a story while we are resting
2569241 my life has been so short that i really know nothing whatever
2569242 this fellow will scare the crows fast enough said the
2569243 why he is a man said the other and i quite agreed with him
2569244 i did not like to be deserted this way so i tried to walk
2569245 i wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy
2569246 i felt sad at this for it showed i was not such a good
2569247 after the crows had gone i thought this over and decided i would try hard to get some brains by good luck you came along and pulled me off the stake and from what you say i am sure the great oz will give me brains as soon as we get to the emerald city
2569248 it is such an uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool
2569249 and as the emerald city is at the other end of the road we must go wherever it leads us
2569250 if it required brains to figure it out i never should have said it
2569251 if you see any house or any place where we can pass the night
2569252 you must tell me for it is very uncomfortable walking in the dark
2569253 i see a little cottage at the right of us
2569254 ill play until i cant or until im told to get a real job
2569255 if i sit normal i wont be able to walk
2569256 i finally feel like im getting back to my old self
2569257 i love the game so much ill play until i cant crawl out of bed anymore
2569258 im not going to stop until i actually get there
2569259 our goal is to get them to the next level
2569260 we dont want them to play in another independent league
2569261 i bet if i asked them and told them we werent going to pay you or you had to pay us to play most of them would thats how much they love the game
2569262 they needed a little more leadership on and off the field
2569263 i stay there and control things and make sure nobody is getting into too much trouble or staying out too late we have fun but thats on off days im just making sure their heads are in the right place
2569264 thats why im so eager to get back ive been there and i want to get back
2569265 i went 3 for 3 2 for 3 and 0 for 4 in the series
2569266 thats a day ill never forget but its also a day i would love to put behind me
2569267 i figure in order to be successful you have to fail at some point this is my test
2569268 theres no doubt in my mind i will be in the big leagues whether its this year next year or the year after that
2569269 but it wont be when im 30 if im still in the independent league at 26
2569270 look at where you are at now and where you want to be and thats motivation enough to get there
2569271 earlier this year i was playing in front of 5 000 fans and packed houses
2569272 my dad was driving around trying to find a street and toros pitching coach jim mallory was mowing his lawn
2569273 my dad rolled down the window and asked where a certain street was
2569274 i cant remember the last time ive thrown six innings and havent walked anybody
2569275 i just wanted to play one more year see if i could do it and if scouts wanted me i had my one year i got what i wanted out of it i need to start real life and make some money

2569281 player of the year as he sat on the bench suffering from dehydration immaculatas theo riddick knew he had to take matters into his own hands
2569282 he didnt play most of the third quarter and almost the entire fourth quarter
2569283 he was drinking a lot of water he was beat
2569284 i was on the bench and i felt the momentum shifting i asked my trainer if it was okay to go in and he said yes
2569285 by the end of our third scrimmage this year we had seen enough to know that he was going to be a special player
2569286 you dont see a guy explode like that at any level
2569287 going into the game we knew we had to stop him

2569376 as president alan evans must accept responsibility for the groups failure to publicly disclose on time how much money the organisation donated to the labor and coalition parties mr evans should explain if the group made a mistake or if there was an attempt to cover up the 225 000 in donations either way the law has been broken and alan evans needs to accept responsibility
2569377 we have an obligation to be involved in the political process in order to advance the interests of our members
2569378 it is important to note that we do not donate money to political parties instead we purchase tables at political functions and events that are attended by members of parliament at both a state and federal level
2569379 internally we have a set of rules that govern this process namely that what we give to one side of politics we give to another in order to ensure fairness and that we only attend those events at which there are representatives from the areas of relevance to our members
2569380 unfortunately this is a reality of being involved in the political process today
2569381 money given at fundraisers flows into the coffers of the major parties and buys influence just like direct donations what mr evans is admitting to is the potential money brings to bend the ears of mps at swanky fund raising events who knows whether nrma members are happy with their money being handed over by alan evans to political parties
2569382 the nrma has no reason to not disclose its political contributions and took steps to ensure its obligation was met

2569390 we have unrealistic expectations for people john edwards like the rest of us is only human
2569391 the truth is a lot of ordinary average americans have affairs
2569392 weve got one of the ablest candidates ever nominated and hes running against a man who really pretty much promises more of the same of what weve had the last eight years
2569393 i think its entirely up to senator edwards and his wife and the rest of us should keep quiet
2569394 the edwards family indicated that they probably wouldnt be attending the convention
2569395 this is a difficult and painful time for them and i think they need to work through that process of healing
2569396 many of his themes are ones that democrats as a whole share those will be amplified in the convention

2569451 international atomic energy agency director general mohamed elbaradei has dismissed tougher sanctions against iran as ineffective in an interview
2569452 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2569453 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2569454 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2569455 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2569456 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2569457 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2569458 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2569459 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2569460 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2569461 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2569462 im going to get up early and set off before the others tomorrow in an effort not to slow them down
2569463 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2569464 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2569465 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2569466 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2569467 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2569468 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2569469 marks injury is not as bad as a lot of people feared it was so well take the reps until he gets back and well see what happens then
2569470 im happy for mark that the injury is not as serious as it could have been
2569471 but my thinking hasnt changed at all im still going to compete for first team reps
2569472 its the same kind of opportunity just shortened a little i guess
2569473 im hoping mine will be like all the shorter ones i heard
2569474 i woke up and thought i was in a bad dream
2569475 i was like no and then it all sunk back in and i was like man but it could be a lot worse i should be thankful
2569476 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2569477 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2569478 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2569479 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2569480 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2569481 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2569482 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2569483 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2569484 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2569485 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2569486 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2569487 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2569488 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2569489 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2569490 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2569491 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2569492 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2569493 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2569494 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2569495 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2569496 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2569497 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2569498 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2569499 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location

2569501 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2569502 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2569503 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2569504 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2569505 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2569506 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2569507 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2569508 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2569509 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2569510 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2569511 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2569512 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2569513 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2569514 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2569515 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2569516 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2569517 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2569518 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2569519 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2569520 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2569521 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2569522 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2569523 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2569524 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2569525 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2569526 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2569527 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2569528 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2569529 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

2569573 i am struck by how lyme disease never seems to act exactly the way it is supposed to how each individual seems to respond differently to the spirochete
2569574 lyme is an enigma while the debate rages over proper diagnostic and treatment procedures patients get sicker and some even die
2569575 because the symptoms can be so varied and are often so vague borreliosis is typically not even considered for testing or treatment
2569576 it is possible for the deer tick to be infected with multiple pathogens i e b burgdorferi b microti and the ehrlichia sp of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis therefore medical providers should be aware that co infection may occur
2569577 we conclude that the treatment of lyme borreliosis with appropriate antibiotics for even more than 3 months may not always eradicate the spirochete
2569578 with the pathogenesis of lyme disease still unclear the truth is that mainstream experts have imposed a rigid template on an entity they dont fully understand because their studies flow from the disease definition rather than the other way around they have generated information about a disease model but not the disease itself
2569579 neurologic lyme disease is very different than lyme arthritis and one way its different is that its somewhat harder to diagnose
2569580 both doctors and patients are realizing that despite the growing recognition of lyme disease it is still a political football
2569581 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed its the only thing that ever has
2569582 letters to the editor are impossible to overuse we clip them and circulate them through the office like gossip sheets of whats going on the press represents an overall buzz in the community
2569583 basically every aspect of this illness is highly controversial from diagnosis because the symptoms can be so variable and because current laboratory testing is widely accepted to be poor to definition of
2569584 these chronic lyme disease patients are in a condition worse than patients with marked congestive heart failure they are two and a half standard deviations from normal among the most deviant of any chronic illness
2569585 10 15 of those with the lyme bacteria progress to chronic lyme disease
2569586 giving up is not an option it never will be so i keep fighting and maybe one day ill find my way to health again
2569587 treating lyme disease effectively especially cases in which the bb pathogen has diseminated throughout the body involves a comprehensive knowledgeable approach that integrates the best of both conventional and alternative medicine
2569588 i have said to the court ini fitnah khianat that was the term i used when saying that i am innocent theres an attempt to blemish my character i am grateful alhamdulillah that azizah my family and friends and you are firm courageous to ensure there is a change in this country

2569786 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2569787 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2569788 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
