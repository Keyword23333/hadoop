8040000 in anaheim i thought it was going to be a good opportunity but i just didnt fit into the mode there with ice time playing 10 to 12 minutes a game its kind of hard to perform
8040001 we were over there and they were taking pictures and the only time ive seen this was in l a when we got on a red carpet once in a while not at the rink
8040002 i said to todd does this remind you of vancouver a little bit he said yeah here we go again
8040003 i havent played a home game on canadian soil since i was 16 years old so i think the whole idea of canadians knowledge of the game their love their passion for the sport is how i grew up
8040004 im just gonna come in and put myself in a good position to be successful with my conditioning this team has been there right from the past five six seven years
8040005 the democratic party represents a much better future for everything we care about i will be making a strong case that we must stand behind our nominees
8040006 we cant afford four more years of a republican in the white house
8040007 this initiative is part of microsofts antipiracy campaign dubbed windows genuine advantage wga aimed at educating users on the benefits of using genuine software
8040008 its a very definite chilling affect on free speech its definitely a chilling affect on peoples rights to document whats happening around them
8040009 if they persist in keeping our equipment and get away with it its definitely a victory for corruption of police
8040010 does it happen at all that people pull out at the last minute
8040011 quite often i go home again and a new appointment is made but in many cases the patient passes away between visits
8040012 can i just ask you something is there still a lot you feel you need to do
8040013 i can always come back later if you are not ready
8040014 were being treated by the city of denver and the secret service like political prisoners like pariahs
8040015 were going to stay here for just a couple of minutes to state our disgust with this abomination the way the city and secret service are tearing the constitution of the united states to shreds and then we will leave
8040016 this is a matter of grave concern to the united nations
8040017 it is vital that the international and afghan military forces thoroughly review the conduct of this operation in order to prevent a repeat of this tragic incident
8040018 foreign and afghan military personnel entered the village of nawabad in the azizabad area of shindand district
8040019 military operations lasted several hours during which air strikes were called in
8040020 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
8040021 according to the villagers their enemies give false report to americans that foreign fighters were gathering in the village
8040022 i cant blame the afghan national army for the incident as they had no authority for leading the operation
8040023 it is cautious to assume a significant proportion will fail
8040024 such a warning from the environment agency must be taken extremely seriously the failure of just one container could prove catastrophic
8040025 absence of robust arguments which demonstrate that this target is achievable in practice
8040026 that are not expected to be durable over periods of hundreds of years
8040027 it is not clear how package integrity during storage can be assured over the extended timescales now being suggested
8040028 if we are going to dispose of the waste this should be done as quickly as reasonably possible
8040029 more banks will come on the troubled list as credit problems worsen
8040030 one would assume we would have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror theyve been helpful they are going to ask us i am sure to replace and rebuild
8040031 i think that assistance is probably going to happen its a matter of how much and how fast
8040032 we need to take a look at the strategic picture now and we need nato the european union to discuss that fact that many assumptions we have made may have changed and we need to take a hard look at this new reality
8040033 we cant let a bully do this because if they do it here theyll do it other places and if we dont stop it here well have to stop it in a much more difficult way
8040034 theyre stirring up a little hate and discontent with that deal
8040035 its like putting up a barrier weve all intermingled for years
8040036 it was freer before but we live in a different world now
8040037 weve gotten more aircraft more vehicles more boats more atvs pretty much everything weve got more and weve got more people to man them
8040038 this may have been mayberry before but its not anymore
8040039 i have one brother hes american he was born on the u s side i was born on the canadian side
8040040 it was like there was no border people back and forth
8040041 im always over here chatting with the girls this is the best pharmacy in the world
8040042 i went to church on the other side i taught sunday school there i live on one of those unguarded streets i used to cross the border all the time
8040043 it hasnt been an easy issue for either side to digest
8040044 but we understand that border patrol and homeland security have a job to do the general public doesnt understand whats crossing that border whether its drugs or illegals
8040045 they understand that theres a change but to them its a way of life
8040046 they never considered themselves in danger theres a sense of security here
8040047 if a kid on the canada side throws a frisbee over here he can come and get it but if he got the frisbee and kept walking down to the arbys to get a soda were going to stop you
8040048 if were wrong once that could be devastating to the whole country
8040049 theres a lot of violence on the southern border so some of thats going to transfer up here
8040050 to protect this area its enormous its huge its wide open youve got to know what youre doing to be an agent up here
8040051 theres a delineated line with mexico here if you were to walk around this town you would probably walk into canada and not even know it
8040052 so they understand were not doing this stuff because of them were doing it to protect them
8040053 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy sound bite

8040056 tells the story of a modern cabaret duo dixie wilson york an aspiring chanteuse who cant catch a break with a gig or a guy and billy daniels her sexy cocktail pianist who knows the songs and loves the ladies at the stroke of midnight on new years eve 1999 the century turns but in the wrong direction the duo is catapulted back in time before the hit songs of the have been created together billy and dixie co opt the songs that make the whole world sing becoming the stars theyve dreamed of being at the turn of the century
8040057 we literally had thousands of songs one hundred years worth of wonderful material at our fingertips but the choices were difficult because ultimately the songs must emerge from the psyche of these two principal characters billy and dixie who are choosing to perform them as their own
8040058 there is an emotional path running through the choice of the songs and at some point we make a subtle shift from the songs that they are stealing and releasing as their own to their own inner music
8040059 all of the songs in the show are classic songs but they are presented in a modern experience that introduces and reintroduces people to this music
8040060 in we introduced people to songs they remember from the 60s in the audience will hear familiar songs in a new way in a new context and with a new angle

8040063 marshall and rick have written a fresh wildly imaginative new musical that will delight surprise and astonish we are thrilled to be its first home
8040064 what excites me most about turn of the century is that it is an original musical its not based on a persons life a movie or a television show its an original idea rick marshall and i have been working on the show for three years its been a wonderful process
8040065 developing a new work getting it ready for its world premiere is always an exciting process and i am loving the opportunity to create another character and put my own stamp on her
8040066 dixie is smart sassy and funny but also shes a girl whos just never been lucky in love or her career she gets the unique chance to make some changes in the way she approaches life by getting sent back in time with jeffs character billy jeff is a very giving actor and that enables me to discover even more and what great songs i get to sing some of the best of the you cant beat it

8040069 how much editorial approval do you need can you not make a single step without it isnt that a crippling mode for an artist to work in do your own ideas and judgments hold so little value do you never feel pretty unless someone tells you so

8040071 blind guides who strain out the gnat and swallow the camel
8040072 you cleanse the outside of cup and dish but inside they are full of plunder and self indulgence
8040073 thats a good question and it should be a simple one
8040074 but right now i feel like theres so many aspects of our great nation which could use a little bit of help or a lotta bit of help that its hard to pick just one
8040075 i think the most important thing is the economy we need to figure out the housing crisis we need to build up our middle class again right now the disparity between the uber rich and the uber poor its worrying and its not getting better we need to focus on a way to just get our economy back to get it back on track

8040105 eso no va conmigo sino que tener una visi n objetiva de las cosas hace algunas semanas escuchamos voces excesivamente alarmistas e incluso pesimistas acerca de las perspectivas de nuestra econom a algunos llegaron a hablar de crisis y dije que hac an un flaco favor a nuestro pa s
8040106 la econom a chilena est resistiendo bien a los problemas que afectan a la econom a mundial seguimos pendiente de la inflaci n pero es evidente que somos m s fuertes que en el pasado y eso es un gran logro nacional estamos capeando satisfactoriamente dir a yo razonablemente el frente de mal tiempo internacional gracias que se ha propiciado un manejo responsable de las finanzas p blicas que nos permite proteger mejor al conjunto de la poblaci n

8040114 its a tool for when local government cant come up with the funds to pay for infrastructure improvements
8040115 many local governments especially in metro atlanta have tapped out their bond capacity
8040116 its like any other development any time you set out to do something of that magnitude youre going to need all those disciplines
8040117 this is another way for public private partnerships to create a funding mechanism for projects that might otherwise sit on the backburner
8040118 local governments can say they dont want this and tell the developers to go away
8040119 if you reduce uric acid at least in some patients you may be able to reduce blood pressure
8040120 this could be one way people develop hypertension and may allow us to develop new therapies
8040121 this is far from being a reasonable therapeutic intervention for high blood pressure but these findings indicate a first step in understanding the pathway of the disease
8040122 you cannot prevent a disease until you know the cause this study is way of finding that out
8040123 the antihypertensive therapies available to patients are well proven and safe
8040124 currently available antihyperuricemic therapies treatments that lower uric acid are not safe enough to be used as first line therapy for most people with high blood pressure

8040186 a sophomoric display of neo urbanite minimalist avant gardism couched in an uncouth attempt to show creatures can rise above mans innate hobbesian inclinations all tied together by a faux commercialistic feel good ikeaism that just screams buy me buy me buy me
8040187 golly i think it will look neat o bordering the front window
8040188 permanently opening the golden door for foreign scientists and engineers
8040189 we will see what legislation the snp come forward with
8040190 i am not intuitively against making sure that people have a choice and an opportunity to cast a vote on these things but i believe it should be a strengthened scotland within the uk
8040191 we had wobbly wendy and now we have twisting tavish tavish scott was previously known for his hardline opposition to a referendum and now we look forward to him upholding liberal democrat principles and supporting the scottish governments referendum bill in 2010
8040192 we congratulate tavish on his election as the lib dem leader he will have a tough job as he takes over the reins of scotlands fourth party especially since scottish politics is now a three horse race
8040193 can i thank the party for this the gold medal of the liberal democrats olympics
8040194 after less than 18 months in government the snp is riding high in the polls theyre popular but heres my prediction by 2010 they will not be
8040195 we can already see the underlying weakness that will undo alex salmond what looks confident sure footed and wise today will be seen as arrogant misguided and politically dishonest tomorrow
8040196 spin is the hallmark of this government but spin has a shelf life
8040197 tavish will address the issues that matter most to the people of scotland not the narrow minded squabbles of the nationalists and labour
8040198 we dont usually have that number of aryan nations people here mr ross said
8040199 it was suspicious to us we turned everything over to the federal authorities
8040200 he adolf said at one point yes it would be on probably the day of his acceptance speech
8040201 it would be from a high vantage point with the named rifle
8040202 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he should be shot
8040203 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8040204 we realise that it takes a cold blooded pragmatic and realist viewpoint to enact the changes which will be necessary to achieve our goals
8040205 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8040206 mr obamas african american heritage is a cause for very violent and hated reactions among some people
8040207 ben make sure you play take my hand precious lord in the meeting tonight play it real pretty
8040208 by the time we got back to the bothy five hours later i was feeling really bad and my hand had swollen up to about three times its normal size
8040209 i didnt think there were any poisonous snakes in the uk let alone scotland
8040210 billy was told if it had gotten any further and reached his heart it could have been fatal
8040211 they kept him in overnight and let it run its course they gave him morphine for the pain and some antihistamines for the swelling
8040212 generally people only get bitten if they do something to scare the snake
8040213 picking one up is a common reason for getting bitten
8040214 they wont attack they are not an aggressive species they will only defend themselves they will run away and they will be more scared of the person than the person is of the snake
8040215 that was my first time grouse beating and will definitely be my last not for 35 a day anyway
8040216 this is exactly what might have been expected from a policy that was not properly costed and which just keeps on rising as more pensioners go on the pay roll and population gets older
8040217 but it is now in place and it should now be honoured because it was a commitment that means that ideas the snp have about reducing class sizes and the like can only be introduced if they have the money to pay for it after honouring free personal care for the elderly
8040218 the scottish government has already committed to providing 40 million in additional funding to local authorities from next year for care services for older people in line with lord sutherlands recommendations
8040219 we are working in partnership with cosla to take forward the recommendations in lord sutherlands report and our wider shared commitment to improve the delivery of care services for older people
8040220 within this overall spend the statistical publication shows that the proportion spent on free personal care has shown a significant rise of 21 per cent
8040221 around half of this rise is directly attributed to one local authority while the general trend confirms the continuing shift in the balance of care allowing more people to continue to live in their own homes
8040222 it is an extremely dangerous activity it can damage the front of your eye and can cause the bursting of blood vessels
8040223 persisting in doing this could lead to permanent damage there is the possibility of blindness
8040224 once you get scarring on the cornea that can be a very serious problem
8040225 there are so many youngsters now doing this that it is only a matter of time before someone loses their sight
8040226 its the kind of daft thing more and more students are tempted to do youre young and youre messing around
8040227 i took it like an eye wash and then just waited to see what happened
8040228 it was very messy most of it ran down my face and ruined my make up
8040229 but it did start to sting almost straightaway and my eye went bright red and bloodshot
8040230 im not sure how much actually went in my eye i had quite a lot to drink already but i think it did tip me over the edge
8040231 my eye was red and sore until the following evening i was a bit worried i had damaged something so i just drank the normal way after that
8040232 it was all a bit silly and a bit of an experiment but it was fun at the time
8040233 we are very concerned about the rise in this practice and about anyone who misuses alcohol in this way
8040234 they would be horrified really and put a stop to it immediately its a dangerous and ridiculous practice and we would have no truck with it
8040235 we strongly condemn all irresponsible uses of alcohol which can lead to very serious health consequences in both the long and short term he said
8040236 the compilation was produced by imus along with kyle lehning randy travis george jones and tracy gershon well known a amp r executive
8040237 imus selected each song and matched it to a specific artist
8040238 the cd will benefit the imus ranch a working cattle ranch run by don and deirdre imus which hosts children who are afflicted with cancer or other serious blood diseases
8040239 mamas dont let your babies grow up to be cowboys
8040240 it has just spread and in some places it is carpeting the cliffs
8040241 it is smothering out the small amount of habitat thats suitable for the slender scotch burnet
8040242 i still dont know how its going to feel swinging
8040243 im being a little tentative to do so im going to give it a couple more days its definitely taken some good steps forward in the past week a lot less pain in the last week
8040244 so id be surprised if every team in contention didnt claim him
8040245 and i dont think they really want to trade him unless they get exactly what theyre looking for
8040246 podr a ocurrir en cualquier parte porque una sola instalaci n est procesando los datos para todos

8040248 we hope to have a deal to mlb by the end of the year
8040249 what a newspaper of the 21st century should look like
8040250 we want this to be true to the game of baseball
8040251 we dont want our bat to suddenly change the parameters of the game we want to fit comfortably in those parameters and i think we will
8040252 i accepted i was not major league caliber at that point
8040253 the result is that it is very strong and as a result of it being strong it is very safe
8040254 it is impossible for this maple bat to shatter in the way the maple bats shatter in the major leagues today you will never have a barrel separating from the handle the worst thing that can happen is a crack there is a never a catastrophic break
8040255 the difference between a catastrophic injury and a bruise is a just little movement
8040256 i liked the handle usually bats like that break easy this felt pretty durable
8040257 all the normal things that happen with bats will happen with this bat
8040258 if you hit a ball on the sweet spot of this bat and the sweet spot of a traditional bat the ball will go equally far
8040259 i cant put a price on the safety of the children
8040260 i dont know the particulars of what it costs if it works well find a way to make it work in montclair
8040261 it sounds like it is supposed to any wood bat is better to me than the ping of the aluminum bat
8040262 you watch the college world series and hear that ping and to me it is not baseball
8040263 that would be the true test let him pitch and try to break that bat
8040264 lo que podemos decir es que estamos absolutamente confiados en que no existe ninguna amenaza cre ble contra la vida del candidato la convenci n dem crata o los habitantes de colorado

8040270 an investment of 41 million in fertilizer research through 1981 returned an incredible 57 billion to u s agriculture
8040271 that doesnt include benefits of the technology to the rest of the world
8040272 tvas fertilizer program is recognized as one of the most effective research and development programs of any u s agency its benefits to the world far outweigh the public investment that the united states made in fertilizer research and development its time to launch a radical initiative to develop a new generation of energy efficient fertilizers to help avert hunger and famine
8040273 i am concerned about the state of the fertilizer industry itself

8040291 this was a surprising and exciting finding our direct observations appear to totally undermine a key rule that has withstood the test of time for over a century we will now make observations with a range of other chemicals and with other techniques to further elucidate the molecular basis for our observations text books will have to be rewritten to revise a rule that has been relied on for over a century advanced techniques such as the one we have developed should give much clearer insight into the action of a wide range of drug molecules which will be of significant interest to drug developers

8040326 i think for the most part our team is pretty solid
8040327 we have a lot of kids returning from last years team i think we have a lot of speed i think we have a lot of skill the question is can we score goals on a consistent basis
8040328 can we continue along and be as successful as weve been
8040329 i think so but it might take a while to find some momentum
8040330 which is 3ft 6in wide 1 065mm i had always assumed that south africa operated standard gauge 4ft 8 in 1 435mm
8040331 the wider gauge standard gauge is the predominant gauge used world wide and will allow the gautrain higher speeds at high levels of comfort and safety it also allows access to modern state of the art technology at the lowest cost

8040333 the traffic condition became less crowded and the air quality also improved

8040336 i was here in february i dont see no blue sky
8040337 first few days when we went out i was coughing a lot after
8040338 the government is taking measures in the right direction but it needs to be scaled up
8040339 they should at least try to continue some of these measures
8040340 they are meaning business in terms of structural changes that will positively influence the climate and the environment
8040341 i fully support the environment friendly measures since the air quality has been improved which puts me in a good mood
8040342 we now have the police recognising the involvement of organised crime and we had specific examples of bikie gangs being involved
8040343 it bounced me off my chair a flash occurred right in front of my face and i never experienced anything like that before
8040344 the brightest flash of lightning that ive ever seen hit that tree and that was followed by the loudest explosion noise
8040345 its huge the tree i mean it split that tree in half and it could have gone any direction
8040346 that was a big tree once im glad it was hit instead of one of our houses
8040347 products such as this from stewart milne offer clear evidence that the mortgage market is starting to get moving again and with other providers dropping their rates in recent weeks theres a definite air of competition
8040348 the products obviously unconventional only being applicable to certain properties but at 4 99 per cent it is definitely worth considering if those properties are suitable
8040349 builders are looking at all ways to attract customers at the moment mortgage rates are actually back to where we were in august 2007 which is a positive sign for builders
8040350 the crux of the problem is the lack of liquidity in the lending market as if you cant get a mortgage it doesnt matter what incentives are being offered
8040351 instead of closing prisons down as they did the government should be opening more jails
8040352 the problem was that the gould report did not say what support structure should be in place for the chief returning officer or describe the role
8040353 this could be a complex and cumbersome management response which deals with the symptoms rather than offering a clear and democratic solution
8040354 i have doubts over whether such a large new quango is needed the proposals are uncosted and likely to lead to an unnecessarily unwieldy reorganisation
8040355 we broadly welcome plans for a national database however we have concerns about womens personal information being kept secure
8040356 we would like some reassurance from the police that their privacy will be respected
8040357 worryingly in many areas front line officers could not easily access information on the databases particularly outside office hours when the majority of domestic abuse incidents occur
8040358 the risk to victims that this situation poses is widespread and largely unmitigated we therefore strongly recommend that a national database in conjunction with national data standards be developed and adopted by all forces as a matter of priority
8040359 we have been to crime scenes and the woman has no idea about the background of her partner
8040360 we have dealt with domestic violence as a local issue and theyre looking now at ensuring our systems are as seamless as possible these people are under the radar its not appropriate in the 21st century that they can move a few miles away and the police are not aware of their background
8040361 we want a consistency of approach that allows that access to information across scotland
8040362 this is not just the offenders but the victims who are also to be on the database this is an intelligence database but it would also inform the risk assessment process
8040363 five members of kings troop royal horse artillery london provided positive samples following their units recent testing as part of the armys drug testing programme internal administrative action has been taken against all five
8040364 drug misuse in the armed forces will not be tolerated
8040365 positive rates in the army over the last three years average 0 8 per cent compared with over 7 per cent in civilian workplace drug testing programmes in the uk
8040366 these are young birds they have only just fledged and they are finding their feet so it might have taken a day or two to get orientated
8040367 how they make their decisions what causes their twists and turns we just dont know i think it would be a shame to know its nice to just marvel at it
8040368 you could say they are on a three year gap year
8040369 bowel cancer is the second biggest cause of cancer deaths in the uk but if picked up early treatment of the disease is more successful
8040370 the scottish government is committed to rolling out fully the uks most comprehensive bowel screening programme across nhs board areas by the end of 2009
8040371 once up and running we will invite approximately 700 000 men and women aged 50 to 74 to take part in screening annually evidence shows this will save around 150 lives every year
8040372 we will continue to work with health boards to publicise this important screening service to help improve uptake rate particularly in disadvantaged areas
8040373 most of that remains undamaged and still ends up in landfill it would never be admitted publicly but it happens all the time
8040374 ordering about 105 per cent is quite normal if stuff gets damaged you dont want your guys waiting to build
8040375 you get to a tipping point where the amount of packaging is so minimised that you get more waste
8040376 so we are never going to get away from all packaging
8040377 i want everything that happened to be laid bare in a public inquiry i think we havent been told the whole story
8040378 the fine is meaningless it could have been millions but wouldnt have brought brian back
8040379 these two deaths were entirely preventable and arose from the clear failure of scottish coal to provide suitable means of communication between different vehicles on site to reduce the risk of collisions as well as a failure to manage vehicles on their site
8040380 there is a clear link here in terms of how these robberies are being carried out
8040381 both incidents have left the victims completely traumatised but this mornings robbery was particularly violent
8040382 we are well aware of the public concerns here and the danger faced by all who are involved in this business
8040383 it is totally unacceptable that they are subject to these types of violent attacks
8040384 we would like to reassure communities that we have a significant number of force resources now deployed including firearms officers and we are working round the clock to trace those responsible
8040385 i would appeal to anyone who has any information on any of these crimes or who thinks they may know who is responsible to contact me we believe there are clearly people out there who know who has committed these robberies and i would encourage them to contact us confidentially if they wish
8040386 what is unusual here is the attempt to do it over a single year it is not extraordinary it is unusual but not extraordinary
8040387 it is public knowledge that there is a significant level of risk about whether savings can be achieved in the current financial year
8040388 aberdeen has got some problems and one or two came out at the same time which led to a lack of public confidence
8040389 but some of the services in aberdeen are among the best in scotland i am quite confident this situation can be turned around
8040390 the ageing of the population is one of the major challenges europe must face with climate change and globalisation
8040391 the eu must make sure public finances are sound and people should work longer we want to carry on with structural reform in particular reform of pensions systems and for healthcare expenditure with the view to ensuring these systems are sustainable in the long term
8040392 there has always been a big debate over how different countries pool their resources the uk has always resisted this strongly but might well be expected to contribute more however i think the uk government would resist this
8040393 economists have been aware of these issues for some time while the uk and scotlands birth rates have been going up there are various reasons why this is not really happening elsewhere
8040394 mediterranean countries have been suffering from chronically low birth rates for years the increasing number of women in the workforce and the falling birth rate has been a factor since the end of the baby boom it could take decades if ever to overturn and even if it were possible the loss of womens earnings would have repercussions for these countries economies
8040395 the government needs to reassure people that they and their investments will be protected
8040396 until recently people thought they were being sensible by investing their money in the stock market or in housing but this has been shown to have huge variability
8040397 the government needs to examine experimental projects overseas such as those in the us for pensioners where a range of facilities are provided on site however they also need to be asking themselves what can be done for pensioners who cant afford this type of housing
8040398 the sport is also a symbolical mental liberation from the restraining yoke of being constantly within reach
8040399 its our nature to create fun happenings probably because our summers are so short
8040400 at first it was difficult to promote them as they were small local events where people did not speak any foreign language
8040401 but now they are raising the interest of foreign press and visitors probably because they are so different from anything else going in their own countries
8040402 when most people build their own home they design the plans and then try and get the cheapest materials possible we had the materials we just needed to design the house
8040403 we managed to get an oak wood flooring big heavy timber joists oak doors and marble steps from whitehill house an old mansion
8040404 from 1922 whitehill was run by an order of nuns so we got stained glass windows which look fantastic
8040405 in 2002 the supermarket was undergoing an extension i spoke to the site manager who said i could take some materials they were going to throw away
8040406 they provided us with steel beams and most importantly large amounts of insulation
8040407 this was absolutely fundamental in making the house what it is you hear a lot about eco houses made of tyres and scrap but the key to any true eco house is having maximum insulation
8040408 we got tens of thousands of pounds of insulation for free materials that were just going to be dumped in landfill sites
8040409 construction and demolition waste accounts for almost half of the waste arising in scotland while over 10 per cent of all materials delivered to building sites become waste without ever being used yet recycled materials are available for many construction uses

8040475 its what you learn after you know it all that counts
8040476 in fact wed like to see it go a little bit further
8040477 we want to make sure that the urgent advice that climate change and water minister penny wong and prime minister kevin rudd have received in terms of what can be done right now to assist water in the coorong and the lower lakes we think that should be part of the inquiry
8040478 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8040479 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8040480 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8040481 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8040482 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8040483 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8040484 weve had five people come forward that formed part of the initial investigation
8040485 and as a consequence to those five people coming forward weve identified another eight people so at this stage were speaking to 13 people
8040486 what we can say at this stage is that there is a number of lines of inquiry that have come from the initial inquiries
8040487 there are a number of inquiries continuing and there are some suspects involved
8040488 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8040489 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8040490 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8040491 we are pleased that we were able to reach this agreement
8040492 following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8040493 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now by doing things the way we did it
8040494 but when you look at the technology we now have and the new ballparks and even some of the old ballparks that have been reconfigured theres no question that it was a challenge to the umpires like anything else in life there are times when you need to make an adjustment
8040495 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities

8040500 its easy to say im not going to support a 3 percent increase but give me some alternatives give me some options what do you want to cut
8040501 you try to hit zero percent obviously thats the goal
8040502 these funds are used to offset unexpected increases in health costs retirement payments and other unforeseen costs to the city
8040503 if we were in high school and this was basic economics thats a failure the teacher would have failed us for a budget like that
8040504 but some of this stuff is just out of control we didnt have the money to start with and now were farther in the hole
8040505 the truck to me was one of the easiest things
8040506 we get all of this money from our old equipment we should buy a new piece of equipment with it
8040507 i hate to raise taxes but on the same token i dont want to cut personnel
8040508 our first priority must be the safety of the public
8040509 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8040510 a thousand years ago it was thought that through heating lead was made non toxic which is clearly not the case these traditions live on and they carry on endangering our health
8040511 its a great tournament to play and a fun city to be in im looking forward to heading there
8040512 in the past 20 years temperature in indonesia rose 0 3 degree celsius that s why we need to anticipate possibilities in the future
8040513 farmers will no longer be able to make a prediction when they will grow rice so that they will suffer losses when the dry season comes earlier than harvest time the dry season which comes one month earlier than usual will lead to harvest failures
8040514 in fact the rice imports account for 20 percent of the total global rice trade
8040515 therefore efforts must constantly be made to ensure food availability through various ways
8040516 right now im getting my visa and as soon as it is ready i will fly to england to sign a contract
8040517 everything has happened very quickly so i couldnt even say goodbye to my team mates
8040518 we believe that the handling of this case raises some significant concerns

8040525 this is the first attempt in europe after nazi germany and the stalinist soviet union to put a neighbouring state on its knees and to change the borders of europe by force

8040546 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8040547 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8040548 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8040549 the ad must not be broadcast again in its current form
8040550 you amp squo ll never know which part of the internet you amp squo ll need
8040551 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
8040552 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
8040553 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
8040554 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
8040555 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
8040556 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
8040557 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful

8040565 ive thought about it but also in the very same moment i think about a person running for president should be representing all age brackets
8040566 i think an important part in this election will be the turnout rate among young voters because if you look at the demographics young voters by overwhelming numbers support obama
8040567 mccain is older and that could appeal to some older people but also there are issues that could drive elderly voters to a democratic position in regard to social security medicare and so on

8040602 there were about 5 000 flight plans in the system but a lot of them were airborne and unaffected
8040603 the only flights that were affected were those that had already pushed off from the gates and couldnt get off the ground it created a backlog

8040612 forrester analysts tj keitt and paul jackson came up with a new phrase to describe video games
8040613 the phrase the industry should rally around is serious games to bring together the numerous disciplines however forrester recommends identifying individual games with the underlying goal of the game for example calling volvo car uks game an immersive learning simulation we dont see this being an issue in a few years as the old guard in the workforce is replaced by younger colleagues as this happens doubts about calling a game a game will subside future business leaders are already thinking in terms of games as seen with ibms bpm video game coming out of a competition between business students at duke university and the university of north carolina at chapel hill

8040635 it would be a shame to see a good property like toorale taken out of production and turned into a national park but if thats what the taxpayers want then so be it
8040636 the government is carefully considering the likely future benefits for the environment and the communities of western nsw
8040637 the cotton growers are offering an opportunity to return large volumes of water to the system
8040638 we have whole towns which rely on these farms for their livelihood
8040639 solid state drives are the best performance options alienware offers hardcore gamers
8040640 these drives offer them shorter load times and faster access rates that put them at a much higher level of performance than traditional hard drives
8040641 the second set was probably the first good set i ve won in four months or so
8040642 i felt like it clicked and the ball started doing what i wanted so thats a good sign
8040643 its just that i havent been able to stay in a tournament long enough i havent been healthy enough tonight was a definite step in the right direction
8040644 this is planetary destabilization and its already begun the question is how do we arrest this before it gets to the point of catastrophe
8040645 the earth could be free of arctic summer ice within our lifetime
8040646 this has not happened as far as we know in 130 000 years as long as human beings have existed on the planet
8040647 if you had a gauge in your car reading in the red zone how long would you feel comfortable driving down the highway like that thats where we are now
8040648 he said you dont understand were going to ban the sale of new automobiles in this country
8040649 if we were to move to the most efficient lighting technologies available today we could reduce electricity demand by 12 percent
8040650 in the new energy economy we see 40 percent of the worlds electricity coming from wind
8040651 that would require building roughly a million and a half wind turbines over the next dozen years now a million and a half may sound like a lot but we make 65 million cars a year
8040652 i mention that just to give a sense of how much renewable energy there is out there three states in the u s kansas north dakota and texas have enough energy capacity to power the whole country
8040653 from being a nation of energy consumers to being a nation of energy producers
8040654 wouldnt it be nice if you put solar panels on your house you got a check in the mail farmers in germany now have a new revenue stream
8040655 we have the solutions we just need to come up with the political will to get those technologies out there even faster
8040656 we believe in using nonviolent civil disobedience at times when its necessary to incite change it takes me to jail sometimes
8040657 as i look around the room i see some of the people ive been to jail with here today
8040658 we cant have half measures we dont have time to lose we have to hit the ground running
8040659 now is the time to speak the truth and bring new people into the political process
8040660 are we going to have the biggest political failure in the history of the world
8040661 maybe i beat him three four five six seven times
8040662 but he beat me 20 30 40 times i got him here and there
8040663 while still depressed on a year over year basis consumers are showing some signs of confidence as the summer closes
8040664 and we arent goliath it takes a lot of investment to compete against google yahoo and microsoft
8040665 no matter how big a check someone like google can write they are a trojan horse
8040666 if an operator shares all its customer information it will allow someone like google to come in and commoditize the most precious assets it has which is all that customer data
8040667 anytime you have a start up youre not sure exactly how its going to go but this community has embraced us and were thrilled
8040668 we thought escanaba would be a great place to have kind of a trendy fun place that people were familiar with
8040669 we have a lady named laurie who comes for her big chill and we have her recipe placed right on our counter
8040670 i actually like the coffee thats why i come here the most its really good and the people are really nice thats why i come here
8040671 we did have an impact from the rising fuel costs because of all the deliveries because were so far north really impacts us
8040672 we have fuel surcharges but we did have to change our prices minimal because we couldnt absorb that cost

8040674 i absolutely love harry connick jr bob wills louis prima im so passionate about that music
8040675 i grew up on christian music which im just as passionate about but the older i get if im in a dressing room or a car some type of jazz or big band is all i listen to
8040676 it was really surprising because you never know how something will be received it was good to know there are people out there who appreciate you trying to go against the flow and do something that may not get played at radio just trying to be creative and different
8040677 sam my oldest child went to bed every night listening to the in the sweet by and by he had just found it on his own and it meant something to him
8040678 and thats all we were able to listen to in the car the
8040679 brown has become one of my best friends in the whole world
8040680 i just cant imagine making any record without brown whether its a mercyme or solo record or whatever its kind of like this spontaneous journey i dont know where were going i dont have a road map lets just go i love that free spirit and i think thats why hes been so successful for so many years hes willing to follow the artist anywhere they want to go and he makes sure that whatever they do is done in style he actually makes me better at what i do
8040681 they got to be a part of the whole creative process and every song was a challenge
8040682 i think they actually loved it because they dont get to play that role they usually play the sheet music and go to the next song there was no sheet music we literally had hymnals
8040683 he loved it and i was sitting there thinking that vinces voice would kill on this song
8040684 so i called thad and said heres the deal do you want to be singing on my record or would you like a song that you wrote to have vince gill singing on it and he said are you kidding me i want vince to sing on the song i wrote so it became this duet vince was so gracious it was awesome its probably my favorite song on the record
8040685 were doing this kind of question and answer thing with the audience and part of it is going to be talking about what we did in our spare time
8040686 its a segue into this thing and the band will back me up on a song on this tour they are very kind to let me do that
8040687 we need to hold on to these as much as we can
8040688 the lyrics certainly dont feel old these songs are something that needs to be passed on to our kids as far as im concerned im already planning on the third hymns record

8040690 saya sangat sangat senang karena bisa berada di sini dan berkompetisi buatku ini sudah merupakan pencapaian yang luar biasa
8040691 setelah beijing saya sempat berpikir tak bisa tampil di sini jadi tanpa banyak persiapan saya rasa saya telah melakukannya dengan cukup baik
8040692 waktu pertama kali masuk lapangan saya sangat senang dan memulai permainan dengan sangat baik tentu saja efek kurang berlatih terlihat kemudian tapi saya sangat senang bisa memiliki kesempatan untuk pelan pelan masuk dan meningkatkan permainan
8040693 sebagai pesaing teratas saya tentu ingin menang tapi untuk saat ini keinginan itu terlalu banyak saya hanya ingin melewati laga demi laga dulu
8040694 saya tak yakin bahwa kami telah menempuh langkah mundur dalam persiapan kami kami memang belum sebaik yang seharusnya namun lawan kami juga bermain bagus kami memiliki lima atau enam peluang
8040695 kami kalah namun kami seharusnya bisa memetik seri atau bahkan menang saya senang kami lolos karena saya sudah banyak menyaksikan pertandingan yang seperti ini yang berakhir sangat ketat
8040696 saya tahu bahwa bermain melawan sebuah tim yang baru saja naik promosi akan sangat sulit
8040697 teniendo en cuenta la libre expresi n de la voluntad de los pueblos oseta y abjaso he firmado los decretos sobre el reconocimiento por la federaci n de rusia de la independencia de osetia del sur y de la independencia de abjasia

8040699 we know from a century of northern resource exploration that there is gas in the beaufort sea oil in the eastern arctic and gold in the yukon there are diamonds in nunavut and the northwest territories and countless other precious resources buried under the sea ice and tundra
8040700 but what weve found so far is merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg
8040701 once solar cell makers reach annual output of 1 000 megawatts that would halve production costs
8040702 it was something that climate change adviser ross garnaut had in his paper proposing that there be matching tax treatment but is absent in the governments green paper
8040703 there is going to be a tax advantage to buying permits rather than spending money on capital expenditure which may be lucrative enough to discourage companies investing in carbon abatement activities
8040704 preferably the tax deductions for buying equipment should match up to what you would have had on expenditure for permits
8040705 if that were to be deductible in one year for permits then maybe that is what expenditure on equipment should also be
8040706 the dissertation itself was on family folklore and its value to future generations

8040711 you watch old nfl films and those guys played at 230 pounds
8040712 now our quarterbacks are 215 and linemen are over 300
8040713 i went to eight clinics in the past year and one of them had 900 people
8040714 thirty years ago you saw maybe one division i player a year
8040715 this spread offense is a lot different and as a quarterback its awesome
8040716 youre 5 yards back before the snap and you can see everything you get the ball and youre already in your progression you dont have to worry about dropping back
8040717 its really fun for everyone the running backs like it because they get their hands on the ball and the wide receivers really enjoy it because they know its a passing offense
8040718 we are way more wide open in the last few years because we like to get basketball players involved
8040719 weve modified and adjusted to different looks but you have to have something to hang your hat on
8040720 were an option team and that hasnt changed in 25 years i think part of what we like about what we do is the uniqueness of it its not something every school does we feel they have to prepare for us probably a little differently than the standard offenses theyre used to seeing
8040721 one week well play six defensive linemen and the next week well play two
8040722 and for the kids who arent in the game its a big problem we cant defend a spread like some teams play without using six d backs and the linemen didnt understand and then the next week a team might run a wishbone and weve got maybe two d backs
8040723 at one point i argued with the decision but i am still about three weeks away
8040724 i have been running routes and i have not had any drawbacks which is good
8040725 on one hand i cant wait for this to be over
8040726 but on the other hand the historic moment that this is what is happening its very important its very empowering
8040727 we feel like weve been managing our business very well and cutting expenses
8040728 its a really tough retail environment out there but we managed to improve our results
8040729 its obviously the one if youre an american you look forward to the most every year theres also a certain energy unlike any other tournament its probably not only a tennis tournament but an event things like today going on outside it is a special place for me
8040730 i think the biggest thing about new york is playing a night session its a different animal than any other tournament i feel comfortable in the fact that ive been in most situations here at this tournament good and bad so id like to think im ready for it
8040731 i think hes playing great i was hitting with him he was playing really well we had a really good practice he was serving huge i guess thats not really a surprise when hes making a lot of first serves a high percentage hes very very tough to break and tough to deal with
8040732 he puts a lot of implied pressure on your serve just by serving that well on these courts quick as they are the ball is flying a little hes going to be dangerous hes got the confidence since hes won here before id look out for him to be dangerous
8040733 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year

8040777 by looking deeper into the layering we are looking farther back in time
8040778 if opportunity were driving with only five wheels like spirit it probably would never get out of victoria crater
8040779 we also know from experience with spirit that if opportunity were to lose the use of a wheel after it is out on the level ground mobility should not be a problem

8040785 the greater the carbon stores the greater the impact it causes
8040786 warming will increase the decomposition rate of the soil organic matter and more carbon dioxide will be generated

8040814 i know the pain war causes i understand the frustration caused by our mistakes in this war and i regret sincerely the additional sacrifices imposed on the brave americans who defend us but i also know the toll a lost war takes on an army and on our countrys security by giving general petraeus and the men and women he has the honor to command the time and support necessary to succeed in iraq we have before us a hard road but it is the right road it is necessary and just those who disregard the unmistakable progress we have made in the last year and the terrible consequences that would ensue were we to abandon our responsibilities in iraq have chosen another road it may appear to be the easier course of action but it is a much more reckless one and it does them no credit even if it gives them an advantage in the next election

8040817 the dollar continues to be boosted by increased expectations of weaker economic growth in other major developed economies
8040818 recent economic data points towards a weakening of real gdp growth in the eurozone economy and a more accommodative monetary policy could be needed to prevent the region from falling into a recession
8040819 on the other hand the next step by the federal reserve policy makers will be to raise interest rates according to minutes of the federal open market committee meeting released on tuesday moreover the recent selloff in commodities particularly in oil should alleviate some downward pressure in the us economy

8040824 cancelling these subsidies might reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 6 percent a year while contributing 0 1 percent to global gdp
8040825 governments should urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones
8040826 many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
8040827 some countries spend more on subsidies than on health and education combined they stand in the way of more environmentally friendly technologies
8040828 some countries spend more on subsidizing oil than they do on health and education combined
8040829 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
8040830 urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones
8040831 its clearly an area that we need to re examine in our fight against climate change
8040832 the world knows that the eastern amazon continues to experience problems with deforestation and fragmentation but the western amazon still has large tracts of intact rainforest
8040833 we are worried that these projects could disturb and open up some of the most remote and intact places
8040834 we know people are going to drive we want them in their cars for less time
8040835 i believe in local control i come from a city council
8040836 but traffic congestion doesnt all of a sudden go from bad to good when you cross any particular city or county border and air quality and climate challenges dont respect artificial boundaries
8040837 most people dont want to live in dense urban cores most people want a little elbow room they want a yard for their children to play in
8040838 they want a little grass a little garden a little breathing room they can call their own and who the hell are you to tell people they cant
8040839 its either going to be some regulation restricting your behavior or some huge tax and neither of those is politically popular
8040840 so theres been a big debate about whether we can do this all with carrots
8040841 ive spent most of my 30 year career fighting regional planning and regional government
8040842 but what you are seeing here is a pretty thoughtful approach there are incentives for in fill development and building along transportation corridors and in the end it doesnt prevent development in suburban areas it just says there are standards and it has to be done well

8040846 an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year old drinking age
8040847 in general alcohol education asserts abstinence in order to be compliant with the law
8040848 this has not produced constructive behavioral change among young people in fact it may contribute to dangerous binge drinking behaviors
8040849 i was a faculty member at the university of pennsylvania when a young woman due to overdrinking fell out a dorm window
8040850 its time to have a conversation about what abuses are what responsibility is and to try to bring some rationality to drinking and not make it like an adventure
8040851 all of us have been bombarded by the same e mail message which is an orchestrated move on the part of madd to complain about the stance were trying to take about the present law
8040852 i moved it all to delete most of us simply believe that the fact that one cannot drink before 21 simply encourages clandestine behavior
8040853 you can volunteer to go to war at 18 but you cant get a fucking beer until youre 21 its absurd
8040854 as a freshman you can get a drink if you want one
8040855 the satisfaction is in acquiring the alcohol you feel badass
8040856 when i studied abroad americans were laughed at for blackout drinking
8040857 college presidents arent out to have a more inebriated college population
8040858 i think it would be better to create social pressure rather than legal pressure to be responsible
8040859 during that time there was an increase in the problem of drinking at high school level
8040860 one of the other things we know from studies is the younger they are when they start to drink the more likely they are to develop alcohol problems in later life
8040861 ive seen no evidence that lowering the drinking age is going to result in less drinking its like the idea of getting rid of speeding by eliminating speed limits
8040862 i dont see the logic in saying that because alcohol is there among school age children we should make it easier
8040863 i think the trend is growing more and more to holding colleges liable for injuries that happen related to alcohol
8040864 fraternities are a big target most are gross negligence suits
8040865 its definitely something they pay attention to and are concerned about
8040866 that wasnt the first or second thing that crossed my mind
8040867 we enforce the law and put it in our student handbook we try to have as much oversight as we can while the students are on campus so i wasnt really worried about that liability
8040868 we are very much in favor of a discussion of binge drinking and are well aware of the problem
8040869 its not really clear lowering the drinking age will address the issue the presidents preference is to look at alternative solutions

8040874 we believe mohammed was trying to get away from the situation when he fell and hit his head on the pavement sustaining serious injuries
8040875 we are now trying to establish how he came to fall and hit his head in this way was he assaulted punched or pushed
8040876 this is a murder inquiry and we are seeking to establish to what extent race played a part in what happened
8040877 a police patrol car did stop at the kebab shop earlier in the evening and officers spoke to the owner but no crimes were being committed at that time
8040878 there were officers on the scene almost immediately after the trouble started as this is a highly patrolled area
8040879 i asked them to leave then noticed a police car pull up outside so i went over and spoke to the officers i asked them to keep an eye on the boys and they said they would then left
8040880 mohammed was a young student who was loved by his family friends and teachers he was a charming loving boy and there is nothing that can replace our loss all of those involved in committing this crime should be punished for this crime on a young innocent 16 year old boy

8040887 suppose for example youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver for whom would you vote
8040888 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8040889 with people who have a lot of gifts its hard for people to identify with them
8040890 barack obama is handsome hes incredibly bright hes incredibly well spoken and hes incredibly successful not exactly the easiest guy in the world to identify with
8040891 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy soundbite
8040892 weve got to start smacking back in short understandable bites
8040893 everybody is nervous as all get out everybody says we ought to be ahead by 10 15 points what the heck is going on
8040894 its clearly an area that we need to re examine in our fight against climate change
8040895 some countries spend more on subsidizing oil than they do on health and education combined
8040896 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
8040897 urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones
8040898 one of the most powerful expertly crafted and undeniably important films ive seen this year
8040899 would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
8040900 looking at the amount of additional oil production its a drop in the bucket
8040901 a lot of people dont realize that it would take time to develop this resource
8040902 the key issue here is timing its not that opening the outer continental shelf wont make an impact its just that it wont make an impact tomorrow
8040903 i think some people have the idea that if the outer continental shelf opened up tomorrow there will be an oil company drilling the day after tomorrow
8040904 it just doesnt happen that way it takes time to do all of this
8040905 one thing theyre telling us is that they want something done about it if we ask should the government do this the instinct is to say yes they may be skeptical about it making a difference but they want something done
8040906 but it is a significant shift in the publics mood
8040907 i dont think the public came up with the idea of offshore drilling as a solution
8040908 the publics looking for political leaders to provide answers and this is one thats certainly been the focus of a lot of discussion particularly coming from the white house and the mccain campaign
8040909 the overwhelming majority though says no it should not be allowed whether drilling is going to be a realistic problem or not the perceived problem could drastically impact tourism people would think okay theres oil drilling and were not really comfortable with that
8040910 what a lot of people dont take into account is the support facilities moving the product from the well to the offshore refinery
8040911 there are tankers and supply boats moving back and forth theres a lot more traffic and a lot of energy being expended
8040912 and if it was to die its not going to come back its not something we can replant and grow
8040913 im not sure how its going to impact the tourism industry
8040914 its an interesting balance because obviously you have to have a pristine clean environment thats very very important to the picture of the coastal areas such as the keys on the other hand people need to be able to have affordably priced fuels to get to these destinations and they have to have more disposable income
8040915 some who are saying yes we do believe oil drilling would help that 5 a gallon gas is very scary
8040916 all those businesses in huntington beach lost tens of millions of dollars
8040917 it was a big wake up call think about that on a statewide level
8040918 when they feel this kind of financial pinch people really will gravitate toward any kind of answers floated out there especially ones that appear to be quick fixes

8040920 a large number of the bat carcasses we found had no visible injuries it didnt look like anything had happened to them
8040921 they were lying on the ground no broken wings or injuries you would expect to see if they were struck by these large blades
8040922 we started looking inside and what we found was a large proportion of these bats internally had severe hemorrhaging so they were full of blood
8040923 what happens when you fly through an area when the pressure drops dramatically is the lungs overexpand and it causes breakages in all the small vessels around the lungs

8040958 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8040959 i could have voted from my home she is our captain and we dont want to see her disrespected
8040960 it may mean more public spending but it doesnt necessarily mean a windfall tax there are other ways of being able to provide the money for this energy action
8040961 the only stick they energy firms will understand is a windfall tax i have no problem with companies making profits these are excessive profits these are immoral profits it isnt good enough and we have got to take action now
8040962 a legalised raid on the companys bank accounts that would be very unhelpful because it would scare off investors and also could make the cost of investment much higher and in the end that would end up on the customers bills every 1m you take out of each company through this legalised raid is 1m they have to raise elsewhere
8040963 the monthly numbers of approvals for house purchase which have fallen by some two thirds over the last year levelled off in july it would however be premature to think that the housing market will now start to recover because overall approval activity continues to be very low
8040964 mortgage activity appears to be stabilising although the paltry level of activity is not supportive of a near term pick up in house prices
8040965 few crumbs of comfort can be taken from recent signs that mortgage activity may have finally found a floor amid a backdrop of a stalling economy and expected rises in unemployment
8040966 the shortage of mortgage funding has limited activity across the mortgage market including the buy to let sector which has a significant number of lenders that rely on wholesale funding
8040967 these figures show the extent of uncertainty in the housing market which alistair darling made worse by sending out confused signals over a stamp duty holiday
8040968 many people are putting their lives on hold as a result of labours economic incompetence the chancellor should adopt the conservatives plan to abolish stamp duty for nine out of 10 first time buyers
8040969 the pressures on household budgets are reflected in the relatively weak rise in individuals deposits and with consumer borrowing growing only slowly it seems that consumers are acting prudently
8040970 the planning and running of elections need to be robust and coordinated we are still trying to run 21st century elections with 19th century structures and the system is under severe strain
8040971 all aspects of our operations performed well during the first quarter
8040972 with continuing healthy demand for our products our strong order backlog improved operational performance and growing international opportunities we feel kewaunee is on track for a good year our on going improvement continues to be challenged however by higher prices for certain raw materials and by higher energy and transportation costs to date we have been successful in moderating the impact of these increases on our bottom line as we have implemented strategies to increase sales volumes increase sales prices when possible and reduce energy consumption and costs we will continue to diligently pursue these and other strategies as we progress through this challenging year
8040973 some of the perverse judgments in our courts that seem to bend over backwards to accommodate terror suspects
8040974 we are dealing with people who are prepared to do anything kill any number and use suicide attacks to further their aims they are driven by an extreme perversion of islam which holds that mass murder and terror are not only acceptable but necessary to those who reject democracy to those who preach hate to those who encourage violence you are not part of the mainstream you are not welcome as part of our society
8040975 promoting community cohesion should be part of our response to terrorism
8040976 the introduction of sharia law for muslims is actually the logical endpoint
8040977 weaken destabilize and demoralise those muslims who embrace liberal values and desperately want to integrate fully in british society
8040978 i found myself thinking that it is mainstream britain which needs to integrate more with the british asian way of life not the other way around

8040996 what i hate the most is the attitude that when you have a bad game the only resource is to buy
8040997 the solution is to play as a team to respond as a team and show we have the needed quality it hurt terribly to lose a game like saturday but you cannot be too catastrophic it is not necessary to make a revolution
8040998 i do not know why we are always under pressure to buy 30m or 40m players
8040999 i am under pressure to buy good players it is as simple as that good players are not always necessarily linked to the price there is still a market to buy the right players we are struggling to find them but we will find them dont worry
8041000 we have no complex with the names of signings the names dont impress me if you want to compare us with chelsea they buy robinho what can you do about it frankly we can sign an expensive player but i feel we have not to look at chelsea or man united or liverpool we have to look at ourselves if we can find one more we will do it if not it will not limit our ambitions
8041001 i believe that to bring him back and lose him again for three weeks would be a mistake but if i think there is not a medical risk i will play him
8041002 hangeland got in front of him but it was not only gallas it was more a team effort that was not right on the corner for fulhams goal
8041003 it was a ball that if you defend well at the near post it should cleared it would be unfair to single anybody out on saturday we lost as a team and we want to respond as a team
8041004 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8041005 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8041006 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8041007 the ad must not be broadcast again in its current form
8041008 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8041009 i dont want to say there is some magical solution here
8041010 i think if you look at any sport strength up the middle is the most important thing i know thats an often used clich but hockey is no different ive found that when you have five centermen playing youre so much more valuable because its so much easier for a centerman to play wing than for a wing to play center its a natural easier thing
8041011 we had five centermen and we moved one to play left wing and he could always take face offs if someone got kicked out and that goes back to the importance of face offs
8041012 if you look at our hershey calder cup title run in 2006 our centermen were the best big and strong we had joey tenute who had 50 points as our fourth line centerman we had stecks and gordon on the same line we had five centermen again
8041013 and if you look at our team now you go from nick backstrom to fedorov to nylander to steckel to gordon to laich to keith aucoin as no 7 and viktor kozlov can play there too and kyle wilson has scored 30 goals the last two years in the american league and hes still a young guy learning
8041014 and its so great when brooks can play all three positions as im sure sergei can play all three positions if you needed him well sergei can play four positions i dont know if we want to try him in goal but he can play them all that gives you such an added boost because everything ive heard this year is that everybody is looking for a centerman keith aucoin over 80 games keith is probably right there with jason krog as the mvp of the ameican hockey league when we played against albany in the playoffs two years ago i went up to him afterwards and shook his hand and said i never realized how good a player you are hes just a highly competitive small guy from division iii that has had to work for everything hes gotten thats great depth
8041015 but the biggest responsibility is how they play in their own zone because theyve got the added responsibility of playing down low for the most part they have to be responsible defensively that goes for nick or keith aucoin or anybody in between
8041016 you have to know what youre doing without the puck and thats the hardest thing to learn as a centerman people change systems as they change teams and they have to change too they have to be adaptable that why as a former centerman i always think theyre the smartest guys on the ice
8041017 generally speaking centers are more reliable in their own zone the more people you can put on the ice that are reliable defensively it can only help your hockey club
8041018 its nice for a coach because if a centerman goes down with an injury you can slide somebody right in there and not miss a beat i think from a coaching standpoint they enjoy having that many centers
8041019 people say you have a top six group of forwards and then you have a bottom six
8041020 we think the game should be played with a top nine with the nine being a transition line almost where they can all score and defend where you can play any line against any other line alexander semin against any other line well sit there and say hey listen well take our chances that theyll outscore you but when we dont have the puck well still be able to defend and then you have maybe nylander clark and fleischmann or fehr on another line then youve got your first line your fourth line might have eric fehr on it who is capable of scoring more than 10 goals i think watching him play or it might have chris clark on it
8041021 no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
8041022 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8041023 confusion about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression

8041038 to be truly effective a global response is needed but the uk has an opportunity to lead the way
8041039 in the uk alone biofuel subsidies cost 550m annually in 2005 a similar investment in preventing deforestation and peatland destruction could have offset the equivalent of up to 37 of all uk co2 emissions
8041040 in the uk we can dramatically increase funding for forest and peatland projects domestically and with key partners especially in south east asia as well as lobbying at an international level for the right global policies
8041041 all this can be done within our current budget by ending wasteful and damaging biofuel subsidies
8041042 while ministers are calling for the international community to look at the impact of biofuels here in the uk the governments policy means people are filling up their cars with biofuels that may be damaging the environment and endangering food security
8041043 time and again the government has been warned that their policy of targets without safeguards is madness

8041048 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem

8041050 this is the first time a long term decline in energy storage in minke whales has been demonstrated
8041051 explosive harpoons and a large calibre rifle in the event that death was not instantaneous
8041052 lots of dead bodies will provide robust data so if you kill lots of whales then you will be able to get some information the question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed scientific whaling is not about science and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it to be done

8041107 further examples in which lack of defragmentation in some linux filesystems such as ext3 is a serious issue includes server applications where rapid concurrent and random file creation update or access occurs such systems include large scale carrier grade voice mail systems media messaging service centers mmscs and sms smscs short message service centers servers media servers such as large scale voice mail and ums servers are required to stream hundreds of voice or video streams concurrently to hundreds of users in near real time conditions these types of applications are particularly susceptible to file fragmentation access delays during playback of a voice e g voice mail or video file due to multiple fragmentation in the media file can lead to playback interruption or distortion as fragmentation increases over time service capacity of these systems degrades because of increased cpu and i o overhead resulting from fragmentation induced disk thrashing
8041108 being able to use more than 4gb of ram on a 32 bit pc requires support for pae in the os kernel microsoft has only supported this extra ram in its enterprise datacenter and 64 bit versions of windows the standard 32 bit versions of windows xp vista and windows server are all still constrained to using 4gb of physical ram
8041109 currently mac os x leopard hosts both 32 bit and 64 bit apps on top of a 32 bit kernel using pae the 32 bit kernel can address 32gb of ram in the mac pro and xserve apples consumer machines only support 4gb ram
8041110 this is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive it indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem
8041111 while searching for bat carcasses under wind turbines we noticed that many of the carcasses had no external injuries or no visible cause of death
8041112 if bats are killed in canada that could have consequences for ecosystems as far away as mexico
8041113 i really tried to emphasise here that this process up to copenhagen is a golden opporutnity for african countries to make sure that the next regime does meet their needs in a much better way
8041114 they need to formulate what is essential to them to act both to limit emissions and to adapt to the impacts of climate change
8041115 africa has to know whats to the liking of africa
8041116 africa is still not profiting from the instruments we have
8041117 countries have developed a better understanding here of how they want to deal with deforestation how they want to reward people for forest conservation
8041118 i think theres a strong sentiment in the room especially among developing countries that a decision to address a sector is something you decide at the national level

8041131 the credit crunch means that consumers are now looking for the best purchase price possible and dealers want more business opportunities we provide both but we need to ensure buyers and sellers are aware of our offering
8041132 this is where context will help their experience in promoting other online businesses is invaluable and we look forward to seeing the benefits they can bring for us

8041134 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8041135 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8041136 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8041137 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8041138 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8041139 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8041140 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8041141 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8041142 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8041143 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8041144 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8041145 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8041146 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8041147 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8041148 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8041149 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8041150 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8041151 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8041152 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8041153 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8041154 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great

8041170 shame on you barack obama enough with the speeches and the big rallies and then using tactics that are right out of karl roves playbook
8041171 senator obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail but he didnt start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president so when he had a chance to act on his speech he chose silence instead
8041172 last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take
8041173 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8041174 well you know senator obama it is very difficult having a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote and that has been a pattern
8041175 if we dont have universal health care we will be betraying the democratic partys principles sen obamas plan does not and cannot cover all americans
8041176 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002

8041188 we think everybody should have some money in international markets
8041189 we think any equity investor should have some exposure there
8041190 if you add an international investment in with a u s investment it tends to help smooth it out a little bit
8041191 you could look at some sector funds on an international basis
8041192 a sector meaning buying technology or healthcare but on an international basis you could also buy just a country fund say you just want to buy finland you can buy finland if you want to buy spain you could buy spain
8041193 it was difficult to locate the source of the fire

8041204 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8041205 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8041206 explains why he wants to give another 4 billion tax break to oil companies
8041207 we will go the extra mile to be on time
8041208 this is a classic boom bust cycle and its not at all good for the industry
8041209 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8041210 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8041211 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there but i could only do this if i could commit 100 percent physically mentally emotionally and i cant do that ive tried to convince myself and my body to give it one more year but in the end i just dont think i could turn it on like i need to again
8041212 neem je verlies binnen 10 jaar zal je blij zijn dat je je verlies van 60 genomen hebt en er aandeel x mee kocht dat later misschien evenveel of nog sterker daalt

8041216 these systems are viewed as cost effective but they have the drawback of the initial distribution of allowances that are difficult to determine the process of creating new methodologies and applying an approved methodology to a proposed project is expensive and time consuming
8041217 the entrenched powers of the bush cheney years have everything to gain from keeping things just the way they are they will pull out all the stops to elect john mccain because they know hell keep looking out for them
8041218 but i have news for them their days are numbered
8041219 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8041220 i have a better idea lets give them four more months and then elect barack obama
8041221 west virginians value hard work patriotism and faith in god they mine the coal make the steel and work the assembly lines that make our industries tick their experience and knowledge has earned each of them a ph d in life they can shake your hand look you in the eye and touch your heart
8041222 and let me tell you something they cant afford four more years like the last eight they need and deserve better from washington
8041223 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8041224 mccain has voted against tax credits for renewable energy 11 times and his only idea to solve our energy crisis is to keep doing what were doing as we watch prices go up and up and up
8041225 our demonstration of the environmental sensitivity of alpine lake ecosystems highlights both their vulnerability and usefulness as indicators of the effects of global warming and the predicted increases in climatic variability
8041226 the climate regime in the 2000s altered the character and the function of high elevation aquatic ecosystem
8041227 forecasts of increased temperature and climatic variability in the future pose serious ramifications for both the biodiversity and ecosystem function of high elevation lakes
8041228 the research is clear if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on misguided biofuel subsidies 15bn this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change
8041229 in addition to this the protection of these habitats yields a plethora of valuable eco system services particularly in the poorest countries
8041230 this approach would be dramatically cheaper than any other means of achieving the same result to be truly effective a global response is needed but the uk has an opportunity to lead the way
8041231 in the uk we can dramatically increase funding for forest and peatland projects domestically and with key partners especially in south east asia as well as lobbying at an international level for the right global policies
8041232 forest and peatland conservation is one of the few methods at our disposal where we can do this now and at low cost
8041233 this report is timely and welcome it is becoming increasingly clear that unless we find a practical solution to the problems caused by deforestation the battle against climate change is in danger of being lost
8041234 the hypocrisy of the government is staggering while ministers are calling for the international community to look at the impact of biofuels here in the uk the governments policy means people are filling up their cars with biofuels that may be damaging the environment and endangering food security
8041235 im sure there will be a change of policy this autumn
8041236 what the detail is of that change will determine the level of my enthusiasm for remaining
8041237 they are simply going to make much more money for doing absolutely nothing

8041248 its a highly densely brushed area that runs along a small tributary of the don river and police were called and its at this point we found him to be shot and didnt identify him till some time later
8041249 we have no sense of what evan was doing there and hes not from that area and were looking for anybody who knows him
8041250 its not a trail thats walked on its a really small trail its literally a mountain bike trail and not used extensively and for the city of toronto its a rural area and densely brushed lots of trees lots of shrubs its not a parkland
8041251 i couldnt imagine why she was so excited i thought cant everyone do this
8041252 he gave lots of lessons and was always asking me to sit for him
8041253 i was a very grumpy 13 year old and i had all of these posters of movie stars on my walls on saturdays my best friend and i would go up on her roof and cut out pictures of our favorite stars from movie magazines and paste them into our scrapbooks we especially loved nelson eddy wed hold his photos up and tell him we were going to show him an australian sunset
8041254 i dont know how it came to me to try watercolor but when i did it was so much faster and easier than making all those little strokes from then on pen and ink were out
8041255 i love painting eyes they really are the windows to the soul
8041256 if i see a photograph of a face and it has good contrast ill do a painting its especially good if the person isnt showing any teeth i hate to paint teeth
8041257 in those days the stars were always being asked for autographs so it wasnt such a big deal
8041258 every time id paint a celebrity id send a duplicate of the painting so he or she could keep it making a copy was much quicker than painting the original
8041259 id like to kiss ya but i just washed my hair
8041260 her assistant was also named marie and she would call occasionally to chat she told me that alice received many paintings and drawings of herself but marees are the best i shouldnt say so but i liked hearing that
8041261 ive always been interested in indian history particularly the partitioning of india and pakistan
8041262 not sweepstakes anyone can send in his or her name address and phone number i liked the contests that required some skill
8041263 i won several trips to israel hawaii disneyland and so many tvs and transistor radios i cant even count
8041264 cal and i were always going out to dinner or to the symphony or someplace with my contest prizes
8041265 the mayor came up to me afterwards and said you ought to be in politics kid
8041266 here was this woman with these enormous well she had quite a figure
8041267 i didnt want him to be too disappointed when he got home
8041268 i could have used those a while back when i had a mastectomy but its been 4 1 2 years now and im still cancer free so im very thankful for that
8041269 love is the net where hearts are caught like fish
8041270 i wrote to him asking if he would sign a portrait of him that i had done
8041271 he wrote back saying he would have to see it first i wrote back to him saying if i were in your position id do the same and enclosed the painting with a self addressed stamped envelope sure enough he autographed it and sent it back
8041272 i wrote to sen obama asking for a picture he sent back a lovely photograph of his wife and him along with his autograph
8041273 this will be the first time ive actually been able to vote
8041274 im always writing to my representatives giving them my two cents they need to hear our voices
8041275 its become hard to send the paintings to the stars i dont blame them they never know whats inside an envelope if i send something out im afraid i wont get it back but im going to keep doing the portraits as long as i can if there ever came a time when i couldnt paint well life just wouldnt be worth living anymore
8041276 otherwise were all going to win these elections hold these offices go around with our titles for the rest of our lives
8041277 but the reason we do all this is so we can change the lives of ordinary people and save the planet for our children and grandchildren
8041278 that will only happen if we dramatically and i do mean dramatically increase the capacity of democracy to deliver
8041279 for giving me one more excuse to show up at my partys convention
8041280 the whole idea was wed all go around telling everybody that this democracy is messy and the worst of all systems in churchills words except for all the others
8041281 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think he can deliver on anything you believe candidate y can deliver for whom will you vote
8041282 americas going to get back on track on climate change we will partner with the rest of the world after this election
8041283 chinas stellar growth in renewable can also be attributed to the speed at which it has built up its supply chain capability to the point where it is likely to have nine gigawatts of manufacturing capacity in a few years
8041284 china is also likely to become a significant exporter of wind turbine equipment in a few years adding to its already strong presence in the solar industry
8041285 warming in the himalayan region has been much greater than global average both increasing and decreasing rainfall patters have been detected in the area weather patterns are becoming more unpredictable and extreme dry seasons become dryer and wet seasons wetter this phenomenon is causing concern over the long term reduction in total water supply affecting lives and livelihoods of the himalayan people especially in agriculture practices and long term food security
8041286 there is an urgent need to increase scientific co operation and regional collaboration to reduce this information gap
8041287 the hindu kush himalayan region is the highest most complex mountain region in the world it extends more than 3500km over eight countries from afghanistan in the north west to myanmar in the south east the region ranges from the plateau regions of tibet and other mountain areas of china to the ganges basin in india and has the upland watersheds of the ten major asian river systems
8041288 as for the accce coalition it was founded this year solely to address the advancing legislation aimed at cutting the emissions of fossil fuels like coal that are blamed for global warming
8041289 over the next 100 years the shape of our coastline will change and our favourite sea side destinations may not look the way they were captured in our holiday snapshots
8041290 to try and predict what these places will look like in the future we have examined how sea level rise and increased storms will affect all our coastal sites we know where change is most likely to happen and what this change might be
8041291 we need to realise that our environment is not fixed and that change is inevitable society needs to learn to adapt
8041292 weve been talking with staff were all struggling to some extent with the problem of white workers who will not vote for obama because of his color it is a very powerful thing to get over

8041311 there are a lot of activities going on at the jcc
8041312 if you believe that obama is going to get us out of iraq think again the people i talk to the people who know the foreign policy entourage around obama particularly anthony lake samantha power these are the conventional wilsonian liberal interventionists who more or less favored invading iraq to begin with or at least they kept their mouths shut or they might have preferred to do it with more un cooperation more european help and so on and so forth
8041313 the charge is ridiculous i opposed the war in iraq and spoke out in radio and television i consistently and loudly favored withdrawal i have spoken out about the need to incorporate the welfare of iraqis into withdrawl plans since rick is a person who has spoken out forcefully against the falsehoods of the bush administration it is disappointing that he himself proves so indifferent to facts

8041327 let me be clear weve conducted an intensive investigation chased down numerous leads and carefully reviewed the evidence to date
8041328 it is a very serious federal crime to threaten a presidential candidate in this case however there is insufficient evidence at this time to indicate a true threat plot or conspiracy against senator obama
8041329 reported threats hateful and bigoted though they were involved a group of meth heads methamphetamine abusers all of whom were impaired at the time and they cannot independently corroborated
8041330 the evidence involving alleged threats does not warrant federal charges but the investigation is ongoing and we are keeping an open mind

8041347 after 20 minutes the pilot called nyala airport to tell him the plane had been hijacked and that he is en route to tripoli in libya
8041348 civil aviation agreed to allow the plane to land in kufra for humanitarian reasons after the pilot signalled that the plane was short of fuel
8041349 the passengers are inside the plane so far i dont know the exact number of hijackers dialogue is underway between the hijackers and the libyan authorities
8041350 i am worried about my father and mother they are coming from nyala on this flight no one has any information
8041351 this is the result of what the government is doing in the camps of displaced people in nyala
8041352 im not sure if its connected to kalma but its related to that the government kills and the international community does not intervene what can the darfurian people do
8041353 the pilot of the airliner did not contact egypts air traffic towers and did not request to enter egypts airspace to land in any egyptian airport

8041355 when hillary clinton speaks she will be an articulate voice for the working men and women the middle class families that have been squeezed and she will make the case as she uniquely can for why barack obama is the right choice for the presidency

8041363 if you buy a 2 tomato transplant you can probably get about 10 worth of tomatoes off of that one plant so even though across the country and depending on the plant its going to vary you can save probably hundreds of dollars by growing your own food

8041369 something were trying to do in our little way is fill that funding gap thats still out there between the very early stage family and friends round and venture capital
8041370 we do think calcef clean energy angel fund has an important position both as a way to bridge this funding gap but also as credibility in the energy space that allows other less familiar investors to get more comfortable
8041371 if you look at who backs internet and telecom and semiconductor and life science companies its entrepreneurs who made a lot of money in that space in the past
8041372 right now there are lots of vcs that are followers
8041373 they want others to prove theres a technology there and put the first money there and prove that it works then youll have 50 people who want to put money in

8041377 the big picture is that global warming is putting hurricanes on steroids
8041378 as so many grapple with tropical storm fays landfall in the united states our thoughts and prayers are with those in harms way
8041379 although no single weather event can be attributed to global warming its critical to understand that a warming climate is supplying the very conditions that fuel the strongest storms
8041380 increasing vulnerability to hurricanes global warmings wake up call for the u s gulf and atlantic coasts
8041381 we must account for increasing storm activity and rising sea level when managing our coasts especially by restoring and protecting coastal wetlands lowlands and barrier islands that provide crucial natural levees

8041391 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels
8041392 this means the benefits of the diet a diet that is lifesaving in many children and therapeutic in most of them continue to outweigh the risks
8041393 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8041394 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8041395 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8041396 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8041397 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8041398 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8041399 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8041400 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8041401 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself
8041402 we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight and we believe that these principles may also apply to other sensory loss such as deafness or loss of function following brain injury

8041415 clearly i want to win all the time but ive learned that sometimes its more advantageous to score as many points as possible and live to fight another day
8041416 my aim is still to win the world championship and you dont do that by ending up in the barriers after making an opportunistic move
8041417 in valencia we scored a very useful haul of points and ive actually come away from the weekend having extended my lead in the championship despite losing two points to felipe massa
8041418 im mentally strong enough to be able to deal with that and im more relaxed about it too im playing a long game
8041419 i think the organisers did a great job getting it ready and i can really see valencia growing into a great track it certainly wasnt your average street circuit it was very flat wide and fast so almost the complete opposite of monaco
8041420 the most difficult thing about the track was its dustiness it was very slippery so if you locked your brakes you could find yourself sliding quite a bit as i found out on a couple of occasions

8041430 falling profitability and flagging confidence have spread from the consumer sector to britains business and professional services firms a survey of the services industry shows
8041431 profitability in the service sector is clearly under pressure this pressure initially confined mainly to consumer services such as hospitality and travel has spread to the professional and business services sector this reflects much tougher trading conditions for business and professional firms after a period when business trends had been holding up in the face of the slowing economy
8041432 population adjusted australia and new zealand are two of the best sporting nations in the world
8041433 as we preen ourselves over our olympic achievements its worth pausing to consider britains amazing haul of gold medals in the light of the broader economic context relative to our nations population and wealth how have we done in comparison to others based on population alone team great britain representing a country with a population of 60 million did rather well compared with the usual olympic suspects outranking china the us and russia the uk also outperformed by some considerable distance the other members of the g7 however were nowhere near the top 10 sporting nations on this basis despite all the smug comments about our medal superiority vis vis australia a population adjusted score shows not surprisingly that people down under are streets ahead of us in sporting prowess population adjusted australia and new zealand are two of the best sporting nations in the world

8041438 pressure is mounting on gordon brown to find help for hard pressed families as the new deputy governor of the bank of england warned that the financial situation was at least as bad as that of the 1970s
8041439 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
8041440 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
8041441 i hope the bank of england are doing more than cross their collective fingers

8041479 el equipo est preparado para lo que viene es un torneo bastante corto que por eso debemos sumar apartir de esta jornada contra atlas est claro que no podemos esperarnos al final del torneo para sacar los puntos necesarios y calificar si no todo lo contario queremos asegurar nuestra calificaci n lo antes posible y esa es la mentalidad de todo el platel dijo el guardameta americanista antes de partir a guadalajara
8041480 el grupo est muy apretado creo que la diferencia de puntos que existe con los dem s equipos nos obliga a ganar si o si repito que no podemos darnos el lujo de dejar escapar puntos si ya no queremos estar en el fondo de nuestro sector
8041481 ma ana es fundamental ganar como sea en el partido pasado perdimos por nuestra responsabilidad y ahorita estamos m s comprometidos a obtener nuestro segundo triunfo del torneo para que conforme trascurran las pr ximas jornadas el equipo salga adelante
8041482 no podemos pensar en eso el torneo anterior fue malo pero en estos momentos hay que ver hacia adelante lo pasado es historia y hay que tomarlo como experiencia ahora tenemos que vivir el presente y para eso hay que trabajar fuerte y jugar los partidos como una final

8041490 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8041491 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8041492 we are pleased that we were able to reach this agreement
8041493 following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8041494 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now by doing things the way we did it
8041495 but when you look at the technology we now have and the new ballparks and even some of the old ballparks that have been reconfigured theres no question that it was a challenge to the umpires like anything else in life there are times when you need to make an adjustment

8041519 the acquisition reflects the companys strategy of investing and expanding in infrastructure opportunities in new zealand leveraging the groups strong financial position and solid experience in infrastructure
8041520 it aint just the speed its the heart you want something thats not afraid to compete half these horses are just show ponies you want something thats not gonna run from a fight
8041521 but i think on balance its the right thing to do i think its the right thing to do for the climate and for new zealands international reputation and even if its only a small bit of the right thing to do its still better than the wrong thing
8041522 no one could have expected that kind of result after only six years of operation
8041523 our very strong deposit growth enabled the bank to be largely self funded for residential and small business loans this reduced the banks exposure to the more expensive and volatile wholesale markets and enabled us to maintain competitive home loan rates in fact the bank continually led the market down in loan interest rates but still maintained some of the best term deposit and online call rates available
8041524 it is still signing up two thousand customers a week it is lending two billion more than it was a year ago deposits are up by nearly half the public are expressing their support for our bank very strongly
8041525 the only cloud on the horizon is the national partys secret promises behind closed doors to sell the bank
8041526 the financial result has been affected by new accounting procedures that change the way in which the profitability of loans is assessed the impact of that has been to increases last years profit but slightly constrain the result for this year but the really important fact is that the bank continues to increase profit month by month year by year
8041527 we clearly have struck a chord with small businesses in new zealand they like our rates and they like our service we are getting very solid growth in our business banking portfolio but at a level that we can ensure we maintain excellent service

8041534 todays meeting with the abilene chamber of commerce city council and other community leaders was productive and insightful
8041535 at the same time dyess air force base continues to be a source of pride and strength for the abilene community i had the opportunity to visit with col gass today who represented dyess air force base and the countless men and women who serve our country right here in abilene as well as in overseas theaters of combat i remain committed to ensuring that dyess has the tools it needs to accomplish its mission securing brand new c 130j super hercules aircraft as well as a new maintenance facility for our airmen to keep them flying are critical initiatives that will help ensure a strong role for dyess in our national defense for decades to come

8041619 arguably misplaced investment judgment where prospects of recovery are more remote and where cost exceeds market value
8041620 that is supported by substantial undrawn credit lines so gpg is well placed for selective buying opportunities
8041621 there is also a deferred tax adjustment of 22 million which is purely international financial reporting standards nonsense and can be safely disregarded as a legitimate inclusion in any proper analysis of the result

8041631 weve got a couple of in state games to just kick off the season and then we go out to l a and play usc and usc right now is ranked either 2 or 3 and were the other way so thats going to be our first real test
8041632 im sure rich is going to want to get in there and make a statement early in the rivalry with ohio state but he has to come to the shoe to play i mean hes got to come to ohio state this year first year out of the box thats tough for a coach
8041633 i would be surprised if ohio state lost more than 1 or 2
8041634 i think the big test is the usc game because its early in the season and the first test of where we are
8041635 well we only had three starting seniors last year and we lost those plus we lost a couple of undergrads to the nfl draft but jim tressel is a lot like phil fulmer these guys just reload i mean theyve got so much talent on the bench and ohio state did really well with their recruiting class from last year so theyre looking for a good year but im not sure i want to come back and play the sec again im not sure our record against the sec is 0 9 and i can tell you everybody down here reminds me of that every time its football season
8041636 people are always bringing me things from tennessee to display
8041637 i tell people john cooper was the best recruiter and the best monday to friday coach ohio state ever had
8041638 he would call a play that would require the defense to overplay its position to work in other words he would depend on them overcharging
8041639 well if you were a good coach and you had scouted ohio state you knew that if you told your players stay home play your position be disciplined youd stop them

8041652 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website

8041663 you need to be well armed with an array of plans for all situations
8041664 you need to spend time educating yourself so that youre prepared for all different types of markets
8041665 people hold on to losers because they dont want to admit theyre wrong they think things are going to get better
8041666 when you go into a trade you have to have some idea of when you get out of a trade
8041667 at the moment you enter a trade you should set that exit plan up
8041668 if you find yourself rooting for or cheering for your stock as if its a sports team you have to step back
8041669 when youre anxious and youre stressed you tend to overreact
8041670 that tends to escalate your anxiety and makes matters worse
8041671 its very hard at that moment to start applying these principles

8041724 condition of tarique rahman is improving as 24 hours have elapsed and his condition has not deteriorated further we can assume he is now out of danger but to remove confusion and anxiety ct scan test is necessary to ensure that his brain is not affected due to this injury as seeing is believing it is better to have a ct scan test to confirm that he is really out of danger but it is not our responsibility as jail authority is responsible for arranging this test however our ct scan machine remains out of order
8041725 when i talked to tarique rahman he did not tell me that he was feeling any problem

8041727 if the government did take care of tarique rahman properly and timely he would not slip in the bathroom at the prison cell of bangabandhu sheikh mujib medical university bsmmu hospital and receive injuries the government is responsible for tarique rahmans present vulnerable condition
8041728 the people want to know why the government is careless about begum zia and tarique rahman when a leader after her release is now visiting different foreign countries the government does not have any headache in releasing another leader begum khaleda zia who had been three times prime minister of the country

8041806 the number of people who are trying to make changes in the vaccination schedule based on what they have seen or read on the internet is climbing every year

8041814 more than 80 micrograms above the recommended limit for methylmercury a related compound

8041909 were willing to discuss in the framework of peace talks with lebanon any issue they want to bring to the table
8041910 obviously when we hold peace talks with the syrians and i hope we do have direct talks with the syrians then ultimately we have to agree to a border between our two countries so both sides will put their territorial visions on the table
8041911 if unifil solves it fine with us if hezbollah solves it fine with us in the end we want our land

8041922 it was not a step taken lightly or without full consideration of the consequences
8041923 ignoring russias warnings western countries rushed to recognise kosovos illegal declaration of independence from serbia
8041924 we argued consistently that it would be impossible after that to tell the abkhazians and ossetians and dozens of other groups around the world that what was good for the kosovo albanians was not good for them
8041925 in international relations you cannot have one rule for some and another rule for others
8041926 only a madman could have taken such a gamble did he believe russia would stand idly by as he launched an all out assault on the sleeping city of tskhinvali in south ossetia murdering hundreds of peaceful civilians most of them russian citizens
8041927 russia had no option but to crush the attack to save lives this was not a war of our choice we have no designs on georgian territory
8041928 i sincerely hope that the georgian people to whom we feel historic friendship and sympathy will one day have leaders they deserve who care about their country and who develop mutually respectful relations with all the peoples in the caucasus
8041929 in kurdistan there is no freedom for journalists i have proof of that the most recent proof was soran
8041930 we dont know who killed him but we do know that the government didnt care
8041931 the recent incidents have really stripped off the veneer and revealed its not much different than other parts of iraq
8041932 in kurdistan there isnt really a political opposition so the government thinks that journalists are the opposition
8041933 the problem you know with our journalists they think they are free to say anything and do anything
8041934 a free and independent press will make an important contribution to democratic development

8041946 estos tanques llegar n a la ciudad durante tres d as a la semana aunque existe un compromiso de si la situaci n de la sequ a se agrava asistirnos todos los d as de lunes a viernes
8041947 ahora con esta ayuda la planta descansar lunes mi rcoles y viernes y producir agua potable los cuatro d as restantes no es una soluci n definitiva pero es un paliativo en un momento muy dif cil
8041948 compromiso para que todo esto llegue a buen fin hemos relevado el estado de situaci n de cada sector todos coinciden en que debemos reforzar el tema de las ayudas estatales para que lleguen en tiempo y forma a los productores planteamos paliativos a corto mediano y largo plazo entre ellos el tema de los acueductos todo sirve como datos fehacientes de la zona para una futura reuni n que encararemos esta semana con el ministro de la producci n y el gobierno provincial

8041951 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8041952 i would say the water was about up to here
8041953 it came all the way up the basement steps and then it was all the way up to here
8041954 the sewers were not draining properly at all im always having back up of water out front here doesnt really drain that well
8041955 i think from a council members perspective i want to make sure were doing the right thing not necessarily getting insurance companies to make money but to make sure that if the city is liable and responsible for something that we pay that out
8041956 im not saying they should pay out all the claims obviously its not always the citys fault and the insurance company shouldnt pay it i just need to know which ones are our responsibility and make sure those get paid

8041963 we also dont know the extent of the outbreak yet and its really too soon to know now that coupled with the long incubation period makes this outbreak very concerning
8041964 both the numbers of suspected cases and confirmed cases will increase as this investigation continues
8041965 i think all of us expect that when we shop that the things we buy or that we eat are going to be safe
8041966 thats why i indicated that its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regimes

8042015 in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware
8042016 its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself
8042017 sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about the hardware and platforms
8042018 because mgs4 was optimized for the ps3 it is probably not possible to make the game in other formats
8042019 if were talking about the future not mgs4 but my future titles if the hardware technology rises then obviously you know it wont be based on the hardware anymore

8042117 and spoke words that have stayed with me ever since
8042118 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
8042119 the means and ends moralists constantly obsessed with the ethics of the means used by the have nots against the haves should search themselves as to their real political position in fact they are passive but real allies of the haves the most unethical of all means is the non use of any means the standards of judgment must be rooted in the whys and wherefores of life as it is lived the world as it is not our wished for fantasy of the world as it should be
8042120 my mind is full of razors to cut you like a word if only sung
8042121 i wish i could play normal matches and enjoy tennis sometimes
8042122 i think at the moment its a lot to ask for
8042123 its very exciting you try not to get too excited about it
8042124 ive played in a lot of big games before so im not going to try to build that up in my mind too much
8042125 im just going to go out there and do what we do im going to go out here and have a good practice today well get to do some philly prep at the end of practice and just take it one pass play at a time
8042126 i know ill get to play i dont know how much but i know im going to get the opportunity to play
8042127 we were running our four minute offense and they called a pass play down the field
8042128 in that situation you dont want to throw the ball away because then the clock stops and were trying to run the clock out you just get what you can and take the sack in that situation
8042129 i feel like i can make progress just from observing from the sideline each game i feel like ive gotten a little better whether ive played or not
8042130 it sounds funny but thats a testament to the coaching the sideline operation coach brian daboll and coach noel mazzone on the sidelines are always kind of helping me out even though they know im not playing
8042131 i cant try to do what he does in practice because physically what he can do with the football is amazing
8042132 you dont go out there and try to emulate him but you watch what he does what he thinks how he talks and how he carries himself without being a copycat you can really learn a lot from him
8042133 jim bob cooter our graduate assistant and me before our bowl game we were watching the packers play and he was making unreal throws off his back foot
8042134 then early in the first quarter of the bowl game i made a couple of throws falling away and across my body and they were complete
8042135 no stranger to big games or the spotlight the 65
8042136 ive been waiting patiently to get an opportunity to play and im just excited to have the opportunity its a privilege to play here not a right im going to try to make the most of my opportunity as long as it is and as many passes as it is
8042137 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8042138 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8042139 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8042140 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8042141 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8042142 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8042143 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8042144 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8042145 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8042146 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8042147 we will have to react somehow to react of course in a military way
8042148 there is nothing we find scaring this is true of the risk of a cold war too we do not want it though but in a situation like this all depends on our partners
8042149 if the west wishes to preserve a good relationship with russia then they will have to understand the reasons for our decision
8042150 lugar was surprised that he was willing to craft such a serious bill without much potential for media attention
8042151 what lugars staff felt was that obama was more substantive than he expected
8042152 the nuclear proliferation trip with lugar got bidens attention biden is enough old school and hes been around the senate long enough that he can spot someone he needs to pay attention to
8042153 there are always a few members who talk because they like the sound of their voice they dont ask good questions and dont listen to what came before so they ask the same question obama always seemed to take a new tack
8042154 he is not the kind of guy who does the washington cocktail party circuit
8042155 biden likes the people who take seriously the institution of the senate and the way it works and who are serious about getting things done
8042156 i dont think john mccain says these things because hes a bad person
8042157 i just dont think he gets it he is out of touch
8042158 john mccain is not promising to do anything different than george bush did
8042159 so if you think that the last eight years have been good then you need to go ahead and vote for him
8042160 i dont expect this will deter the obama campaign from misrepresenting my proposals but lest there be any doubt you have my pledge my reforms would not force anyone to go to a non va facility and do not signal privatization of the va
8042161 no challenge was too great for a world that stands as one
8042162 the cold war ended not because the world stood as one but because the great democracies came together bound together by sustained and decisive american leadership
8042163 and if he really thinks that by liberating iraq from a dangerous tyrant america somehow set a bad example that invited russia to invade a small peaceful and democratic nation then he should state it outright because that is a debate i welcome
8042164 about such questions only invites more trouble violence and aggression
8042165 when im president im going to have my attorney general go through every single executive order that george bush has issued and if there are laws that are unconstitutional then i am going to overturn them and were going to get our government back on track
8042166 under george bush they can wiretap you and read your e mails without checking off with a court and getting a warrant ahead of time even though the 4th amendment says you shouldnt be able to do that
8042167 there are a lot of people in there but one of the great things about america is we give even bad people due process so there are areas where we have gone too far

8042172 i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death
8042173 a man who will trade his liberty for a little temporary security deserves neither
8042174 you know that national health care sounds like a good idea a lot of people could use it
8042175 jerome there are two places i am confident you can find a lion today one is in africa in the country of kenya if you look around the serengeti long enough you will find one the other place you can find one is across the river in the louisville kentucky zoo
8042176 the zoo lion doesnt have to worry about being food or finding food
8042177 the only thing the lion had to give up to get all those benefits was his liberty americans are building their cage one bar at a time they arent going to notice until they hear the door slam shut by then it will be too late

8042258 apple makes a good operating system we dont deny that
8042259 this is about bringing leopard mac os x 10 5 to the masses
8042260 its not that people dont want to use mac os x but theyre not open to spending an exorbitant amount of money for something thats essentially generic hardware
8042261 every single copy of the os is a purchased copy
8042262 despite the allegations that theres a master disc thats not the case and allegations that psystar has somehow modified mac os xs code to run on non apple systems thats also not the case
8042263 there is no modification of any proprietary code of apples

8042265 no specific precedent but we wouldnt be filing this if we didnt believe we could support it
8042266 what we want to do is provide an alternative to apples hardware

8042301 in the past three decades chicago has undergone changes that are routinely described as gentrification but are in fact more complicated and more profound than the process that term suggests
8042302 t he deindustrialization of the central city for all the tragic human dislocations it caused has eliminated many of the things that made affluent people want to move away from it
8042303 the government has put this re competition on a very tight schedule
8042304 what you see here is the improbability of conducting a major competition in record time
8042305 this delay means the pentagon is taking its time to do the right thing
8042306 its a series of small things that cumulatively add up
8042307 its not about which administration is in charge at this point
8042308 can you meet a very aggressive hard deadline during this administration
8042309 what martin did diminishes the dignity of a human being
8042310 you cant just buy or rent life its even worse when someone famous and in the public eye is doing it
8042311 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8042312 the ontological view is that the human fetus is a person from the earliest moments of conception hence to abort it is either murder or something closely approximating murder the perversity view is that sex is only licit within marriage and for the primary purpose of having children hence abortion perverts sex and is immoral in the same way that contraception is immoral
8042313 there is not a unanimous tradition on this point and authors are as yet in disagreement
8042314 when those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine philosophy and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus the judiciary at this point in the development of mans knowledge is not in a position to speculate as to the answer
8042315 she needs public opinion in order to sustain a giving and taking between her members without this she cannot advance in thought and action
8042316 there is a sizable and growing number of catholic theologians who do disagree with some aspects of the officially proposed catholic teaching that direct abortion from the time of conception is always wrong
8042317 asserts that for a church law or rule to be an effective guide for the believing community it must be accepted by that community
8042318 the obligatory force of church law is affected by its reception by the community
8042319 reception is not a demonstration of popular sovereignty or an outcropping of populist democracy it is a legitimate participation by the people in their own governance
8042320 in every case i could show you 500 athletes we didnt show we dont show everyone we dont show every ceremony
8042321 not possible to cover the entire personal story of every athlete regarding their performance
8042322 having failed in its attempts to get our legal factual and fully supported ad off the air barack obamas campaign now wants to put our donors in prison for exercising their right to free speech
8042323 these over the top bullying tactics are reminiscent of the kind of censorship one would see in a stalinist dictatorship with the only difference being that those guys generally had to wait until they were in power to throw people who disagreed with them into jail
8042324 the trainers said today they felt he was like 95 to 100 percent
8042325 and sometimes with those injuries right when theyre starting to feel better its dangerous last week was that week so we tried to keep him from overdoing it
8042326 he made a nice play in a live situation last week which shows the explosion that we all enjoy seeing him have so i think brandon will be fine
8042327 hes missed practice time and practice is critical but hes going to be able to ease his way back into it

8042345 there is a growing consensus in government that those who run websites and blogs should be held accountable and this means that laws should be used to take action against those who defame and spread disinformation
8042346 if not we are going to have a situation where everyone will be free to make all sorts of allegations with no downside at all there is a fear that the trust level with bn would be very low if nothing is done said a senior government official familiar with details of the meeting

8042361 i think the end goal is to have a diagnostic method that can be used in an operating room to diagnose tumor tissue on a real time basis
8042362 the current methods of diagnosing tumor sample is taking out of the body and this method has the potential to make that a faster process that can be conducted in the operating room
8042363 as we were developing the instrumentation the idea of testing it on a different kind of material entirely that is fingerprints came up
8042364 were simply looking at fingerprints and telling what kind of chemical compounds are in the fingerprint
8042365 if the person has been handling cocaine or explosives then those molecules will be transferred with the fingerprint so then you can get the identity of the person along with what theyve touched recently
8042366 if two overlap each other those two would have touched different things
8042367 if one person touched cocaine and the other did not then those fingerprints will show up differently

8042374 theres a lot of buzz around town between the protesters and politicians and the delegates
8042375 todays theme is really unity and how we can bring together the country to change and barack obama has been a great agent of that

8042626 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8042627 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8042628 as far as wingnuts go dana is pretty goddamn well grounded

8042635 when the air temperature rises two to three degrees the arctic tundra would switch from a carbon sink to a carbon source
8042636 the greater the carbon stores the greater the impact it causes
8042637 warming will increase the decomposition rate of the soil organic matter and more carbon dioxide will be generated
8042638 warming will thaw the permafrost and release the sequestered carbon
8042639 we have to date identified all the members of wolfpack and they are very distinct from other youth in the area
8042640 it is not a particularly big group and we know who the offenders are and they are people who we are actively targeting as people who if they come under our attention will be treated with zero tolerance
8042641 we have a number of strategies in place to target these people and we are working through that now to keep their criminal behaviour to a minimum
8042642 certainly we share the same concerns as the community that these people are brought before the courts if they are breaking the law
8042643 shame on you barack obama enough with the speeches and the big rallies and then using tactics that are right out of karl roves playbook
8042644 senator obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail but he didnt start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president so when he had a chance to act on his speech he chose silence instead
8042645 last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take
8042646 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8042647 well you know senator obama it is very difficult having a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote and that has been a pattern
8042648 if we dont have universal health care we will be betraying the democratic partys principles sen obamas plan does not and cannot cover all americans
8042649 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8042650 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8042651 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future

8042728 i would like to make a request not only for this iit but on behalf of all the iits this is to do with reservations in faculty recruitment
8042729 the iits also have not had reservation for faculty since then it has recently been said the exemption for iits is only de facto
8042730 introducing reservation in faculty recruitment at iits after 36 years will create problems especially now as shortage of faculty is likely to become more acute with the establishment of 8 new iits
8042731 i take note of the point that prof gautam baruah has made with regard to the reservation issue i will bring it to the notice of my cabinet colleagues

8042735 i think its real important for all of us to witness this first hand and that not be afraid of it but also it does give you the awareness of what does take place at these conventions and the forces that are tense with one and other and so we need to be aware of that as citizens of a nation that believes in free speech and believes in keeping or that theres a balance between the two and so i think everyone should see it

8042741 well obviously its going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues and jerusalem will be part of those negotiations
8042742 as a practical matter it would be very difficult to execute and i think that it is smart for us to to work through a system in which everybody has access to the extraordinary religious sites in old jerusalem but that israel has a legitimate claim on that city

8042752 the framework convention of tobacco control says to work on strategies to reduce its supply is to control illicit trade and provide alternative employment the research and various studies done by the ctri have proved that these crops are as advantageous as tobacco
8042753 those involved in growing tobacco believe there will be a negative pattern financially if they start growing other crops
8042754 tobacco in all its forms is harmful and particularly a big contributor to non communicable diseases anti tobacco advocacy is the major task of the ministry and thats why we have flagged off the issue and have identified alternative crops
8042755 the state governments will have to be informed about the new research as the ministrys aim is to reduce tobacco usage which will go down only if the production goes down

8042777 as more americans use energy drinks weve seen a rise in products being launched with innovative new ingredients claims and consumer targets

8042886 los enemigos de garc a est n claramente dedicados a la demolici n de su imagen y garc a no est muy preocupado por cuidarla esto porque parece pensar que el crecimiento las obras y la publicidad de estas son cosas que hablan por s solas
8042887 han comenzado desde la izquierda algunos pedidos de un referendo a la boliviana para la revocatoria de alan garc a los alegatos son variados y est n vinculados sobre todo a la protesta social y a la baja aprobaci n del presidente se da por sentado que garc a no obtendr a la votaci n necesaria para quedarse en el cargo en las actuales circunstancias un pedido de revocatoria no es para hacerle un upgrade a luis giampietri hacia el sill n de pizarro sino con nimo de crear un nuevo escenario pol tico algo as como una crisis institucional donde el peso de las masas movilizadas en las calles pueda ser decisivo es poco probable que garc a est perdiendo sue o por este tema pero en t rminos generales s es posible imaginar a un garc a que se siente cada vez m s arrinconado por las circunstancias aquellas que puede manejar y aquellas que no su reacci n a esto todav a es impredecible pero existen algunas sospechas los pol ticos revocatorios deben estar pensando que lo m s conveniente para sus fines es irritar a garc a lo m s posible y luego citarlo taurinamente en las plazas de la protesta la extrema derecha debe estar mirando con gran inter s convencida de que un garc a super irritado podr a presidir la vuelta a una mano dura democr tico autoritaria en medio de esto venimos presenciando una suerte de guerra de la imagen que es unilateral los enemigos de garc a est n claramente dedicados a la demolici n de su imagen y garc a no est muy preocupado por cuidarla esto porque parece pensar que el crecimiento las obras y la publicidad de estas son cosas que hablan por s solas mientras tanto es notorio que la derecha m s autoritaria est dedicada a atacar a los sectores m s moderados de la izquierda lo cual les va despejando todav a m s la cancha a los sectores m s radicales y decididos la liquidaci n del centro y la consiguiente polarizaci n son una viej sima t ctica de estos sectores siempre encuentran quien les colabore

8042899 were willing to discuss in the framework of peace talks with lebanon any issue they want to bring to the table syrians and i hope we do have direct talks with the syrians then ultimately we have to agree to a border between our two countries so both sides will put their territorial visions on the table
8042900 if unifil solves it fine with us if hezbollah solves it fine with us in the end we want our land
8042901 we dont want hezbollah to liberate the farms for us we want the lebanese state to liberate it peacefully

8042904 when they see they are paying 80 to fill the tank of their car they really should feel like they have to do something
8042905 they have a way of kind of connecting and being comfortable with uh with their fellow riders
8042906 the experience has been great i found someone who lives really close to me and we really hit it off well
8042907 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8042908 it has shaken my confidence what would that be why would that be happening
8042909 it could be any location because one facility is now processing flight data for everybody
8042910 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8042911 there are cancellations due to weather from the hurricane but not due to this
8042912 were not going to be intimidated into voting for someone we dont think is qualified
8042913 i just needed to let it out im angry about what happened to hillary so many women my age thought it was our time
8042914 shes saying that shes going to vote for obama i had thought she wished everyone would vote for obama
8042915 hillary to her credit is really stepping up to the plate i have my heartache i have all the qualms about maybe i should have done this maybe i should have said that but its so important to win that we all have to do our part
8042916 i think well all come out incredible united because we are fortunate enough to have another great leader sen hillary clinton
8042917 we had our battle in the primary no one was more committed to sen clinton than me
8042918 people who support hillary clinton will get on board and be united to defeat sen john mccain and the republican party in november
8042919 im upset i dont like it and i dont approve of it and the republicans are going to lose in november
8042920 as an old political hand i can tell you it never works then the candidate the person used in the ads comes out and says theyre full of it and the real truth is boom and hillary will do that
8042921 most of us came in on the redeyes catching up
8042922 its really fun to be staying with clintons hometown as well as biden
8042923 god willing with the goodwill of the parties and the tireless work of the parties we have a good chance of succeeding
8042924 there are benefits that i hope will show in the future

8042934 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8042935 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8042936 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8042937 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8042938 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success

8042948 a major requirement of the hana financial group was to select a standards based authentication solution the actividentity mini token was selected as it complies with the oath open standard providing compatibility with 3rd party software and assurance of future proofing as industry requirements move over time

8042995 creo que la discusi n ha sido muy importante porque tarde o temprano se avanzar en esa direcci n no se puede dejar espacios herm ticamente cerrados al avance tecnol gico y al mercado eso mantiene el atraso y la miseria

8043010 with climate change and globalisation the ageing of the population is one of the major challenges europe must face
8043011 from 2015 onwards deaths would outnumber births and population growth due to natural increase would cease
8043012 positive net migration would be the only population growth factor however from 2035 this positive net migration would no longer counterbalance the negative natural change
8043013 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8043014 but we dont want it and in this situation everything depends on the position of our partners
8043015 if they want to preserve good relations with russia in the west they will understand the reason behind our decision
8043016 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8043017 georgia chose the least human way to achieve its goal to absorb south ossetia by eliminating a whole nation
8043018 under the decree recognizing independence of both republics which i have signed our country will help abkhazia and south ossetia to ensure their security and if they are attacked we will certainly offer them appropriate support
8043019 a special case in kosovo a special case in abkhazia and south ossetia
8043020 until recently we tried to help restore georgias state unity but the last nail was driven in following georgias decision to attack
8043021 as to our involvement in other conflicts we naturally are not going to do this
8043022 however russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the entire length of its border this is absolutely clear
8043023 felt it was important to have the vice president consult with allies in the region on our common security interests

8043029 communication systems are being restored units are planned for deployment in the military towns of gori and senaki
8043030 according to our information they are even starting to supply new types of weapons restoring the military infrastructure that was used in the aggression
8043031 virtually all states that are supplying arms to georgia are nato member countries
8043032 these weapons which were supplied to georgia both overtly and covertly were eventually used against russian citizens
8043033 measures are being taken with assistance from nato experts to create facilities for airspace control and to restore airfields
8043034 increased activity of natos naval forces in the black sea
8043035 the russian black sea fleet continues providing security in the waters of the black sea near the shore of abkhazia
8043036 to implement a strategy of diversification in the energy sphere
8043037 energy departments and companies of the two countries are working actively to promote pipeline projects to supply crude oil and natural gas from russia to china
8043038 a very high level and laid a better foundation for the future development

8043063 is welcome but it is trivial compared to the plunge over the past year
8043064 users will never need more than 10mbps to the home
8043065 we need to send another woman to congress from new york state time to stand up to special interests time to make government accountable to communities families to the people
8043066 i am change i will be first woman from my district to head down to washington
8043067 i will work side by side with you for the next 30 years to ensure pay equity a womans right to choose that president bush cannot say that contraception is a form of abortion
8043068 i want to tell you about stephanie tubb jones 2 representative debbie wasserman schultz and the third is hillary clinton let me tell you what she did for me in october 2006 she did a fundraiser that carolyn maloney attended hillary and bill clinton separately called me to tell me id won that race she called a second time we need women like that women who are organized who are there for the long haul what the people need from all of us running is leadership its the leadership thats missing from this country and all the issues ive been a banker for 40 years i understand fully you win by the power of money at the grassroots level at this this is such a wonderful new idea of the pac that you started my oppononent is one of the wealthiest people in congress this time my opponent has had lawsuits filed against him in the last 90 days i need your help im going to represent you help me get there and thank you for the opportunity
8043069 thank you for supporting women count we all saw the importance that they played in the historic race of hillary rodham clinton adn the candidatees they are supporting we will not stop until the population is 51 of congress and the corporate boards and every other area of society
8043070 i had a dream about my good friend hillary rodham clinton she was dressed in purple like the suffragettes and she was in a meeting with justice roberts and justice alito and she won the argument
8043071 its a national scandal that we still do not have health care for the 9 11 rescue workers hillary will see to it that they and everyone will have health care
8043072 her candidacy was the best of times and the worst of times im so proud of her she gained she earned 18 million votes and she raised more money than any other candidate in history except barack obama i am standing taller and i believe every woman is standing taller thank you hillary cliinton for being there and running and doing so well
8043073 but it was also the worst of times for women because we saw the dark underbelly of sexism and misogyny and like ginger rogers who did everything backwards and in high heels women have more barriers to break someone should write a book about women who have come so far yet still have obstacles
8043074 as madeline albright says theres a special place in hell for women who dont help other women
8043075 i share with you that we have not passed a family friendly law since 1993 the family leave act 15 years most families need the second income even though we only earn 73 cents to the dollar we can get out there and make that difference it is up to the women it is up to you vote for yourself vote for a woman thank you for supporting this organization
8043076 tonight will be a fantastic celebration of hillary clintons candidacy
8043077 we need you to join us in this movement to get this organization launched with some of the most amazing women ive worked with
8043078 this team with your help if you join our team we will not just get language on sexism and gender bias on the democratic platform well get it on the republican platform
8043079 as the director of womens outreach for the dnc i met this woman the first african american woman to become a congresswoman and i was nervous i remember that stephanie walked into that room and the first thing i noticed were her shoes stephanie always wore comfortable shoes because the fight she was engaged in in her lifetime she had to be comfortable she was kicking when necessary and this woman when she walked into my office she extended her arms with the biggest hug and the biggest smile for ten years i had the opportunity to be mentored by her to learn from her but the last year when she picked up the phone and with a nudge and a bigger push said you have to speak out for senator clinton and we need your voice if stephanie was in this fight i was in this fight it is for stephanie and stephanies cause that we are now launching this organization
8043080 i have served in the senate and i do not want to see progress subverted for four more years with a republican in the white house but what it so great about our country is we dont sit around wiaiting for our government to do things thats where citizen activism has always made a difference the march toward womens suffrage that ended in 1920 with the passage of the 19th amendment started in 1848 with the womens rights convention in new york
8043081 womencount will continue to stand up against the pervasive bias that we saw in the media womencount will continue to stand up and be a voice for those who feel that they are left out and left behind there is so much work to be done and this is exciting and energizing work
8043082 i will be there with you i will work with you
8043083 we have made a lot of progress but we have a lot more to do so join with us be part of this ongoing effort to realize the promise of america and the lives of americans
8043084 i thought i was gonna die that they were gonna shoot me
8043085 they said close the door you f g a e
8043086 still they were charging hitting kicking they never stopped i fell on the ground
8043087 someone said hes bleeding and i looked into the chamber of a gun
8043088 they were arrested theyve been suspended their weapons have been taken away from them and the investigation continues
8043089 whats the big deal a little yelling and hollering get over it
8043090 hed like to put it behind him at this point it was a scary episode for the family
8043091 usually a flea that bites an infected animal a rodent a prairie dog a squirrel and then bites a human
8043092 the scout was not contagious it was caught in stage one there was no chance of someone else catching the disease from him
8043093 and i think this goes for both star trek and doctor who is that neither of them are remakes
8043094 i often see star trek being referred to as a remake and it really isnt
8043095 its another star trek film its another movie in the series its the continuing mission
8043096 in some senses it is a prequel but the word i would use which is how damon lindelof describes it is a re invigoration or re vitalization
8043097 the only cast member from the original films is nimoy
8043098 people come down and get the essentials or get gas
8043099 the entry team went in and found the fire put the fire out
8043100 the thing is now we have smoke throughout the whole store
8043101 the suicide bombing of jalawla is striking evidence that iraqi security forces are unable to impose security on the area from which peshmerga have just withdrawn
8043102 the scale of violence will increase in the coming days
8043103 theyre committed to an election well before then if theyre clearly committed to that course of action and i think they are then it behooves the government to provide some responsibility
8043104 as this next generation workforce get recruited into your company they expect to use the equipment and applications that theyre used to
8043105 they have a deep affinity to social networking they have loyalty to their mobile devices over corporate issued equipment and they have an instinct to share information that poses a challenge for us said craig scroggie vice president pacific region symantec
8043106 so today workers in general are inclined to put corporate data on their own pcs and are comfortable to share personal info online
8043107 the first wave of virtualisation focused on specific platforms and hardware such as storage servers networks and desktops
8043108 as virtualisation becomes commoditised the next wave of this technology will change the way software is managed delivered and consumed at the endpoint thereby improving user productivity while reducing it complexity
8043109 when aunt is dead her terrified hands will lie still ringed with ordeals she was mastered by
8043110 why should he even care that others cause calamity by their lifeless imitations
8043111 you do not eat that rips the heart with joy
8043112 i cannot believe in you however i will continue compulsively counting
8043113 the dscc has made it clear this is a race theyre targeting and so far their efforts are paying off
8043114 al ruwaya will be one of the most exclusive golf clubs around the globe this exclusivity will be ensured by a very strict limit on memberships along with a limit on the number of rounds played annually
8043115 you agree not to install use or run the apple software on any non apple labeled computer or to enable others to do so
8043116 wir brauchen beispielsweise die sicherheit dass eine neue regierung nicht ohne beschlossenen landeshaushalt dasteht
8043117 ich will nicht ost gegen west ausspielen oder eine neidkampagne starten aber wir m ssen jetzt umsteuern
8043118 ich hoffe dass sich die erkenntnis durchsetzt nicht nach himmelsrichtungen zu f rdern
8043119 merrill hat das gleiche gemacht und ich denke ein paar andere werden diesem trend der bereinigung noch folgen

8043121 while we are extremely pleased with the results obtained from the work undertaken to date on our three marketed and seven pipeline drugs four of which are moving towards commercial release we feel this success is not yet represented in shareholder value
8043122 we have invested heavily in the respective successful development of our products now we need assistance in developing our companys share valuation
8043123 collectively these developments have substantially increased the value of sinobiomed which has seen a dramatic corresponding increase in market capitalization of nearly 200
8043124 we have therefore retained cb capital partners as our financial advisor to assist in reviewing our strategic alternatives with the objective of maximizing shareholder value and we look forward to working with them to ensure that all alternatives available to the company are considered and evaluated to achieve that objective
8043125 the geographical overlap between regions of opium and zones of insurgency shows the inextricable link between drugs and conflict
8043126 since drugs and the insurgency are caused by and effect each other they need to be dealt with at the same time and urgently
8043127 member states have yet to demonstrate willingness to comply with the security councils decisions for example by seeking extradition of the criminals who sow death among their youth
8043128 in helmand for example we did not have proper force protection
8043129 that decision is being taken now because the planting season is in october and this is where my worries come in
8043130 i hope this decline in cultivation will be a trend but i would rather see it as a golden opportunity for the government and the international community to go in with massive investment in agriculture and rural development in a much more concerted way than they have done before to those areas which are poppy free or close to poppy free
8043131 they can last for the rest of the year but next year if they dont see that somebody will come to their rescue they could go back to growing opium
8043132 we are in contact with libyan officials because of this dangerous event
8043133 we want to resolve this situation as soon as we can in a way where we can guarantee the safety of all our passengers
8043134 there were no signs of any terrorist or criminal activity on the plane
8043135 we checked the plane like we do with all other planes we followed the regular security checkup we still dont have any information on what type of weapons were used
8043136 early in the morning monday we started getting reports from our staff who live in the camp that armed vehicles were coming to the edges of the camp on different sides then at about 9 15 in the morning they called us to say they could hear heavy shooting and we started receiving casualties in our clinic so by the end of the day we had 65 people with gunshot wounds in our clinic
8043137 its early to say who was behind the attack we are looking into all aspects
8043138 they the militants believe this force has become a stooge promoting someone elses agenda
8043139 the us is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk democratic peoples republic of korea as it pleases just as it did in iraq
8043140 we have decided to immediately suspend disabling our nuclear facilities
8043141 i would say some people thought we were going to die
8043142 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping
8043143 i sent my mum a text i love you and i am going down
8043144 for about half an hour no one told us anything we didnt know what was happening at all we were quite panicky
8043145 after half an hour we were told to take the oxygen mask off and then the plane landed and we were fine
8043146 we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew deploy their oxygen masks and they cant be making pa announcements while they have their oxygen masks on
8043147 one thing that can happen is that the outflow valve can fail and become open so all the air rushes out
8043148 a hole can appear because some damage was done which nobody notices and because of the constant stress of pressurising and depressurising the cabin it becomes bigger over time
8043149 what we had in these cases was jet jockeys deciding i am better than ryanair sops standard operating procedures we dont want anybody doing that
8043150 it has the youngest fleet of aircraft in europe and their maintenance organisation is first class

8043168 the roughriders are excited to work along with the black hawks on this project
8043169 there has been a sign in downtown cedar rapids during the flood recovery that reads we will rise above the face off for flood relief is a step towards that in both of our communities and efforts to aid the recovery will continue in the months to come
8043170 we stood shoulder to shoulder with residents and business owners while sandbagging and were amazed by the positive outlook shown by those who were facing the possibility of losing everything
8043171 this is a great way to help those people get back to normal as quickly as possible
8043172 its not so much that were afraid of change or so in love with the old ways but its that place in between that we fear

8043178 we have an additional 20 million in state borrowing guarantees we went from 50 million to 70 million
8043179 were already using 5 million of that for the tax exempt borrowing that leaves 15 million available
8043180 if we took 1 million out of the revolving credit line the amount eligible for state guarantee would be 14 million
8043181 if we paid back the 1 million and then borrowed another 2 million we would have only 12 million left in the state guarantee

8043200 palm trees to me well they beautify my property and i think this is a wonderful thing its south florida and you expect to see palm trees
8043201 thats crazy you spend too much money making your place look nice and they come and take your palms out thats not good
8043202 one palm frond contacting a power line could literally put 100 customers out of power until were able to restore it
8043203 to see them have to go would be hard for me because i love my palm trees its a shame
8043204 we charge a flat rate for our services minus the sales tax
8043205 i dont think its a good way for government to do business
8043206 were now facing an additional 1 2 billion budget shortage
8043207 im not saying lets overturn half or whatever percentage all im saying is lets examine them lets review them
8043208 the sad thing is theres money out there but its just not being collected
8043209 so people who can afford 600 tickets these are tax free meanwhile we all pay for it theres no free lunch here we pay for it through property taxes
8043210 do you think the public would rather have real property tax relief or tax relief for ostrich feed and luxury skyboxes you choose
8043211 its going to make our farmers less competitive could result in businesses moving off shore

8043235 instead of the ignorance is bliss approach that was the norm in the past firms are becoming more diligent about investigating breaches

8043363 our two first half goals settled the tie and then we played some great stuff in the second half
8043364 it was great to see jon daly get a hat trick but the finishing of both strikers was first class
8043365 we did well in the early part of the game and posed them a problem or two at times but the longer it went on the more difficult it got for us and in the end we were well beaten although some of dundee uniteds finishing was lethal
8043366 we now want to put that into action in our forthcoming fixtures
8043367 the plaintiffs maintain that separating the misbehaving dilatory defendants into a time out group will help them settle the hensley case with the supposedly well behaved defendants

8043381 describes the whole of maori society as violent and dangerous this is a clearly racist view claiming a whole ethnic group has these traits
8043382 i think its just very sad that its come to this stage that when you write about certain topics in new zealand history you get complaints and accusations of racism levelled at you
8043383 hes looked at no maori language evidence nothing from the maori land court he sets that all aside and makes a giant sized conclusion about pre european maori society thats based on the view of a few europeans

8043422 if it is limited to fair and foul balls i think it is ok

8043429 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8043430 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game

8043452 theyd received 30 bodies of dead recruits a higher figure than police reported to mcclatchy newspapers
8043453 i saw burned bodies wounded people and small pools of blood
8043454 there was black smoke everywhere dead bodies on the ground and people panicking and helping to transfer the injured to the hospital
8043455 today the multinational corps iraq is operating in more areas of the country with fewer troops and our security gains continue to trend in a positive direction even after the redeployment of five brigade combat teams and most recently the georgian brigade weve been able to achieve this success because of an increasingly effective iraqi security force one that is growing in capability and in confidence
8043456 the suicide bombing of jalawla is striking evidence that iraqi security forces are unable to impose security on the area from which peshmerga have just withdrawn
8043457 the suicide bombing of jalawla is striking eveidence that iraqi security forces are unable to impose security on the are from which pershmerga have just withdrawn
8043458 this is the latest in a series of attacks launched mainly by sunni islamists in diyala
8043459 the attack followed a suicide bombing on sunday night at a tribal sheiks banquest in the western baghdad suburb of abu ghraib
8043460 prime minister nouri malikis negotiators are also bogged down in talks over a long term security agreement with the united states despite a december deadline looming for a deal the shiite led government has also initiated a crackdown on leaders and members of the u s funded sons of iraq movement which includes many former insurgents who allied themselves with america in 2007 to fight al qaeda in iraq since may iraqi security forces have started arresting sunni fighters leaders from the sons of iraq have warned that the measures could drive some of their men back to fighting the government
8043461 fixed deadline for the departure of all u s troops troops from iraq
8043462 his words appeared to rule out the presence of any u s military advisors special forces and air support after the withdrawal date
8043463 a direct challenge to the bush administration which insists that the timing for troop departure would be based on conditions on the ground
8043464 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
8043465 than an agreed upon 2011 date is for combat forces only
8043466 despite the tough words aides insisted a compromise could be found on the two main stumbling blocks to an accord governing the u s military presence in iraq after a united nations mandate expires at the end of the year
8043467 the general manager of the health administration dr hassan zein al abideen
8043468 a police official says the bomb was planted in a car parked on a street used by local government officials going to work
8043469 but it is usually the job of the party nominee to build unity once a vanquished rival has conceded and made the right gestures unless the loser happens to be a woman then its just like high school and she must do the work
8043470 we must have an opposition party in this country and the green party with over 200 elected officials on the local level can be that opposition but we have to expand and broaden the green party to reflect the entire fabric of all of the communities that are in this country we have done a great job of reaching out to people of all diverse backgrounds and we wanted to make sure that people understood that not only is green party a viable alternative it is imperative

8043481 its ironic that just as regulators are breaking up one monopoly baa british airways and american airlines are trying to create another our results prove that consumers want choice on transatlantic routes unless the regulators block the proposed ba aa monopoly consumers will lose out and theyll pay higher ticket prices for the privilege
8043482 while the outlook remains pretty overcast for the aviation industry the winners will be those airlines that focus on offering the best customer service and which are nimble enough to take advantage of the opportunities that lie ahead our strategy of slowing our growth has paid off in time for the slowdown in the industry against the backdrop of high oil prices and weakening consumer demand we are well placed to succeed over the coming months we have diversified our route network focused on providing the best product in upper class premium economy and economy hedged our fuel purchasing and built up a strong cash position

8043484 whether it is big or small will depend on how hard qantas comes back to respond to air nzs pricing moves
8043485 virgin blues decision is likely to be seen as a better financial option than purely parking the planes while the additional capacity on the sydney auckland route will place downward pressure on yields for both air nz and qantas
8043486 at this stage however we are unlikely to see a virtual replay of the surge in trans tasman capacity seen in 2003 05 where capacity increased about 17 per cent and yields fell by about 20 per cent

8043493 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8043494 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8043495 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8043496 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8043497 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8043498 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8043499 weve had five people come forward that formed part of the initial investigation
8043500 and as a consequence to those five people coming forward weve identified another eight people so at this stage were speaking to 13 people
8043501 what we can say at this stage is that there is a number of lines of inquiry that have come from the initial inquiries
8043502 there are a number of inquiries continuing and there are some suspects involved

8043524 does he really know what hes getting himself into and the answer is of course i do
8043525 they have to care about themselves and their families first i think its a process of bringing excellence into everything you do
8043526 every parent should expect that and they will get security for students and security for teachers
8043527 we need more control and maybe a little bit more security
8043528 i feel with an administration and teachers who care youll get the kids to care and thats what we need
8043529 they have to care about themselves and their families first i think its a process of bringing excellence into everything you do
8043530 i didnt realize i was wounded for about a minute or so then after we got done i patched my own self up
8043531 the gear we have now is the safest weve ever had
8043532 theyll stop machine gun rounds from coming and hurting anybody your parents are a lot safer than what i was before
8043533 one of the main messages we try to get out at camp is that kids serve too
8043534 we want them to understand that we recognize theyre making sacrifices
8043535 military kids have so much more stress than regular kids worrying about their parents having to take care of the parent thats at home more responsibility
8043536 its very sad when he goes away because you dont really know when theyll come back sometimes theyll come back in six months but sometimes it ends up being a year
8043537 the military is getting better at taking care of the families but you guys just dont know what were going into and i know theres got to be a lot of fear and uncertainty
8043538 rendell may have offered a back handed compliment when he compared obama to adlai stevenson the failed democratic candidate from the 1950s who captured the imagination of american intellectuals but not the electorate at large
8043539 you ask him a question and he gives you a six minute answer and the six minute answer is smart as all get out its intellectual its well framed it takes care of all the contingencies but its a lousy soundbite
8043540 i got religion just not the kind that i think obama would appreciate
8043541 he had degenerative disc disease so they were giving him pain medication for that
8043542 those are the last two on board and theyre the most powerful
8043543 they tell you dont drive a motor vehicle but you can go shoot a machine gun on percocet
8043544 they think ive developed a seizure disorder in my left hand where it does what it wants to when it wants to from my fingertips all the way up to my shoulder it bounces all over the place
8043545 i dont feel like an active person i could care less about actually leaving the house now
8043546 he looked older he was drinking at night he told me horrific stories then hed go to bed and id just sit there and cry
8043547 i think that was the catalyst that threw chad over the edge body parts of friends the women and the kids he killed that got him
8043548 i believe he had been lying there for three days
8043549 the normal maximum dose would be about 800 milligrams a day
8043550 paxil and seroquel he had been taking klonopin he was taking pain medicines you should not die from taking pain medicine with ptsd
8043551 he was physically fit he had a clear head he was calm he was easygoing he was funny everyone wanted to be around him
8043552 it got to the point where he wouldnt even pick up the phone when they called
8043553 everything from slurred speech to excessive weight gain inability to urinate he would shake developed tremors in his hands every weekend he came home it was something more noticeable
8043554 a tendency of young returning veterans to self medicate using nonprescribed prescription medication obtained from friends family members and co workers
8043555 there is no question that overdoses of the combination of multiple medications often combined with narcotics alcohol or illegal drugs can result in death
8043556 some of the deaths have been ruled suicides and others accidental overdoses we are not aware of deaths that have occurred when soldiers were taking their medicines as prescribed
8043557 i felt like they treated him like he was a malingerer that there was nothing wrong with him that he was just a pain in their ass to be honest with you
8043558 hed still be alive had they not given him that crap and he would have been medically retired and he probably would have lived a comfortable life
8043559 it really upsets me that nothings been done about it
8043560 the lessons learned here will be translated throughout the va system
8043561 the most important thing is what you do when you realize you have a problem
8043562 the lessons learned here will be translated throughout the veterans affairs system
8043563 it is a testimony to the responsiveness of the va that they have taken this seriously and they have been open with the press and public
8043564 the staff at the dallas va has demonstrated they are committed to making significant improvements to the facility and the level of care provided i was pleased to see progress under way and will continue to closely monitor these enhancements
8043565 now we know what russians really wanted now it is clear that it is not about abkhazia and south ossetia it is about georgia and russia know we know it is about russian imperialism now we know that it is about russias ambitions so i think that it is high time for the west to understand that this is not about only georgias job but it is largely should be the concern of the west because it is a war of values
8043566 we need help from the whole world president medvedev must not decide about independence of ossetia and abkhazia
8043567 the only place these people want to be is home and they cannot go home because of what has happened to them and because the situation that the russians have caused our goal as humanitarians is to do the best we can to give them a solid life with food clothing and self esteem until we can get them back into their homes
8043568 im having a great time and this is an awesome experience
8043569 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 men and 15 women

8043579 it may seem unusual to somebody who is not in the industry but its becoming more and more commonplace people are appreciating trees a lot more and theyre more aware of the significance of larger secure trees
8043580 why dont we have this other people have requested a similar program so i know there is interest
8043581 other parts havent been updated since 1960 and 1990 basically the ordinance is incredibly old and out of date with current urban forestry standards
8043582 we would probably advise on development of a program if there was any management of it we would have to figure it out its very specialized it depends on what would go with it sometimes the designation is completely honorary its sort of a different animal you cant manage trees like you manage historic buildings we probably would have to look at practices of other organizations and cities maybe its something that comes out of raimes office it may or may not affect any future action involving a tree it may be a pure recognition piece all those things are possible the landmarks commission could potentially be a reviewing body but we dont have an arborist on the commission raime is the citys expert
8043583 the fact of the matter is that tacoma has some very spectacular examples of heritage trees
8043584 we have many champion trees especially in wright park its something that in the past ive been surprised hasnt come up before
8043585 these trees are ones that are recognized and people sort of consider them to be iconic
8043586 people know oh the big chestnut tree they are aware of it in fact i think they would probably want to register more of them i get a number of calls from people who are upset when large trees are taken down
8043587 i would like to make sure these trees are protected and they remain as long as they are viable trees
8043588 investigators have assumed that asthma is not a complication of pediatric hiv infection because studies conducted before haart was introduced in the mid 1990s did not detect the problem

8043593 painters like giotto and michelangelo have painted the history of italy the story of the renaissance i am small by comparison
8043594 but i hope i can paint for pisa something they will cherish and remember and who knows in the future they might even be talking about my work
8043595 as the plaster dries the colours take on different shades the painting must begin immediately after the plaster is applied the painting must be exact and i must work fast
8043596 i have told some people to go away three or four times said the artist
8043597 ive tried various ways to tell them why they have not been chosen
8043598 i am looking for certain types of character in the casting sessions every face is studied carefully before the final selection is made
8043599 its a medieval nose perhaps it was also my stature
8043600 i will be painted in as part of the crowd that looks on as st ranierus performs one of his miracles
8043601 to be honest i dont really care where i am in the painting the fresco will be there for centuries to come and my face will be on that wall long after i have gone
8043602 with fresco painting like this there can be no mistakes
8043603 you put on your square of plaster you take a deep breath and you do it
8043604 and it doesnt matter if you are michelangelo or the badly paid assistant you just do it and you do it as quickly as you can
8043605 if you make a mistake the only way to change it is to take an axe and pull it off the wall this sort of painting sorts the men from the boys
8043606 but i take my hat off to him its wonderful that a young painter has the drive to do it and is prepared to take the risk

8043609 but when we start seeing the increase in complaints i think it speaks to the willingness of residents to get involved a little more
8043610 i guess im just a little surprised that people dont understand how easy i think it is for a young person such as myself to see a negative situation as positive
8043611 i mean i dont know if i see it as positive but im not complaining about it

8043669 it is clear that tech savvy travelers display a significantly different market profile than travelers who are less wired
8043670 they not only suggest the need for a fresh approach to media strategies that will reach this growing audience but raise provocative questions about the influence of the user generated content that is now flourishing online
8043671 he thought apparently the dvd case was a great spot to hide it from me and it was
8043672 a job intermittently fulfilling and annoying with not enough vacation days
8043673 they are constituents of mine they have a huge facility in hemet and if they come in with a legitimate concern then i will address it
8043674 its something that i will watch i know the d a and sheriff here quite well we will look into it
8043675 they are constituents of mine they have a huge facility in hemet and if they come in with a legitimate concern then i will address it
8043676 its something that i will watch i know the d a and sheriff here quite well we will look into it
8043677 as an african american and a lesbian i havent been through one day without facing some sort of discrimination but this is just shocking
8043678 they would be as a call to train ten thousand english to their side
8043679 baked laptop why storing valuables in the oven is a bad idea
8043680 i didnt even know the dnc was in town i dont watch the news
8043681 the save fort rock farm circle anticipated the motion to be removed due to standing in todays hearing we remain fully committed to preserving and protecting the environment the fragile ecosystems of the squamscott river the estuaries of great bay and the historic fort rock farm site
8043682 just because a case is so fully and hotly contested by both highly competent counsel and others just because all that occurred it doesnt mean the decision below is unlawful or unreasonable
8043683 it is in exactly these cases where there is full opportunity to be heard full review if they go through the process right and people participate thats what the process requires the process doesnt require any particular decision
8043684 we have by hell at least gaind liberty thats worth our fall thus low tho we are driven better to rule in hell than serve in heaven
8043685 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
8043686 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined
8043687 by sale or other transfer of ownership or by rental lease or lending
8043688 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
8043689 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
8043690 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
8043691 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
8043692 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
8043693 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
8043694 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
8043695 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
8043696 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
8043697 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
8043698 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
8043699 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
8043700 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
8043701 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
8043702 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

8043715 het eerste doelpunt zal morgen heel belangrijk worden en we zullen proberen die eerste goal te maken
8043716 van die wedstrijd hebben we enorm veel geleerd na afloop realiseerden de spelers zich dat ze de kans hadden gehad arsenal te verslaan
8043717 die 2 0 lijkt een betere uitgangspositie dan het in werkelijkheid is het gevaar is dat we het te gemakkelijk opvatten fc twente zal defensief weer goed georganiseerd spelen
8043718 ik eis van mijn team dat ze morgen scherp aan de aftrap staan voor de wedstrijd tegen twente

8043754 sightseeing tours are a great and easy way for agents to make domestic flight bookings more profitable as they all offer good levels of commission
8043755 however our research shows over 40 per cent of our day tour passengers book their sightseeing tours independently which means that agents are missing out on 40 per cent of the commission available within this market

8043800 the move to new yorks jfk airport is in response to passenger demand flying to one of americas premier airports on the us east coast
8043801 qatar airways is committed to the swiss market and is delighted with the huge response and popularity of our geneva service which has enabled us to add capacity as the four times a week non stop service from doha using an airbus a330 aircraft becomes a dedicated route
8043802 passengers from geneva and neighbouring cities will be able to take advantage of our excellent array of onward connections over doha to key business and leisure cities to the far east and south asia
8043803 for the immediate future our existing flights to zurich will continue to operate four times a week but we will shortly be announcing additional frequencies to both zurich and geneva with effect from 2009 offering yet more choice for both business and leisure travellers

8043867 the big concern is that overexploitation is causing the fish to evolve the finding that humans can actually cause evolution of fish populations which in turn can drive their degradation is relatively new and is drawing a lot of attention
8043868 some fisheries including that for cod are now known to cause juvenescence or the evolution of younger smaller adult fish the ecological and economic consequences both appear to be negative
8043869 with cod populations at historic lows and challenges to rebuild them mounting it is important to explore the past for clues about characteristics such as stock sizes exploitation rates age and size structure etc and what ecological roles cod would have played when their populations were larger

8043875 over the past 10 years theres been a revolution of sorts in studying protein function in living systems using microscopy to follow dynamic movements and localizations of particular protein molecules
8043876 they give off multiple colors and whats particularly useful technologically is that it takes a longer time between when theyre excited with a light pulse and the time they fluoresce
8043877 one purpose of our studies is to demonstrate that we can detect lanthanide reporter tagged proteins at the single molecule limit in living cells
8043878 you add them to cell cultures and they go into cells find the protein you want to study and bind with high affinity its a straightforward way to selectively label a protein and makes it detectable
8043879 we are greatly encouraged by our findings because the nearly half of the children on the diet were either able to maintain healthy cholesterol or gradually metabolized the extra fat and returned to somewhat normal cholesterol levels
8043880 this means the benefits of the diet a diet that is lifesaving in many children and therapeutic in most of them continue to outweigh the risks
8043881 i put him in there just to give him a role i want to play as many guys as possible
8043882 i just wanted to see what he could do and let him enjoy practice a little bit hes not the starter going into the first ball game so it gives him a role we may use him in that capacity if we need to
8043883 i dont care how much talent a team has if the boys dont think tough practice tough and live tough how can they play tough on saturday
8043884 our evidence indicates the earliest inhabitants of palau were of normal stature and it counters the evidence that berger et al presented in their paper indicating there was a reduced stature population in early palau
8043885 our research from whole bones and whole skeletons indicates that the earliest individuals in palau were of normal stature but gracile in other words they were thin
8043886 i think bergers primary mistakes were his not understanding the variation in the skeletal population in which he was working using fragmentary remains again in a situation where he didnt understand variation and stepping outside his own area of expertise which i think all scientists try not to do but sometimes we do
8043887 although we have not seen the material that berger et al base their results on we can speak to the diversity and normalcy of human skeletal series from throughout the archipelago that have been excavated from several burial caves over the last decade as well as the an abundance of archaeological linguistic and historical data indicating a general continuity of cultural traits over a period of three millennia
8043888 archaeological data also do not suggest a separate isolated group evolving differently biologically or culturally although there are subtle differences and changes that occur through time
8043889 had bergers team compared their scant dental metric data with those of other regions in the pacific or elsewhere in the world they would have seen that large teeth are not uncommon in early peoples of these regions
8043890 he did not take the time to understand the area in which he was working its entire history not just the skeletal stuff
8043891 any time you work anywhere you have to understand this history you just cant walk in and cowboy it pull some stuff out and draw conclusions in the absence of understanding the bigger picture
8043892 the brains ability to reorganize itself is much greater than previously believed
8043893 in our studies in which a group of sighted study subjects were blindfolded for five days we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight the speed and dynamic nature of the changes we observed suggest that rather than establishing new nerve connections which would take a long time the visual cortex is unveiling abilities that are normally concealed when sight is intact
8043894 in a sense by masking the eyes we unmask the brains compensatory potential
8043895 half of the study participants remained completely blindfolded 24 hours a day for a total of five days under the careful watch of the staff of bidmcs general clinical research center the other half were only blindfolded for testing but spent the rest of the day seeing normally during their stays both sets of study participants underwent intensive braille instruction for four to six hours a day from a professional instructor from the carroll center for the blind
8043896 this extremely rapid adaptation indicates that functions that are normally inhibited in the brains visual cortex will come to the surface when they are needed
8043897 we believe that over time if these adaptive functions are sustained and reinforced they will eventually lead to permanent structural changes
8043898 our brain captures different types of information from the world sounds sights smells or tactile sensations
8043899 the impressions we form require us to merge these various different elements but sciences traditional view of brain function is that it is organized in separate and highly specialized systems
8043900 our study shows that these views are incorrect and illustrate the potential for the human brain to rapidly and dynamically reorganize itself
8043901 we have shown that even in an adult the normally developed visual system quickly becomes engaged to process touch in response to complete loss of sight and we believe that these principles may also apply to other sensory loss such as deafness or loss of function following brain injury

8043909 penumbra requiem is an expansion to penumbra black plague and is to be considered an epilogue to that game and not as a new episode in the penumbra franchise the main goal with penumbra requiem has been to focus more on the physics puzzles and see how far the current engine could be taken this has made requiem into a game that focuses more on gameplay and puzzles than the previous penumbra instalments and a game that is more experimental in nature although having a strong emphasis on puzzles the game still features a dense atmosphere a trade mark of the penumbra series in overture the goal was to induce strong fears from isolation in black plague a main theme was paranoia and requiem does it best to deliver a nightmarish and feverish atmosphere penumbra requiem is an attempt to deliver a fresh and rewarding experience and not just some rehash of previous material

8043918 todays decision the culmination of a long effort aimed at splitting these two regions away from georgia represents a major step forward in that process
8043919 the u s should lead within the u n and other international forums to cast a clear and unrelenting light on the decision and to further isolate russia internationally because of its actions

8043966 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8043967 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that

8043974 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8043975 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8043976 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

8043980 we strongly support the process of thoroughly investigating allegations of sexual misconduct towards children
8043981 during our inquiries we have obtained comprehensive statements from a number of people who have assisted with the investigation
8043982 i can understand it would be very difficult to come forward and discuss such matters but i would reassure anyone with information that a phone call to police would be dealt with in the strictest confidence

8043991 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
8043992 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
8043993 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
8043994 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
8043995 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
8043996 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
8043997 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
8043998 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
8043999 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country

8044002 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
8044003 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
8044004 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
8044005 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
8044006 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

8044021 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8044022 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8044023 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8044024 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8044025 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

8044027 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8044028 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8044029 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8044030 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8044031 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8044032 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8044033 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8044034 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8044035 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8044036 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8044037 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8044038 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8044039 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8044040 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8044041 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8044042 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

8044073 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8044074 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8044075 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8044076 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8044077 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8044078 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8044079 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8044080 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8044081 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8044082 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

8044098 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8044099 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8044100 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8044101 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8044102 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8044103 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8044104 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8044105 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8044106 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8044107 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

8044109 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

8044127 weve always run great city programs but since the park redevelopment weve seen a boost in community turnout with this new facility we were able to add a master swim program more aquatic exercise classes and even host birthday parties
8044128 right now we are in the middle of an entire modernization program and gap really sets the tone for this movement the strength of the aquatics park is that it gives everyone from one year old to 90 years old the opportunity to use this facility
8044129 this facility brings a huge draw to the area weve had people come from as far as chico bringing in all these visitors provides us an opportunity to support our economic development which is so important right now
8044130 we worked collaboratively and imaginatively to create a sustainable well designed user friendly aquatic center and park space for this community
8044131 i am delighted to be continuing our program of growth as we roll out even more low fares across australia with the addition of another weekly flight between alice springs and melbourne we have experienced a fantastic response to our consistently low fares from tourists and the people of central australia alike and i am delighted that these additional low priced seats will be available in time for the christmas peak season
8044132 i know that there are a lot of people in alice springs who have supported tiger airways in our efforts to break the qantas monopoly and finally bring affordable fares to the people of central australia this additional weekly service is a vote of confidence by us in the community of central australia and we look forward to a strong response in bookings as customers snap up our low low fares we are committed to continuing to grow our presence in alice springs based on consumer demand and hope that these additional services will also encourage a reduction in airport charges and fees at alice springs airport
8044133 the passion that the people of the sunshine coast have displayed in embracing australias true low fare airline has resulted in tiger airways expanding its operation to a daily service between melbourne and the sunshine coast now you can get low low fares every day of the week with tiger airways providing over 130 000 seats per year between melbourne and the sunshine coast
8044134 if you want to travel between perth and melbourne the choice is simple tiger airways not only has the lowest fares but also more flights than any other low fare airline from melbourne tullamarine

8044143 the bus driver actually took her on his route and did not go by our house which he should have took her on a complete route ended up with her on the bus and instead of taking her back to school got with another bus driver but her on another bus that was going to the salvation army after school program
8044144 she told our staff that she didnt know why she was here we assumed it was her first day
8044145 at five years old she was pretty scared i mean give me a break youre talking between 4 and 5 30 were not talking 8 oclock at night were not talking ten oclock at night this is during business working hours they should have had a system set up where they can get a hold of people

8044185 in conclusion we feel that the evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of stay
8044186 the potential benefits to individual patients in health economics terms are such that a well designed large scale blinded randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm is warranted to answer the question of whether gum chewing can significantly reduce the length of stay after abdominal surgery or whether it merely represents a placebo effect

8044260 most people consume as much as 25 percent of their total caloric intake from snacks

8044268 the united states will not take north korea off the state sponsors of terrorism list until we have a protocol in place to verify the dismantling and accounting for koreas nuclear programme
8044269 im not aware of any degradation of our cooperation with respect to the six party talks
8044270 it is not in russias interest to have a nuclear armed nation on its border
8044271 as the us side failed to keep its own side of the agreement we cannot but take the following measures under the principle of action for action
8044272 first weve decided to stop the denuclearisation process that has been under way in accordance with the 3 october agreement this measure already took effect on 14 august and relevant parties have already been informed
8044273 second we will consider restoring the yongbyon facilities to their original state in accordance with strong demands from our relevant agencies
8044274 protesters went outside of their permit zone now the is going to spend millions of dollars to punish them
8044275 the failure of the american media is again evident in the coverage of the georgian russian conflict the us media presented the conflict as a russian invasion of georgia whereas in actual fact the american and israeli trained and equipped georgian military launched a sneak attack to kill and to drive the russian population out of south ossetia a separatist province
8044276 russian peacekeepers together with georgian ones had been stationed in south ossetia since the early 1990s
8044277 this action by saakashvili elected with money from the neoconservative national endowment for democracy an election rigging tool of us hegemony was a war crime in truth the russians should have hung saakashvili as he is far more guilty than was saddam hussein but it is russia not saakashvili that the us media has demonized

8044282 we knew there were issues with stefan going back to last spring weve talked through it with him and we havent had any success
8044283 considered to be one of the top prospects in all of hockey and a well known player in canada because of his high energy agitating play and his off ice humor
8044284 look hes a kid with an enormous amount of talent and skill well a lot of other people have the skill to be a great doctor and yet they decide they dont want to be a doctor anymore hes a 19 year old who maybe has to grow up a little bit yet its not a health issue not as far as i know he wont be attending training camp hes taking time to think things over in my opinion stefan just wants to take a break hes tired from all the things hes gone through the last two seasons all the tournaments the games the shoulder injury all that stuff he feels like he needs some time and space
8044285 when does training camp start sept 19 or 20 until sept 20 he hasnt quit anything
8044286 absolutely yes i think were dealing with a case of burnout here you cant be filled with that much passion for the sport of hockey and decide right like that that youre done with it i think hes going to play again in fact i think when the frost hits the ground hes going to get the itch
8044287 i cant say hes in the process of reconsidering no hes not in the process of anything right now to be honest with you
8044288 i can tell them that we bought the team to have it here in columbus were dedicated to keeping it in columbus but i cant offer guarantees i am reasonably comfortable that well be here for a long time certainly every fiber of what we try to do is to fulfill that original thought my father worked on various sports commissions for probably 35 years to get a pro team for this town it was one of his dreams now sometimes in life you have to do what you have to do but i would consider it a personal defeat if we ended up in that situation

8044297 i was drooling just listening to her talk about the ingredients she will be serving
8044298 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8044299 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8044300 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8044301 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8044302 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8044303 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8044304 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about

8044307 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr
8044308 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8044309 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8044310 we are pleased that we were able to reach this agreement
8044311 following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8044312 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now by doing things the way we did it
8044313 but when you look at the technology we now have and the new ballparks and even some of the old ballparks that have been reconfigured theres no question that it was a challenge to the umpires like anything else in life there are times when you need to make an adjustment
8044314 ever since i was in fifth grade i have pursued a scientific interest
8044315 in our school districts program horizons i was able to explore the study of sleep and dreams for the first time when i joined the suny science research program i knew that i wanted to explore sleep i wanted to know the function of sleep and dreams and in investigating this i found a fascinating area of research the molecular basis of memory
8044316 human computer interaction is a field of study in which the impact of computers on our lives is researched and the usability of artificial entities is explored as we progress through the technological age and computers comprise a larger portion of our lives it is important to understand how humans perceive these machines and how they have an effect on the way in which we live
8044317 in their everyday lives people must differentiate between agents and non agent objects recognizing who will respond to communication or move independently
8044318 my research will focus on determining which characteristics are used to identify agents as agents and to discover to what extent and at which age infants develop the ability to use specific characteristics for identification
8044319 this is a program for students who are very serious about science
8044320 you have to be interested in pursuing a career in the scientific domain
8044321 they learn the vocabulary data analysis to read and write in the scientific language
8044322 the idea is to get to know a number of people in the field that they have chosen and then find a lab in order to do the research work
8044323 the multiple options offer students the opportunity on a time and cost effective basis to acquire skills and credentials in several teaching specialization areas this increases their employment potential in schools that need teachers to fill multiple and flexible roles

8044346 the unprecedented demand for american eagle gold one ounce bullion coins necessitates our allocating these coins among the authorized purchasers on a weekly basis until we are able to meet demand
8044347 there is a tremendous concern over the banking sector and a scramble right now for capital
8044348 a little more and you might have had statistical significance
8044349 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8044350 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8044351 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8044352 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8044353 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8044354 presidents like to take credit when things go well and therefore they should get the blame when things dont go well but there are lots of things driving this not all of which are home grown
8044355 the oil shocks are not and globalization which on balance is good for the country leaves winners and losers
8044356 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8044357 im fairly encouraged by what they managed to do domestically but they cant get out of the cloud of their capital markets businesses
8044358 unfortunately bmo couldnt escape the writedown story again this quarter
8044359 we were modelling increased credit provisioning but it was even higher than we expected
8044360 thats not necessarily a bad thing id rather see a bank keep up with its credit deterioration by provisioning at higher levels than stick its head in the sand and not keep its allowance growing
8044361 this is a significant step for me to get back out on the practice field
8044362 if things go well as we expect they will then i hope to be full go next week and ready for the season opener
8044363 were going to monitor him and rookie tight end tom santi who will start practicing today
8044364 so we do have a pitch count on those guys
8044365 i think its somewhat irrelevant because of where we are today and i kind of like to keep you guys guessing
8044366 i never really like talking too much about an injury because if you play well they say man look how tough he is
8044367 i hope to be ready and i certainly dont want to create this dramatic announcement i think i will do some parts of practice today and tomorrow and i may even dress for thursdays game though i wont play well do a short practice monday and then hopefully ill be full go wednesday
8044368 hes been doing it forever hes been doing it since he was 6 years old in his backyard
8044369 he and marvin harrison have been together forever and this is my eighth year so you kind of get used to it
8044370 we really dont know at this point where it is
8044371 it could be anywhere from a couple of weeks to a major injury we dont know that yet jeff has some options but we dont know how bad it is and it could be through this weekend before we know for sure
8044372 ive always been confident hell be ready for the opener
8044373 well start to see how that goes one thing is we dont want to put him out there if hes not physically or mentally ready
8044374 het is geweldig om minder beroemd te zijn ik denk dat het komt door mijn kortstondige ontmoeting met russell crowe ik heb nog nooit zoveel slechte publiciteit gehad als toen maar dat was op een rare manier fantastisch het deed me realiseren dat de wereld niet om mij draait

8044380 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8044381 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8044382 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
8044383 the capability and their opportunity and what they had for their weaponry i dont see that they would have been able to carry it out

8044403 tenho minhas d vidas se quem fez aquilo foi a torcida do palmeiras no domingo a torcida esteve do nosso lado nos apoiou o tempo todo
8044404 e tamb m n o vi motivo para aquela revolta o palmeiras estava em uma boa condi o na tabela era o quarto colocado com perspectivas de chegar vice lideran a que foi o que aconteceu

8044407 its like you know having dinner with three people for seven years and getting quite bored of each other
8044408 so its having a fourth person new opinion i think its gonna be interesting
8044409 kara has a good reputation of a having hits and b having an opinion and thats a good combination
8044410 concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
8044411 i know kara and she speaks her mind so she will be speaking her mind
8044412 i wore pajamas the girls wore negligees and we kind of broke the ice
8044413 madonna seems to be an extraordinarily brilliant business woman in the business of culture
8044414 shes controlled her controversy so every time shes been in controversy it does her good not bad
8044415 outrageous to invoke nazi imagery in the context of john mccains candidacy
8044416 the whole notion of a democratic republic is that this wasnt just about politicians that anyone could shoot their mouth off about whatever they wanted to
8044417 were in a sad situation if were turning to entertainers for political wisdom
8044418 a blessing hard won by those who came before me
8044419 on the local news at night in cities all over the country
8044420 theyve had a son who has been shot in a drive by shooting
8044421 ohmigod its like sooo obvious he can deny it but its all over school
8044422 jumping in the 20 nationwide car this year was a big step for me in the beginning of the season
8044423 you can jump with a great team have a little bit more pressure and run up front or you can run a middle to the back team not have the pressure to run up front but youre not going to win races
8044424 you could see right then that he was just very very consistent hitting his marks and running the same lap times with the car that he had
8044425 i think the biggest thing is that hes very open minded hes not afraid to move around hell take what he has and do the best with it
8044426 from what weve done so far its been a lot of fun and its been energizing to start over and have to start thinking differently and having to react differently
8044427 overall i think hes done a phenomenal job in everything weve asked him to do so far
8044428 im not concerned about his age at all the proof will be in his ability to drive to run hard and to win
8044429 it could be a quarter midget legend car race whatever it is ok
8044430 the kid can take it he can do the job it is not like he is trying to do more the hype is only there because he has done it he can do it and he has done it that is the only reason the hype is there it will not break him the hype wont break him the kid can do it
8044431 moving up to this car now its more pressure but i can handle it i think its cool when tony stewart left and they brought my name up it was really exciting for me especially as an 18 year old kid
8044432 its cool even to have your name brought up but then for it all to happen and if we all work good then its going to be really exciting
8044433 we went into it open minded we asked him what do you think about the 20 car do you want a veteran guy to serve time with you you could race two thirds of the races and we would bring you up slow or we could wait a year and you could run a season in the nationwide series
8044434 then his dad said let joey talk he did he stood straight up and said heres what i think my experience is im not afraid of these cars ive been in em i understand the big cars he wasnt cocky he just thought if someone else was running the races it would take away from the laps he had he felt the best experience for him was to get in and drive the race cars rather than sitting on the sidelines
8044435 the good thing about joey is that the mother and the daddy have been there the whole time
8044436 thats 18 years of being at the house with him
8044437 the advantage we have with joey is his parents looked after him for 18 years and hes very experienced for his age hes been in tons of cars raced lots of places hes been at big cup practices dealing with the best people in the world and next week at richmond will be another building page in his book
8044438 estou aqui para ajudar tomara que possa jogar mais do que na temporada passada quero demonstrar do que sou capaz como fiz nos jogos ol mpicos
8044439 acho que a sul americana deveria valer uma vaga por exemplo para a libertadores a situa o de alguns clubes n o est boa a vem a sul americana no meio e atrapalha
8044440 eu acho que essa sul americana devia valer vaga para a libertadores agora n s vamos usar para lan ar os jogadores jovens para ver como eles se portam para ver quem quem essa a filosofia do clube
8044441 importante dar confian a a eles n o d para pegar entrosamento mas pelo menos um padr o t tico n o deve haver cobran a porque eles n o est o jogando para isso e sim para apresentar seu futuro e nem press o porque eles t m que jogar vontade

8044445 ele teve uma paci ncia tremenda comigo a paci ncia de depois que eu estreei contra o gr mio e fui expulso sentar comigo e conversar e depois me colocar de novo aos poucos na minha carreira ele fez tudo no momento certo e espero um dia voltar a trabalhar com ele

8044449 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
8044450 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
8044451 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
8044452 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
8044453 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
8044454 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
8044455 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
8044456 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
8044457 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
8044458 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images

8044460 this is the last thing on earth i ever wanted when you start seeing previous councillors voting in blocks it certainly leaves an avenue of a lot of discontent on council
8044461 ever since this council was formed ive been striving to pull it all together and try and make everybody recognise that were there now representing the whole region and not just our own old individual councils
8044462 this new budget of the amalgamated council gave us the ideal opportunity to bring everybody onto a level playing field and to make this truly one region but we didnt do that
8044463 now unfortunately with rate capping while good in theory i believe it leaves a lot to be desired
8044464 people are protected from huge fluctuations and valuations by a 10 per cent rate cap and that means that no matter how far valuations have gone up on individual properties nobody will pay more than 10 per cent more in rates
8044465 we will expand to francistown in the next few months and later stretch to other urban areas

8044471 alberta s economy continues to do well despite a general slowdown in global economic activity
8044472 i think it s clear that alberta is still leading the nation
8044473 but i don t think anyone can remember a time when we ve had such wild and wide fluctuations in energy prices
8044474 we should be having 13 billion in savings this year not 2 5 billion in maybe savings
8044475 we may have a savings opportunity here that we may not have five years from now
8044476 when we look forward in the future and say i want to stay this prosperous forever i think the chances of that are pretty slim
8044477 what would happen if the tribune co took all the money wasted on redesigning its media properties and put it towards covering local news
8044478 a body solar sail concept for the deflection of 99942 apophis
8044479 they are making life and death decisions and they are under extreme personal stress as a consequence
8044480 we have no rush of medical staff leaving our hopsital system
8044481 the best hosting service ive ever worked with bar none
8044482 this is possible under the local government act where a local government can establish a community board to advise local government about matters relating particularly to local communities
8044483 i believe that would be a positive move to help build bridges and better communication between the council and the community
8044484 i think theyve certainly heard it and wed expect them to take action from that
8044485 they certainly knew what the feeling was of the local community and they have to act on that and they might go right through and join with us in future de amalgamation
8044486 in relation to de amalgamation and what would happen to a group like that thats not something that i can be involved in because ive been elected to try and make this regional council work and thats what ill be doing as long as this council operates
8044487 he knows that he has to hold my hand and he knows that he has to look both ways when he crosses the street knows what the stop signs mean the cars are big and they can hurt you
8044488 i think some people dont respect the fact that we have children
8044489 if youre in a 15 mile speed zone and you zip through it 30 miles an hour youll be given a reckless driving ticket right off the bat
8044490 they leave late they dont take in the consideration of other people on the road
8044491 they forget summer is over and they zoom through a school zone which has been closed for three months and surprise surprise here comes the police
8044492 they should have more patrol for the people they should have a police officer in the area so that people are following the speed limit
8044493 any tasmanian couples who wish to access surrogacy will be able to do all their preliminary work here in tasmania
8044494 theyll still need to go interstate to the states that allow altruistic surrogacy contracts in the short term
8044495 i think it will be wonderful to see the bulk of our athletes there and particularly our gold medal winner scottie brennan
8044496 its wonderful to see weve had the highest level of participants of tasmanians in the olympics this year and that theyve delivered equal to our best ever medal haul
8044497 this is a great win for tenants its a great win for pet owners and its a great win for consumer protection
8044498 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
8044499 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
8044500 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus
8044501 if there is any evidence of this occurring we will follow it up immediately
8044502 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8044503 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8044504 there was no communication an immediate loss of any kind of news and a lack of understanding of whats happening to their loved ones
8044505 im very traumatized because i dont know if they are going to let my husband go and when i will see him
8044506 we have kids without dads and pregnant mothers who got their husbands taken away
8044507 what would happen if the tribune co took all the money wasted on redesigning its media properties and put it towards covering local news
8044508 the israeli team led by prime minister ehud olmert has been negotiating the division of jerusalem despite claims to the contrary but would rather conclude an agreement on paper by the end of the year that would give the palestinians a state in the west bank gaza and some israeli territory leaving conclusions on jerusalem for a later date the informed diplomatic sources told wnd

8044511 this is a schedule that is filled with great challenges but one that we are excited to take on
8044512 to play against the two teams who played for the ncaa title last year will be a wonderful experience and one that will get the players and fans very excited overall our schedule is very competitive and i think the fans will come out and support this team that will play and fun and exciting brand of basketball i hope the fans pack the mullins center all season long
8044513 it means so much for us to play a game in springfield
8044514 the connection with the city and mayor domenic sarno has been tremendous springfield is working to become a world class city and this game is just another step in the revitalization of the city we are very excited to host a game at the massmutual center and look forward to a sellout crowd cheering on the minutemen
8044515 we are incredibly excited to have this full collaboration with marvel to create a completely new world that has never been done before in the marvel universe this will be the first time there will be a full japanese anime style for marvel and the madhouse creative team is fully engaged to bring this to a worldwide audience
8044516 what would happen if the tribune co took all the money wasted on redesigning its media properties and put it towards covering local news
8044517 in medical training youre expected to do your job know how to do the job of the person below you and teach it and learn how to do the job of the person above you
8044518 what would happen if the tribune co took all the money wasted on redesigning its media properties and put it towards covering local news
8044519 the new head of hbo felt it was just too dark and too violent and too controversial which of course is kind of the point
8044520 it was a very faithful adaptation of the first few books nearly word for word they offered me the chance to redevelop it but i refused ive learned my lesson on that front and i wont do it again so im afraid its dead at hbo
8044521 is in the process of getting the rights to turn it into a feature film
8044522 heres a book guaranteed to offend a bunch of people not only because of its profuse profanity and graphic violence but because its the epitome of iconoclasm like a brutal accident you cant watch but you cant turn away the story follows an ex preacher man jesse who has become disgusted with gods abandoning of his responsibilities so jesse starts off into the wilds of texas with his hitman girlfriend and new best friend a vampire to find god so that he can give him a piece of his mind despite its superficial perversity this book contains what may be the most moral character in mainstream comics a cult hit in the making fans of quentin tarantino take note
8044523 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8044524 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8044525 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8044526 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8044527 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8044528 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8044529 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8044530 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8044531 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8044532 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8044533 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8044534 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8044535 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8044536 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8044537 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8044538 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8044539 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8044540 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8044541 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8044542 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8044543 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8044544 we talked to the technicians and he explained what theyre going to be doing
8044545 what would happen if the tribune co took all the money wasted on redesigning its media properties and put it towards covering local news
8044546 con este acto se confirma que caracas tiene candidato unitario para la alcald a mayor

8044551 were approaching a pull the plug kind of decision this is like a last stand for webcasting
8044552 our artists and copyright owners deserve to be fairly compensated for the blood and sweat that forms the core product of these businesses
8044553 soundexchange said it supports the higher royalties for internet radio because musicians deserve a bigger cut of internet radio profits
8044554 soundexchange officials argue that because different media have different profit margins it is appropriate to set different royalty rates
8044555 moreover they complain internet radio stations have done too little to make money from playing their songs
8044556 las versiones que han circulado por all son borradores no son la versi n definitiva que daremos a conocer a toda la poblaci n y sobre todo a los medios para que emita su opini n

8044561 the trial compared berry yield and quality water usage weed control and wine quality from two mulch treatments with the growers standard practice
8044562 in the city you need two incomes but out here its not necessarily the case
8044563 over the next few weeks i will follow up these leads talk to business about existing vacancies and arrange a visit to our real estate schools and other facilities
8044564 as its evolved people are more aware and those coming are more motivated and serious than in previous years
8044565 but lets just say you have two families move thats at least two additional incomes house purchased and extra salaries circulating
8044566 we are rolling out a number of new products and have sufficient cash for the renewal of our software
8044567 only about a quarter of our cash is being flushed out even with this dividend
8044568 we have signed some new contracts and renewed a massive contract so we are definitely going to have growth but maybe not at 30
8044569 we have accepted to meet this request of the academic staff and we are fulfilling it today not only because of the importance of computers to modern age but more importantly due to the fact that the idea fits into the planned computerisation drive of the ict programme which is a major component of the newly introduced roadmap for economic growth of kano state
8044570 as far back as 2003 under the human development policy the government has realised the significance of information and communications technology as a panacea to genuine development due to this the process of designing an appropriate blueprint for the development of information and communications technology was set in motion and by 2005 the state came up with information and communications technology policy and a blueprint and time table for its actualisation i am proud to state that kano state is the first in this country to come up with an ict state policy as you might be aware plans have reached an advanced stage in the implementation of the policy many consultations with experts on the subject and professional bodies have been made and the ict park will be located at gidan ado bayero at kofar nassarawa funds have been allocated for the project
8044571 we have created several boards like the teachers service board the science and technical schools board and have even created the ministry of higher education in order to ensure that the sector is revamped and raised to a higher level due to its significance in our quest for development that is why the roadmap has given significant attention to it and that is why we have increased funding of the sector
8044572 it will serve as an alternative revenue base to oil and as a means through which the problems of unemployment could be addressed this is in addition to the other benefits that will accrue to the state in areas related to software design and production for local and international markets
8044573 this shift to the use of computers will not only revolutionise teaching and learning but it will expand the frontiers of research as limitless knowledge will be at the disposal of teachers and the students
8044574 trabalhamos para isso nos treinos a gente procura sempre corrigir o posicionamento e a parte t tica da equipe eram fatores onde o time n o estava correspondendo eu n o sou muito adepto de coletivo gosto de posicionar o time
8044575 at hoje desde que eu assumi n o fiz nenhum coletivo porque eu acho que o santos no momento precisa mais de um posicionamento do que um coletivo
8044576 estou pronto conhe o bem o grupo do flamengo e acho que n o vou ter problemas agora trabalhar bastante para estar disposi o do caio j nior minhas caracter sticas s o de armar as jogadas para os atacantes
8044577 espero que no flamengo eu possa manter a boa m dia de gols que eu tive nos ltimos clubes vou lutar muito para conquistar o meu espa o aqui um sonho e uma grande oportunidade estou chegando com muita vontade e a ansiedade grande espero fazer um bom papel
8044578 tem a experi ncia do meu irm o luis o que um dos lideres do benfica para me ajudar na europa s o contratos longos e eu quero ir pra ficar e fazer hist ria espero que isso aconte a no hamburgo
8044579 this is really not a safety issue this is an aggravation issue
8044580 it happens its just weird because youre sitting and you dont know if its going to be 20 minutes or 2 hours
8044581 theyre releasing the planes but on a one by one basis so its really backed the whole system up at least in the atlanta area
8044582 i dont really want to spend the rest of the evening in the airport im hoping they get this fixed
8044583 were just coming back from europe were really tired and this is bad news
8044584 i was just joking with the crowd and said hey we got a ticket on the way in
8044585 the way i do it when people ask me to fix their tickets is i say ill pay for it and thats it
8044586 i still love politics im quite excited to be here
8044587 i thank you for giving me one more excuse to show up at my partys convention
8044588 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
8044589 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
8044590 suppose for example youre a voter and you have candidate x and you have candidate y
8044591 candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that person can deliver on anything candidate y disagrees with you on half the issues but you believe that on the other half the candidate will be able to deliver
8044592 this is the kind of question that i predict and this has nothing to do with whats going on now but i am just saying if you look at 5 10 15 years from now you may actually see this delivery issue become a serious issue in democratic debates because it is so hard to figure out how to turn good intentions into real changes in the lives of the people we represent
8044593 i think thats going to come back to bite the party
8044594 he used every ounce he had to get through the seven minutes
8044595 i dont think there was an attempt to slight the clintons
8044596 there may be some hard feelings but i think people look back on his administration as a period of peace and economic prosperity
8044597 bill clintons place in the hearts of democrats is very secure he rescued us from the wilderness
8044598 we had been wandering there for 40 years having lost three presidential elections
8044599 now were turning a page barack obama is going to be our next president and i expect bill clinton to be campaigning for him
8044600 he will assert that role in any number of ways well see one of those ways when he gives a speech at the convention
8044601 if anything i wouldnt be at all surprised to see clinton give a very strong speech in support of obama
8044602 a gente quer um jogador mais experiente um atacante que possa chegar e praticamente ocupar a posi o de titular claro que isso depende da escala o do treinador
8044603 podemos contratar um atleta e ele chegar aqui e o t cnico achar que n o vai utiliz lo no esquema mas a inten o dos dirigentes e com o respaldo do ad lson a contrata o de um atacante de ponta
8044604 n o faz nenhum sentido a gente ficar contratando jogadores que seriam uma expectativa uma esperan a
8044605 o clube est negociando com dois atacantes que est o no exterior pode ter novidade em breve pode vir um ou os dois
8044606 god willing and with the goodwill of the parties and the tireless work of the parties we have a good chance to succeed
8044607 the settlement activity is not conducive to creating an environment for negotiations
8044608 anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
8044609 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8044610 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8044611 we are pleased that we were able to reach this agreement
8044612 following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8044613 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now by doing things the way we did it
8044614 but when you look at the technology we now have and the new ballparks and even some of the old ballparks that have been reconfigured theres no question that it was a challenge to the umpires like anything else in life there are times when you need to make an adjustment
8044615 adrian looked at these people tortured but unbowed peaceful and meek and he put them under oath to say what they hoped for from their god that they should undergo such tortures

8044690 cruelty to animals has a long history in china rich people in ancient times used to put live ducks onto hot iron plates and the ducks end up dancing themselves to death the diners then eat the meat on the ducks feet because it was said to be much more delicious than the meat of ducks cooked in the ordinary way said media china has many cruelly prepared dishes one is called the three squeaks this dish consists of live baby mice and its name comes from the fact they squeak first when picked up by the diners chopsticks second when dipped in sauce and third when placed in the mouth and bitten media also noted that while some people were kinder to animals this could stem from a fear of being punished if animals are treated badly because buddhism encourages people not to eat animals since after death people may become animals themselves it is fear of religious retribution that may dictate positive treatment of animals rather than the natural expression of kindness itself

8044692 china does have laws to protect its endangered species though like so many laws in the country they carry little judiciary weight the result of which leaves rare animals hunted for food in an age of grocery stores and supermarkets a nationwide campaign called spring thunder in 2003 saw chinese police inspect nearly 16 000 animal fairs and 67 800 hotels and restaurants across the county during the inspection which lasted just nine days 838 500 endangered animals were confiscated saved from chinas kitchens about 45 000 of them were wildlife with first class state protection in 2007 demand for wild and exotic animals on the dinner table was still high thirteen people were sentenced to up to 14 years in prison after they were found guilty of illegally buying and selling thousands of state protected wild animals in the largest wild animal trade case the country had seen said media one man ma weihu illegally bought about 900 owls a grade ii state protected animal to sell to restaurants in southern guangdong province while chinas laws on endangered species are clearly ineffectual the country also does not have a single law ruling against animal cruelty none animal abuse cannot be tackled with public opinion or moral pressure its time for legislation said mang ping assistant professor with the central socialist academy and a long time advocate for animal rights in china

8044726 this is good news and is entirely attributable to the availability of government programs like medicaid and the state childrens health insurance program schip
8044727 programs like schip and medicaid are lifelines for providing americans with the healthcare they need especially during times when the economy is soft and more people feel vulnerable to losing employer sponsored health insurance
8044728 while this decline is a temporary victory for kids we fear next years data will paint a worse picture for americas children than ever before as the effects of a sluggish economy will be coupled with the inability of congress to pass renewal of the state childrens health insurance program over president bushs two vetoes
8044729 an opportunity for the private sector and the government to work together
8044730 so a lot of businesses across the country are feeling they can not sustain the healthcare coverage they used to provide for their workers or they are requiring workers to pay more in premiums and deductibles and as a result many of the workers can no longer afford coverage
8044731 and more and more people are priced out of the healthcare they used to take for granted
8044732 its very much in line with the original strategy to fold much of the legacy hp services capability into the eds management framework

8044740 the slot auctions are necessary to ensure that all airlines have an opportunity to compete in the new york markets now that the number of flights at each of the three major regional airports has been capped
8044741 the auctions will preserve competitive airline service help lower fares for service to and from the region and give new carriers an opportunity to enter the market
8044742 would result in higher costs for airlines increased ticket prices for airline passengers and fewer flights to small communities

8044746 is an act sin because it is not in the character of god or is it not in the character of god
8044747 platos euthyphro raised an issue which in various forms was often debated in christian and mohammedan scholasticism namely do the gods love the good because it is good or is it good because the gods love it such a problem could only arise when the gods and the good were regarded as two different entities and where it was take for granted that the gods do not always act according to the highest standards of goodness and justice to inquire about this would be just as meaningless as to inquire is a particular point within the circle called the center due to its equidistance from the periphery or is its equidistance from the periphery due to its being the center the dichotomy of the holy and the good is alien to the spirit of the great prophets to their thinking the righteousness of god is inseparable from his being

8044776 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
8044777 military operations lasted several hours during which airstrikes were called in the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others local residents were able to confirm the number of casualties including names age and gender of the victims
8044778 the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8044779 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8044780 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8044781 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8044782 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8044783 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8044784 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8044785 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8044786 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8044787 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8044788 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8044789 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8044790 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8044791 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8044792 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8044793 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8044794 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8044795 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8044796 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8044797 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8044798 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8044799 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8044800 listen honestly i cant talk to anyone right now and im very nervous about whats going on in here with the lollipop and everything ollies temper tantrum
8044801 of course they are still proud of you and you have to do the best move for yourself
8044802 why would they say that to me why would they tell me
8044803 jerry said you have to look at using lies as ploys in the game week 1
8044804 i hope they do not portray him jerry as innocent and always standing by his word nobody knows what weve had to deal with from him so annoying
8044805 we might as well stay in here where weve got eachother instead of going out and being abused by them
8044806 im not scared im just lazy for the sake of being lazy today
8044807 i hope we have a luxury comp so i can leave with something besides the unitard

8044811 if him or ollie win itll be like s6 were some girl maggie won nobody liked her
8044812 heres the good news if one of them does win then the following week itll be 3 on 1
8044813 they want to give jerry a chance its fair for everyone lets put it that way

8044827 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8044828 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8044829 the court will deny the executives request for a stay
8044830 hence the executive should respond to the document aspect of the subpoenas by producing non privileged material and identifying more specifically the materials it is withholding on a claim of executive privilege
8044831 it is on ms mierss appearance that the dispute principally focuses this decision should not however foreclose the parties continuing attempts to reach a negotiated solution both sides indicated that discussions regarding an accommodation have resumed
8044832 has failed to demonstrate that it has a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of the absolute immunity issue or that it has even raised a question
8044833 the executives argument boils down to a claim that a stay is appropriate because the underlying issue is important
8044834 but that is beside the point and does not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits simply calling an issue important primarily because it involves the relationship of the political branches does not transform the executives weak arguments into a likelihood of success or a substantial appellate issue hence the court concludes that this prong of the stay pending appeal analysis cuts strongly in favor of the committee
8044835 toward that end and hopefully as a prelude to meaningful discussions between us i propose that members of our respective staffs meet as early as next week to re commence discussing possibilities for reaching an accommodation between the branches in this matter
8044836 as i know you appreciate this litigation is very important in determining constitutional contours governing certain relations between the executive and legislative branches in the congressional oversight setting
8044837 accordingly the department of justice has now filed an appeal in this matter and is also seeking a stay of the decision pending review by the u s court of appeals for the d c circuit
8044838 that course of action will provide appellate consideration of the novel questions at stake in this matter and will enable the parties to obtain if it should prove necessary a final decision in this important matter however the fact that the executive has notice an appeal in this matter does not signify that we think further litigation is the exclusive path forward
8044839 represents the best hope of promoting an accommodation between the two branches
8044840 had the litigants indicated that a negotiated solution was foreseeable in the near future the court may have stayed its hand in the hope that further intervention in this dispute by the article iii branch would not be necessary
8044841 as it stands however the court must decide the questions presented to it but there is still ample time for the parties to reach an accommodation the courts july 31 2008 order does not compel ms miers to appear at any particular date
8044842 todays ruling clearly rejects the white houses efforts to run out the clock on the committees investigation of doj politicization this congress
8044843 i am heartened that judge bates recognized that the public interest in this matter is best served by the furtherance of the committees investigation the committee intends to promptly schedule a hearing with ms miers and stands ready as always to consider any reasonable offer of accommodation with the white house
8044844 the executive cannot identify a single judicial opinion that recognizes absolute immunity for senior presidential advisors in this or any other context
8044845 in fact there is supreme court authority that is all but conclusive on this question and that powerfully suggests that such advisors do not enjoy absolute immunity the court therefore rejects the executives claim of absolute immunity for senior presidential aides
8044846 the aspect of this lawsuit that is unprecedented is the notion that ms miers is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process the supreme court has reserved absolute immunity for very narrow circumstances involving the presidents personal exposure to suits for money damages based on his official conduct or concerning matters of national security or foreign affairs the executives current claim of absolute immunity from compelled congressional process for senior presidential aides is without any support in the case law
8044847 a limited number of u s attorneys could be targeted for removal and replacement
8044848 why would i do that i know my business and its challenges better than anyone else
8044849 there were some truly inspired performances like the wacky ruth gamble who steals every scene shes in or dave hill who plays token male the sole guy in the show who takes on all the male role in the refugees stories yet manages with incredible precision to milk every laugh out of his many small cameos
8044850 i was also impressed by lauren van kurin who portrays a veritable menagerie of incidental adult characters with the manic ferocity of a female jack black and dave hill who as the
8044851 lets get in gear with one awesome cheer its time to enjoy masons 3rd monster truck birthday bash and youre invited
8044852 at half time we told the lads to pass the ball a lot quicker
8044853 we werent quite on top of our game but the players stepped up a gear or two in the second period and the result was a scintillating display
8044854 ledesma will get all the plaudits for his hat trick but im just as pleased with the defensive display
8044855 thats two clean sheets on the bounce now and were progressing very nicely in all areas of the pitch
8044856 we took a lot of confidence from scoring early in the second half we were in our rhythm then and the lads looked first class
8044857 the decision apparently was the result of a kick off among feely connor barth and nick novak feely made 24 of 30 over two days barth made 28 of 30 and novak made 27 of 30
8044858 i almost threw in the towel when i heard that we would have points deducted for not wearing blindfolds
8044859 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8044860 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8044861 i have gone back and forth on this because as a player youll always want to play youll never lose that urge to be out there
8044862 i really love my life now its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8044863 this was a bad knee jerk decision based on need this year with no thought for the future
8044864 maliciously assault beat strike and batter plaintiff her face and head with great force and violence causing severe and permanent disfigurement to her face
8044865 it would be safe to say im leaning towards that
8044866 hed love to be able to get tons of work and have all the otas and all that stuff
8044867 its just not where we are right now the most important thing to me is us getting ready as a group and getting ready for miami i think the more work that he does with our guys in the group the better i really look at the last preseason game as being able to evaluate individuals as opposed to the team and its really important from that perspective
8044868 soybeans have been challenging to label over the past week and ive spent a lot of time going back between looking at the combined session charts and the pit session charts i do so to get a good feel of clarity and substructure of a market
8044869 so what i think is going on now with soybeans is that we have an initial move for wave a secondary for wave and that subsequent price action is tracing out a diagonal triangle
8044870 diagonal triangles are very exciting wave patterns they often lead to swift and sizable swings in price so ill be watching this market very carefully
8044871 beginning to have serious repercussions on public health and young peoples life prospects
8044872 it will continue to do so for future generations unless something is done to tackle the problem
8044873 this is what you need to do and how you need to do it
8044874 if you are a law abiding type of participant you may begin at the library and proceed through the playground and the caf to the torture chamber are a wild and impulsive participant you may hop skip and jump your way among the modules and sections you may go to the playground first get trounced find out what types of questions are asked and then work your way through the library feel lucky or have an inflated sense of self esteem you may skip all of the studying go directly to the torture chamber and complete the assignment are a grasshopper you may skim through the library jump to the caf enjoy the games in the playground and then return to the library for some serious studying
8044875 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
8044876 well that is our job we dont technically get money for the hours we put in but it is our job
8044877 so um the webpage or whatever is just something you do for fun do you have a real job
8044878 well that is our job we dont technically get money for
8044879 given that caligula is a film of historical interest we felt we could pass it uncut

8045311 the implications of this language are far reaching and orwellian
8045312 for the government and utility company to say were going to control the devices in your house and you have no choice in that matter thats where the line is drawn that sentence must be removed
8045313 i actually was more concerned in the 2001 electricity crisis that folks on critical medical devices like respirators kidney dialysis machines and things like that were going through rolling blackouts
8045314 thats a very challenging thing to face moving somebodys temperature up by a few degrees really seems mild by comparison
8045315 that means someone can turn on the air conditioning before they leave work for home and have the house comfortable when they walk in the door or if they forgot before leaving home for a ski trip they can remotely lower the thermostat at home and save money
8045316 since utilities have old inefficient and dirty power plants on reserve to use during peak demand hours dropping demand will mean less use of these dirty power plants and less pollution
8045317 i hate this state why dont we just fly a communist flag while we are at it we are planning a move out of state im done

8045351 the issue is money and right now not many legislative candidates are talking about big broad programs simply because we all understand that practically speaking theres no money

8045362 we knew the usa were going to be tough up front but in the second half we came over top of them
8045363 the first half we played to our plan and then made the adjustments for the win

8045366 its like the weather you really cant tell whats going to happen but the caffeine idea is not beyond the realm of imagination its a product that just like tobacco can be portrayed as some kind of diabolical thing being used against innocent people by wealthy corporations
8045367 if you said in 1970 or 1980 that people are going to bring enormous lawsuits against tobacco companies accuse them of fooling people into smoking cigarettes and then use that as a pretext to take a lot of money from them to run government programs people would have laughed at you
8045368 they would have said of course people choose as a matter of their own decision making whether or not to smoke nonetheless the lawsuits happened and i think caffeine is a plausible new target

8045381 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
8045382 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
8045383 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus
8045384 if there is any evidence of this occurring we will follow it up immediately

8045399 jennifer didnt see herself and john having much in common or having a future together
8045400 she wasnt fazed by the ending of it she wasnt hurt at all she feels fine
8045401 didnt want to waste anybodys time if somethings not right
8045402 the fact john has spoken out about dumping her has really upset her
8045403 last week he went to a party tipped off the paps and even had decoy cars at the ready when he was leaving

8045409 if the russians have it it needs to be returned immediately
8045410 but theres conflicting reports on it right now wed certainly expect that the russians would return any equipment that is us equipment and return it quickly if in fact they do have it
8045411 theres some also indications that theyve made that assurance if theyve made that assurance they need to honor that commitment as well

8045420 a long term threat and a short term threat to our national security
8045421 for sen bidens iraq hearings to be anything more than a political sham used to invoke a modern day gulf of tonkin resolution equivalent for iraq his committee will need to ask hard questions and demand hard facts concerning the real nature of the weapons threat posed by iraq
8045422 everyone in the world thought he had them the weapons inspectors said he had them
8045423 preordained a conclusion that seeks to remove saddam hussein from power regardless of the facts and using these hearings to provide political cover for a massive military attack on iraq
8045424 as long as saddams at the helm there is no reasonable prospect you or any other inspector is ever going to be able to guarantee that we have rooted out root and branch the entirety of saddams program relative to weapons of mass destruction
8045425 the only way were going to get rid of saddam hussein is were going to end up having to start it alone
8045426 its going to require guys like you in uniform to be back on foot in the desert taking saddam down
8045427 one thing is clear these weapons must be dislodged from saddam or saddam must be dislodged from power
8045428 if we wait for the danger from saddam to become clear it could be too late
8045429 he did not snub the u n or our allies he did not dismiss a new inspection regime he did not ignore the congress at each pivotal moment he has chosen a course of moderation and deliberation
8045430 i do not believe this is a rush to war i believe it is a march to peace and security i believe that failure to overwhelmingly support this resolution is likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur
8045431 we must be clear with the american people that we are committing to iraq for the long haul not just the day after but the decade after

8045463 we know from a century of northern resource exploration that there is gas in the beaufort sea oil in the eastern arctic and gold in the yukon there are diamonds in nunavut and the northwest territories and countless other precious resources buried under the sea ice and tundra
8045464 but what weve found so far is merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg
8045465 the world is getting smaller the pieces of the map are being filled in there will be no where to hide
8045466 these areas are host to some of the worlds most biodiverse coral reefs and habitat and some of the most interesting and compelling geological formations in all of our oceans
8045467 however if the president establishes these new sites as no take reserves where no extractive activity is allowed it would be one of the most significant environmental achievements of any us president
8045468 the president is on the cusp of conserving more territory than any leader has ever done thats an amazing legacy to leave the nation
8045469 it does not therefore depend on mans will or effort but on gods mercy
8045470 the windiest sites have not been built because there is no way to move that electricity from there to the load centers
8045471 if you want to do it on a national scale where the transmission line distances will be much longer and utility regulations are different congress must act
8045472 modernizing the electric infrastructure is an urgent national problem and one we all share
8045473 the key is not to prioritize whats on your schedule but to schedule your priorities
8045474 effective people are not problem minded theyre opportunity minded they feed opportunities and starve problems
8045475 the world has enough women who are tough we need women who are tender there are enough women who are coarse we need women who are kind there are enough women who are rude we need women who are refined we have enough women of fame and fortune we need more women of faith we have enough greed we need more goodness we have enough vanity we need more virtue we have enough popularity we need more purity
8045476 regrettably we have noticed the hand of our enemies to thwart us
8045477 food is the latest weapon in their regime change agenda
8045478 they cannot last a day longer if we as zimbabweans speak against them in deafening unison
8045479 may i observe that some of us have philosophic humanitarian and theological differences with those who put forth abortion as an appropriate routine and acceptable birth control procedure there are millions of us who would hold that such a position conflicts with our conviction regarding our sacred responsibility to our children and to human life itself
8045480 we know that our party will understand and acknowledge the moral and spiritual pain that so many of us feel because of this disregard for the lives of the unborn
8045481 those of us who support the democratic party despite our disagreement on this issue support it because the democratic party articulates and pursues more of the position that are relevant to the lives and circumstances of our people the people of america in general and the people of the world
8045482 others loudly proclaim their advocacy for the unborn but they refuse to recognize their reasonability and the responsibility of our nation to those who have been born among the living they are presently and historically silent if not indifferent to the suffering of our inner cities the extreme levels of social and economic inequality that exists in our country and around the world and to the ethically indefensible restrictions blocking the access of some to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all
8045483 you sir charles blake are no ally of mine this is why i am a proud liberal progressive left winger and not a democrat that these people think they should be heard
8045484 thats some fancy foot work there to keep talking about pregnancy and manage to not utter the words

8045499 if everything in the media were true he would have been dismissed from the team immediately theres a lot more to this story
8045500 posada is not the average immigrant who applies for naturalization
8045501 the us government did warn posada in the presence of posadas lawyer at the beginning of the interview that among other things he could exercise his right against self incrimination if he thought that an answer would incriminate him lying could subject him to criminal penalties and any statement he gave could be used in any legal or administrative proceeding
8045502 posada not the government triggered with his naturalization application a civil adjudicatory process that by regulation calls for both an investigation of the applicant and an interview
8045503 more to the point is the undeniable fact that given his history and notoriety posada was a highly unusual applicant there is simply no reason to expect his naturalization interview to approximate that of a typical applicant
8045504 it was not permissible for the district court under judge kathleen cardone to suppress posadas statements at the interview unless translation errors affected the crucial questions and answers relevant to the false statements charged in the indictment in such a way that these statements as a matter of law may not form the basis for a false statements conviction otherwise the matter of posadas understanding of the questions should have been left to the jury

8045522 wir sollen es uns leisten wir k nnen es uns leisten es w rde der bev lkerung helfen es w rde der kaufkraft helfen

8045528 ich habe die gr nen fr her als starke bewegung in erinnerung heute habe ich diesen eindruck nicht mehr trotzdem glaube ich dass wir gut zusammenarbeiten k nnten
8045529 bei allen stellungnahmen habe ich gesagt ich bin f r zusammenarbeit auch mein 5 punkte programm ist ein aufruf zur zusammenarbeit der politischen kr fte
8045530 ich habe nur gesagt mit wem ich nicht zusammenarbeiten will sonst habe ich niemanden ausgeschlossen ich glaube dass es auch in der vp kr fte gibt mit denen man gut zusammenarbeiten kann
8045531 viele familien haben es schwer die studiengeb hren f r die studenten zu zahlen
8045532 in den 70ern hat man auch gesagt es ist notwendig dass die schulb cher gratis sind die sch lerfreifahrt soll gemacht werden der freie zugang zur bildung soll gew hrleistet sein so wie damals f r die schule soll auch der zugang zur universit t frei sein
8045533 es ist die frage wie geht man mit den umweltherausforderungen um damit auch eine gewisse sozialvertr glichkeit gew hrleistet wird zur sozialvertr glichkeit geh rt dass ich nie der meinung war man soll den benzinpreis so hoch machen dass ihn sich nur mehr ein paar wenige leisten k nnen ich war auch nie der meinung man soll den autobahnausbau stoppen ganz im gegenteil ich bin f r die zweiten tunnelr hren
8045534 ich habe mich 18 monate lang bem ht die bahn auszubauen wir wollen den personen und nahverkehr ausbauen in allen st dten
8045535 wirkliche einsparungen sind bei der energieeffizienz m glich dort war ich 13 jahre als wohnbaustadtrat t tig mit mehr als 120 000 sanierten wohnungen aber das brauchen sie aber nicht ausspielen gegen die ma nahmen die wir im stra enverkehr haben
8045536 gerade im bereich verkehr beim transit l sst sich nachweisen dass in der eu viel zu ver ndern ist
8045537 es gibt viele bereiche wo zu wenig getan wird zum beispiel bei den rechten der arbeitnehmerinnen und arbeitnehmer
8045538 im unterschied zu den gr nen hat die sozialdemokratie viel dazu beigetragen dass wir der eu beigetreten sind auch heute treten wir f r die eu ein f r das gro e friedensprojekt aber wir lassen uns nicht verbieten dass wir f r eine volksabstimmung sind
8045539 und sie der sie aus der hainburg bewegung kommen haben auf einmal ein problem mit einer volksabstimmung ich bin berrascht dass nicht mehr zuspruch von ihnen kommt
8045540 was l uft schief dass so viele menschen kritisch gegen ber der eu sind ein sozialer ausgleich eine sozialere kologischere b rgern herer eu w rde das vertrauen der bev lkerung wieder zur ckgewinnen
8045541 i think prices could fall below us 100 a barrel on slowing global demand and rising production in the us brazil and canada and from opec states such as saudi arabia and angola
8045542 that scenario is now more realistic than any time in the past five years
8045543 i think it would be more valuable to save it for real emergencies
8045544 by small increments over long periods of time doesnt have a lot of impact on price
8045545 sources briefed on the initiative said the initial concept stores are planned for washington d c and sacramento calif and long term plans call for 500 to 1 000 stores with about 100 slated to open in the next year
8045546 brushed steel accents white tiled floors and a wall of sea foam colored hand cut glass tile
8045547 will either be housed in an adjacent store accessible to cvs shoppers via a breezeway or a separate store within a cvs store
8045548 hot babes of insert any event location era whatever etc here
8045549 almost all igneous rocks have some small amount of radiation
8045550 still youd probably die from something else other than granite countertops
8045551 for people that have a concern about this have it tested if that gives them peace of mind
8045552 the best thing is test for radon in your home thats the only way you can find out
8045553 hearing about what could be in the air from the countertops made me worry and think is that in our countertop
8045554 the number of granite countertops youre going to find that are actually going to be a radiation hazard are few and far between
8045555 what were seeing on the readings is basically normal background theres very little radiation coming from the granite countertop itself
8045556 it lacks sidewalk and it lacks crossing guards where there are major intersections
8045557 what theyll do is take it all around extend it all the way around here where you see the curb almost to where you see the truck
8045558 i believe it is on the fast track i talked to the project manager myself and he is aware that we are implementing these new procedures beginning on tuesday sept 2 and thats our hope and wish that it is going to be completed before then
8045559 theyre systemic their pervasive and you cant gloss over them and say its an event or the system broke down here
8045560 thats not whats going on we have a lack of training lack of appropriate personnel
8045561 sometimes we have some of our least trained qualified folks at those levels providing direct care services
8045562 and if we need salary provisions and those kinds of things to hire the appropriate people to run these hospitals we need to do it and we need to do it as soon as we can
8045563 i think if we look at his record hes making very serious efforts toward reforming and doing things about this
8045564 going to the nationals would be an amazing experience and its great that we have the opportunity to do that
8045565 when we are recruiting or playing against our competitors or are in the community this will mark us as oh yeah thats salem college athletics
8045566 the cult of obama is no stranger or kitschier than the cult of reagan or the short lived cult of george w bush its true that a lot of obama supporters have unrealistic expectations of what he could accomplish as president but that is not a good reason to vote against him
8045567 vigorous expression of the freedoms that make our society great
8045568 and each generation needs to explore the history of the past to understand fully the context in which these polar extremes come into clashes with one another so history of how we dealt with these problems in the 1940s and 1950s is a current history and a history that is very important for us to understand
8045569 there is absolutely nothing to link hari puttar with harry potter
8045570 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8045571 we have the man we need at last to embrace the future not the past and to dispel eight years of pain and shame barack obama is his name call the roll
8045572 there is not a unity problem if anyone doubts that wait till you see hillary clintons speech
8045573 real sex education voted against affordable family planning and if elected john mccain has vowed to appoint supreme court justices who will overturn roe v wade
8045574 while families are losing sleep tonight trying to figure out some way to make their paycheck stretch through one more day john mccain is sleeping better than ever

8045577 the theme of the skull is the aversion of death in art
8045578 that is also a popular theme in paintings from the dutch golden age
8045579 as an artist i try to make things that people can believe in that they can relate to that they can experience
8045580 you therefore have to show them as well as possible
8045581 it is a very difficult thing to do to stand up in the high court of london and admit to be a liar
8045582 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8045583 but after long deliberation and throwing around a million scenarios in my head for the past day i think its just best if i stay retired
8045584 its great having nobody put a finger on me you really put yourself through an awful lot in this league more than people realize
8045585 we knew it was a long shot but we owed it to ourselves to exhaust the possibility
8045586 we appreciate michael even considering ending his retirement he has a new career in front of him and we wish him nothing but the best as we all said when he announced his retirement michael was and is a great giant
8045587 there is a reason he went in the first round obviously
8045588 the guy he is playing behind strahan and osi and then we moved him to linebacker so obviously he is one of our top players on the team and he is going to show that he is a top defensive end in the league
8045589 we know we are a confident team and we are a playoff capable team and we have to go out and perform like it
8045590 the reason we took the underdog role last year was because everybody said it and we just went with it were not thinking like that this year we do have a chip on our shoulders and it grows more and more when somebody gives us something to feed off of
8045591 the only reason he will come back is if he wants to play
8045592 many sources these days are taking their stories straight to the public because self important journalists by and large ignore or belittle them
8045593 thats whats happened with many whistleblowers who challenge the official version of the wars in iraq and afghanistan with bush apologists dominating television talk shows and newspaper op ed pages dissenters issue books and blogs to get past a virtual news censorship of informed criticism of the war on terrorism
8045594 the open is perfect for me personality wise he said the game hasnt caught up ive been waiting for something to celebrate and the serves arent accurate enough the groundstrokes just arent powerful enough dominating enough
8045595 whatever it is just comes up short today i got a chance to get up there but thats because of who i was playing i just havent come up with the goods to be that person who everyone looks at not just a cultish small sector
8045596 when i was younger i had some chances and as i got older i started becoming more defensive
8045597 corruption could not have chosen ground for its stand with better promise of success
8045598 the whole district is a maze of narrow often unsuspected passageways necessarily for there is scarce a lot that has not two three or four tenements upon it swarming with unwholesome crowds what a view of the bend would be like is a matter of bewildering conjecture
8045599 wrote about everything from deaths accidents crimes fires murders brawls fraud and embezzlement to epidemics of cholera smallpox typhus yellow fever and tuberculosis
8045600 it was my task to cover all the news that means trouble to someone
8045601 made a virtue out of working as little as possible there was tacit agreement among the reporters as to which stories they would cover
8045602 we in denmark discerned no difference between the east and the west coast
8045603 there go and get your breakfast and better give up the war
8045604 faith comes by what is heard and what is heard comes by the preaching of christ
8045605 the bread which we break is it not a participation in the body of christ
8045606 to each is given the manifestation of the spirit for the common good
8045607 as a plan for the fullness fo time to unite all things in him things in heaven and things on earth
8045608 other stations that follow sinclairs lead should expect a similar response from people who dont want the political discourse cheapened with these false negative attacks
8045609 theyre going all of these routes through threats intimation to try to thwart the first amendment here because they dont have an argument on merit
8045610 your station is committed to operating in the public interest an objective that cannot be satisfied by accepting for compensation material of such malicious falsity
8045611 knowing and willful attempt to evade the strictures of federal election law
8045612 i have met and like john mccain but he bombed and presumably killed many people in a war i opposed
8045613 if i can set all that aside i would hope that americans will accept
8045614 dont get me wrong i wanted to do good to do everyone proud to at least look decent on youtube
8045615 with this win america has just entered an air guitar dynasty
8045616 i will not allow republicans to have a hoax on the american people that if you drill offshore the price at the pump will come down
8045617 im going over here to try to make myself a better racecar driver
8045618 i wanted to be more competitive and i wanted to have some more opportunities to win races and things like that
8045619 it seems like this year it has been the worst year out of the three so i guess you could say that probably factored in on things like that
8045620 i felt like ive done everything i can with the situation im in now
8045621 like i said it just seems like this last year it got a little bit worse as far as not being able to find some speed at some of these places
8045622 it seems like they are definitely on an uphill climb towards the top
8045623 they have definitely made progress its a team that i think will be here for a long time and seems to be heading in the right direction to win races
8045624 reed is a highly talented driver with a wealth of experience and accomplishments for a 22 year old
8045625 we believe he has a great future ahead of him here at gillett evernham motorsports he will be a great fit with our drivers sponsors and employees
8045626 i think they believe in me as a driver and that means a lot and i believe in them as a team
8045627 you know any type of breakup like that is not the easiest thing in the world to do for either side
8045628 but i feel like it went fairly well im not too sure how good those types of things can go but i think its ok
8045629 i think everybody kind of tried to pull together and tried to make sure that nobody was pointing fingers or anything like that
8045630 its obviously not a fun process to go through thats for sure having the extra pressure on you
8045631 but at the same time long term wise i feel like this is where i want to be
8045632 more banks will come on the troubled list as credit problems worsen
8045633 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8045634 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8045635 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8045636 the ad must not be broadcast again in its current form
8045637 you amp squo ll never know which part of the internet you amp squo ll need
8045638 in fact wed like to see it go a little bit further
8045639 we want to make sure that the urgent advice that climate change and water minister penny wong and prime minister kevin rudd have received in terms of what can be done right now to assist water in the coorong and the lower lakes we think that should be part of the inquiry
8045640 we expect to present a deal to the mlb major league baseball some time before the end of the year
8045641 i really hope i can stick around for some time
8045642 its stupid rules that somebody made in 1850 and now they give me the problems with these things and it shouldnt be that way
8045643 how can a guy see a foot fault with sunglasses from 35 feet metres away it doesnt make any sense
8045644 the u s government should end mandates for ethanol and let the free market work
8045645 again am not familiar with front page except in the newspaper but it works

8045648 any nonprofit that solicits donations should be willing to say where their moneys coming from
8045649 if we did have to disclose we wouldnt have much to disclose
8045650 traditional mass media is not a growth business and so to continue to resonate and be relevant broadcast stations need to basically embrace digital media including the web youll actually continue to have a healthy viable broadcast business but you have to accept its not growing and its becoming less and less relevant to particular target audiences
8045651 the networks and the stations have to recognize that theyre in the video information and entertainment delivery business a broadcast station limits what they can actually do
8045652 lets say on television you get a 20 cost per thousand rate fifty cents a click is equal to 500 cost per thousand you can see how much more expensive it is but the difference is theres some sort of action
8045653 the markets will trade in a nervous zig zag for the next few weeks said heinz gerd sonnenschein equity strategist at postbank in germany citing uncertain prospects for economic growth and hence for commodities and currencies as well as persistent financial industry worries
8045654 the german economy will face a sudden and sharp downturn in the second half of this year leading to a fully fledged recession brokerage steubing said in a note on the ifo data
8045655 corporate earnings are going to fall this and next year steubing said adding
8045656 hopes that the european central bank might cut interest rates earlier than expected
8045657 the portfolio renewal has started and this should boost profitability said pohjola analyst hannu rauhala newer and more expensive cellphone models usually have higher profit margins than older and cheaper ones
8045658 offering a high and secure dividend yield are likely to perform well over the next year due to a greater focus on total returns in a market with limited scope for capital appreciation
8045659 most stock market investors have not had a good year so far one trader said
8045660 im not going to discuss what peter and i talk about apart from the economy and the obvious fact that treasurer mr wayne swan doesnt seem to have much idea of what hes doing with australias economy
8045661 i have a very high regard for peter im fortunate to be able to attend and address a dinner in his honour in melbourne on friday night this week and well have to just wait and see
8045662 in two years time you and i will be sitting here having an interview in a pre election environment

8045664 spazzy 1st grader is it wrong to drop kick her into her classroom
8045665 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8045666 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8045667 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8045668 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8045669 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8045670 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8045671 weve had five people come forward that formed part of the initial investigation
8045672 and as a consequence to those five people coming forward weve identified another eight people so at this stage were speaking to 13 people
8045673 what we can say at this stage is that there is a number of lines of inquiry that have come from the initial inquiries
8045674 there are a number of inquiries continuing and there are some suspects involved
8045675 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8045676 there have been some major improvements within our facilities since last fall
8045677 what we are most excited about is that all four of these upgrades from the weight room to the fieldturf to the new lounge are improvements that benefit our players directly and that was really our first concern
8045678 our new weight room is a hugely important asset to our team and it is second to none in the big ten conference
8045679 sometimes if you do too much the pain reasserts itself but i should be up and flying the flag by september 15
8045680 i mean i suppose its a little slower than i thought and as the doctor said to me the other day it wasnt an operation it was an excavation
8045681 i cant i suppose expect to be up and doing marathons straight away and it is only five weeks since the operation
8045682 my understanding is he has got rid of all the cancers there is no evidence that it has jumped the fence
8045683 sometimes if you do too much the pain reasserts itself but i should be up and flying the flag by september 15
8045684 well just a couple of minutes after i got off of the phone with the senator his office received a call from the rnc profusely apologizing that his name was listed as a speaker erroneously doh

8045688 o executivo pol tico pode ter acesso a informa es constantes em processos de investiga o criminal

8045695 hes had a rocky relationship with the partys conservative base
8045696 the republican party is the next guy in line party whoever he picks as vice president could become the next guy in line if he picks a mainstream conservative then the conservatives can get excited not just about the mccain candidacy but the future of the party
8045697 a week ago romney and pawlenty looked like the two most likely conservative choices but i think over the last several days events have conspired against both of them
8045698 ive got nothing for you on the vp question he will select a fine running mate i dont know who that will be
8045699 i think his aides floated the idea of lieberman to prove to mccain that it would get knocked down
8045700 we will have to pledge ourselves to pledge to be worthy of him
8045701 nobodys fault nothing to be at fault no one to blame no one to offer or to take it
8045702 you must alas be attached to something or else a certain boredom supervenes there is a certain waving of loose ends upon the air
8045703 hes had a rocky relationship with the partys conservative base

8045710 hes had a rocky relationship with the partys conservative base

8045714 i think his aides floated the idea of lieberman to prove to mccain that it would get knocked down
8045715 selecting a whitman or fiorina may have made more sense when he was 12 points behind
8045716 if hes even in the polls he may be less likely to take a risk but then john mccain does like to take risks
8045717 o fluxo tem ficado um pouco negativo por esses dias o d lar deve oscilar entre r 1 62 e r 1 64 provavelmente nos pr ximos dias para voltar a operar abaixo de r 1 60 como no in cio do m s somente se cair abaixo de r 1 610
8045718 but i tell people are we supposed to be afraid of that and not go ahead and try to do something different
8045719 there are people who want to hurt barack obama because of his race and sometimes i fear for his safety
8045720 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
8045721 do you think they were really plotting to kill obama

8045734 nos satisface el pronunciamiento del presidente ch vez el domingo pasado diciendo que l se coloca del lado de las comunidades ind genas y en contra de los terratenientes sin embargo quiero expresar con mucho dolor que su pronunciamiento ha sido demasiado tarde porque al amparo de su silencio y de las actuaciones de su ministra se perpetraron masacres el asesinato selectivo de l deres vejaciones y violaciones de mujeres y ni as y un cerco militar que impide el libre tr nsito de quienes queremos expresar la solidaridad con nuestros hermanos ind genas
8045735 queremos hechos concretos de parte del gobierno que protejan los derechos ancestrales de los yupkas empezando por la destituci n de la ministra nicia maldonado no puede ser ministra del poder popular de los pueblos ind genas quien avala la propiedad usurpada por los terratenientes y sus bandas sicariales quien desconoce la legitimidad de los l deres e intenta reemplazarlos por otros que le sirvan a su pol tica a favor de los explotadores o quien exija a las comunidades que renuncien a sus derechos

8045743 la maquinaria de propaganda chavista utiliza m s de 400 radioemisoras 72 estaciones de televisi n y 18 peri dicos de cobertura local y nacional para promover candidatos y pol ticas chavistas
8045744 todo lo contrario nuestra visi n es que cada d a tengamos una mayor utilizaci n de internet por parte del pueblo y la ciudadan a esa es una herramienta muy til y que permite elevar el nivel de conocimiento de nuestro pueblo as que para nosotros es fundamental el poder penetrar en todos los sectores es una de las metas de la nueva cantv y el ministerio
8045745 nos hemos propuesto que ni un s lo grano de arroz ni de ma z producido por nuestro productores con todas las condiciones preferenciales que da el estado venezolano transfiera nuestras frontera de manera ilegal
8045746 el gobierno bolivariano trabaja para garantizar que el esfuerzo de los productores y la sociedad venezolana tenga el fin que queremos y que todos podamos comer arroz y ma z blanco en venezuela

8045749 cog 398 has pulled out from the pack and is in a solo lead with more than 304 hours billed this month will the pack ever be able to catch up
8045750 i tried to look at the history behind the issue who the parties were what happened at the trial day by day and the outcome and its effect
8045751 i went into it very naively oh 1 2 3 ill write a book
8045752 it was a lot more work than i thought it wasnt what i pictured but it was a great experience
8045753 the goal is to get a nationally released book sometime in the near future
8045754 holland amp knight as far as im concerned is the best firm in miami
8045755 when you talk about the combination of associate responsibility ability to do pro bono work compensation is commensurate with similarly situated law firms in miami
8045756 its difficult from the survey results to draw any overarching conclusions
8045757 weve always been focused on providing the best environment for associates that we can provide
8045758 in the last three years we have had lower associate attrition rates than our peer firms and that is the number that counts
8045759 it seemed to me like it was just like when i was in investment banking you were here to make money and that was the end of it
8045760 everyone i spoke to at holland amp knight said the same thing
8045761 it was all about we have a no jerks rule
8045762 weve really tried to re engineer some of the things that we were doing
8045763 the firm for a long time has been focused on a lot of issues dealing with associate satisfaction we invested a lot of money a lot of time and not everything we were doing was paying off
8045764 firms that have open communication with associates tend to have much happier
8045765 i was burned out on new york but i wanted to have the same quality of work
8045766 how often do you get to do billion dollar initial public offerings i havent pulled one all nighter in two years i used to do them once a month
8045767 weve always been concerned about associate retention thats nothing new
8045768 as akerman has grown i think akerman has had to develop strategies to incorporate within all of its offices and lawyer retention is no exception to that
8045769 theres no question were seeing what the marketplace is seeing which is more attrition than wed like
8045770 its between 18 and 22 percent thats a little better than the national average
8045771 midlevel associates no longer define success by the same standards that the old generation defines success meaning making partner sharing in the profits and sharing in the prestige
8045772 since firms are recognizing theres a different standard to success in this generation firms are faced with learning about what this generation of midlevel associates wants and how to give it to them
8045773 the hierarchy here is practically nonexistent it makes for a very pleasant working environment
8045774 but the event crystallized for me that i really had to fish or cut bait
8045775 people go down there and they come back and its just like theyve just come back from the heart of darkness
8045776 i said yes as long as i dont have to do any work
8045777 i didnt want to be a corporate lawyer who did human rights work i wanted to be a human rights lawyer doing human rights work
8045778 some people go through life without being able to find something that stokes within themselves that kind of passion
8045779 i said david are you serious hes a partner at covington that is like the goal of 90 percent of the kids at top law schools these days and hes going to walk away from it
8045780 my sense from the outside was that the guant namo litigation took over his entire life certainly his entire practice
8045781 id imagine his departure time was moved up as a result of the press conference
8045782 theres no way to explain it without sounding sanctimonious but it really is because i took an oath
8045783 now that ive been exposed to all this i cant see how i could ever again be happy litigating a fractious partnership agreement it just doesnt rise to the level of importance it used to
8045784 i just wasnt interested in the can i get three months of discovery or six months of discovery anymore there was something so much more important
8045785 based upon my experience with the detainees and my experience with the criminal court i can probably never go back to civil rights practice
8045786 at this point i cant do the work without their support
8045787 the firms expenses in connection with the gitmo matters have been and going forward will continue to be significant
8045788 ive been exposed to huge multinational law firms who have committed themselves to the very same thing
8045789 its not like these are movement lawyers who work in blue jeans
8045790 a black person can call me white but i cant call him black thats not my america
8045791 molto bene sono molto soddisfatto abbiamo visto una buona partecipazione e solidariet della gente ma oltre alle parole sebbene sincere e solidali ci aspettiamo che si prendano presto misure concrete per arrestare la ferocia dei criminali in darfur
8045792 it was very different than what i thought it would be which was a far left hammering of the president
8045793 republicans can look at it and say this is why i like this guy its not a political movie its a biography people will remember that this guy is human when we are always outside of the movie dehumanizing him calling him an idiot a puppet a failed president we want to know in the movie how does a guy grow up and become the person that he did
8045794 we dont have drill him for way he ran his administration its all out there we concentrate on the compelling nature of someone who has no real deep interest in or training for the presidency but who did it twice
8045795 i think history is going to be very tough on dubya
8045796 just keep your ego in check im the president im the decider he barked at the vp
8045797 in response to questions this is quote from me brendan daly spokesman for speaker nancy pelosi in response to questions about her comments on meet the press on abortion on sunday
8045798 the speaker is the mother of five children and seven grandchildren and
8045799 after she was elected to congress and the choice issue became more public as she would have to vote on it she studied the matter more closely
8045800 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception
8045801 the speaker has a long proud record of working with the catholic church on many issues including alleviating poverty and promoting social justice and peace
8045802 i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8045803 more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church
8045804 im going to assume from her remark that she had a fundamental misunderstanding of the catholic opposition to abortion as a fundamental teaching of the church
8045805 i hope she understands this is not an historical controversy recently settled but a long standing fundamental teaching of the catholic church that abortion is inherently immoral and perhaps it will help open her heart
8045806 scandalous is the word that many catholics use when they feel that a catholic elected official of the highest rank fundamentally is erroneous about what is catholic teaching or not
8045807 crews when they arrived a short period of time after they were told there was a child inside
8045808 there were initially five children ranging from age two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8045809 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out
8045810 currently in the legislation it says you have to have a smoke alarm on every floor in a house what were saying is you should have smoke alarm in every bedroom

8045814 criminologists warn that juvenile offenders who are thrown in with adult prisoners are exposed to social pressures and develop personal contacts that make it far more likely that they will become career criminals than those held in juvenile facilities

8045825 nosso time est desesperado parece que o ltimo jogo do campeonato
8045826 a number of shots were fired from a vehicle into a house as a result an 18 year old male suffered gunshot wounds
8045827 we are deeply troubled by the growing gap between the rich and poor in our state it is unacceptable that in such a resource rich environment thousands of women and families live in poverty if we are to eradicate poverty we need to come together to identify and support lasting solutions
8045828 we all know intuitively that 19 806 for a family of two adults and two children is just a fraction of whats needed to make ends meet in fact other measures of family expenses such as self sufficiency standards and family budgets that show us whats really necessary for a family to get by would indicate that far more of new yorks women are in families with incomes that dont cover the basics
8045829 the federal poverty standard is woefully inadequate in new york state especially
8045830 even with the great strides women have made in higher education over the years the additional qualifications attained by full time women workers at this juncture have only allowed them to catch up to the earnings of less well educated men
8045831 higher education undoubtedly gives womens earnings a big boost but it has yet to put women on a par with men
8045832 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8045833 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8045834 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8045835 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8045836 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8045837 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8045838 weve had five people come forward that formed part of the initial investigation
8045839 and as a consequence to those five people coming forward weve identified another eight people so at this stage were speaking to 13 people
8045840 what we can say at this stage is that there is a number of lines of inquiry that have come from the initial inquiries
8045841 there are a number of inquiries continuing and there are some suspects involved
8045842 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8045843 now we have nancy pelosi bloviating and i say that in an affectionate way behind us
8045844 it doesnt seem like the crowd is on the edge of their seats
8045845 n o estamos lutando contra o rebaixamento uma luta desse tipo s acontece quando faltam quatro ou cinco jogos para o final do campeonato estamos passando por um mau momento mas que iremos reverter com o trabalho
8045846 o elenco da portuguesa bom temos um time de qualidade mas que est passando por um momento que n o dos melhores uma situa o preocupante mas totalmente revers vel
8045847 n s jogamos muito atr s no primeiro tempo n o conseguimos sair dali porque a marca o do crb foi muito forte e porque n s n o nos movimentamos tanto
8045848 eu percebi que o goleiro estava adiantado e realmente bati para o gol mas claro que foi um lance de muita felicidade e eu fico contente porque a bola entrou
8045849 n s estamos trabalhando bastante a defici ncia individual e notamos uma evolu o no grupo mas isso exige intensidade e dedica o e por isso eu refor o tanto a import ncia dos treinos o trabalho do dia a dia que vai me dizer o que mudar na equipe
8045850 n s tivemos a chance de vencer nos dois jogos mas n o conseguimos complicado voc dar tantos pontos de gra a em uma competi o equilibrada como o campeonato brasileiro e n s precisamos entender o que est acontecendo
8045851 claro que h jogos em que seu advers rio superior mas o mais preocupante quando voc sente que tem condi es de vencer e n o consegue por conta dos seus erros isso que n s n o podemos aceitar
8045852 precisamos acertar as coisas precisamos ser mais eficientes e temos de aproveitar as chances para vencer os jogos isso importante em uma competi o equilibrada e pode determinar nossa situa o no fim do ano
8045853 ainda n o foi passado nada de t o diferente para a gente mas espero que at amanh quarta feira cedo possa acontecer algo desse tipo isso mais quest o do adilson
8045854 a man must have multiple wives if he expects to do well in heaven where he can eventually become a god and wind up with his own planet
8045855 required to take on the job of protecting gods chosen people
8045856 many of us in the fundamentalist faith drank coffee tea beer and wine all of which is strictly forbidden in mainstream mormonism
8045857 when uncle rulon first came to power girls didnt marry until they were over twenty after his first stroke the age dropped into the late teens the sicker he got the younger the brides in the community became
8045858 i mmoral acts for which there could be no forgiveness such as fornication and adultery
8045859 merril spread my legs apart but could not get an erection i felt angry humiliated and embarrassed should i fight him i began to try to free myself and after a few minutes he released his hold on me
8045860 a devout wife would never even desire to eat something her husband disliked
8045861 producing large numbers of faithful children was a way for a woman to gain favor not only with her husband but with god it wasnt uncommon for a woman in the community to have as many as sixteen children and most had at least twelve
8045862 a doctor was never present nor was pain medication ever used women were expected to be perfectly silent during childbirth if a woman screamed or made loud noises she was criticized for being out of control sometimes shed be reprimanded by her husband during her delivery
8045863 was given an episiotomy with sewing scissors and then stitched up with dental floss
8045864 began preaching that anyone who needed medical help to heal was a person of little faith a person in harmony with god could heal him or herself with fasting and prayer
8045865 you can take him to every damn doctor you can find but no one will be able to heal him god is going to destroy his life because of the sins of his mother
8045866 one day he brought one of his wives into the school auditorium which was packed with boys annette had a long braid that fell past her knees warren grabbed the braid and twisted and twisted it until she was on her knees and he was ripping hair from her head he told the boys that this was how obedient their wives had to be to them
8045867 couldnt stop talking about how she and all the righteous people she knew saw the hand of god in the attacks warren jeffs had been preaching that the entire earth would soon be at war and all the worthy among the chosen would be lifted from the earth and protected while god destroyed the wicked
8045868 two days after her 18th birthday betty returned to the flds fold
8045869 rumors that children were being taken from their mothers and sent to the flds compound in texas we heard they were being sent away to be raised the way warren wanted them to be raised

8045871 n o estamos negociando com o dod e ele n o est na nossa pauta agora
8045872 some fisheries including that for cod are now known to cause juvenescence or the evolution of younger smaller adult fish the ecological and economic consequences both appear to be negative
8045873 the big concern is that overexploitation is causing the fish to evolve
8045874 the finding that humans can actually cause evolution of fish populations which in turn can drive their degradation is relatively new and is drawing a lot of attention
8045875 al capitalismo no le interesa que se acaben los pobres y esa es la guerra en contra de una revoluci n que ha sacado de la pobreza a 12 millones de venezolanos
8045876 pasamos de ser un pa s con 80 de pobreza y hoy estamos en 33 lo que significa que en apenas 10 a os la revoluci n redujo el ndice de pobreza en casi 50 puntos
8045877 de los cuales 20 millones viv an en condiciones de pobreza y 30 de ellos 6 millones en pobreza extrema
8045878 esos 20 millones de venezolanos que viv an en condiciones de pobreza ya se redujeron a 8 millones y los 6 millones que habitaban en pobreza extrema bajaron a 2 millones 300 mil
8045879 la pobreza es quiz s una de las epidemias m s horrorosas de la humanidad porque mata a la gente de hambre a gente que no tiene capacidad de hacer al menos una comida diaria
8045880 la pobreza se ha ido derrotando con el esfuerzo constancia y solidaridad de mujeres que cuentan con el apoyo del gobierno revolucionario para alimentar a los venezolanos m s pobres
8045881 eso es justo lo que la contrarrevoluci n no quiere que se haga porque al capitalismo no le interesa que se acaben los pobres y por eso se opone a que el gobierno de venezuela le d cada d a m s poder a los pobres
8045882 mientras el socialismo abre casas de alimentaci n y lucha por derrotar a la pobreza el capitalismo apuesta a que la cifra de pobres se multiplique

8045912 we didnt want an escalation of the kind of tumultuous behavior caused by the coaching staff
8045913 screw these kids who do they think they are not doing what theyre told and the coach not bending over for us hah well show them
8045914 the obama campaign knows it cant argue the facts of the link between obama and ayers so it is instead resorting to a desperate campaign of intimidation and legal threats
8045915 the scary question this raises is if barack obama demonstrates this little regard for free speech from his opponents during the campaign what could the american people expect from him as a president
8045916 the tremendous amount of time money and effort the campaign is expending to run its own ads on the ayers controversy and dispatch its hired guns all over the country during the democratic convention speaks to the fear they must have that this issue is resonating with american voters
8045917 this investment led by dcm will enable miox to take full advantage of its outstanding and proven on site generation technology and move more rapidly into strategic markets

8045923 coffee culture has created a dialogue to talk about tea
8045924 its okay to drink tea on the go like coffee im introducing people to tea in an environment they are used to
8045925 then you find out you like earl grey tea and then start ordering earl grey then you realize i like black tea and find out youre a tea drinker
8045926 the idea was to create a spa like serene environment where you wouldnt feel rushed
8045927 reflect the countless ways that later artists have commandeered and recontextualized images and materials
8045928 theres nothing better than when youths are doing something responsible for their community
8045929 i strongly believe that as kids create they do not destroy
8045930 the reaction of the children is amazing to watch what if were caught was the question they always ask me i tell them that theyre being asked to restore these benches and that theyre being given an opportunity to show they care
8045931 the project got lots of people together who wouldnt have otherwise gotten together in those days
8045932 in the next 30 years they might start pushing the benches up from the ground
8045933 some of the kids today have brief attention spans and some come here and start looking for cans of spray paint its all about immediate gratification for them but then we teach them about mixing cement and applying grout and their interest begins to take hold

8045942 and what did norm think about it i see well that makes a lot of sense ok well that will be an interesting meeting why dont you call me back when you find out ok bye
8045943 if strategy is to be lived and achieved it must be publicly tracked measured and monitored if you are trying to lose weight you must get on the scales regularly even if you weigh yourself regularly but keep the results private you escape accountability how much more forceful would it be if you let your spouse see each time what you weigh or better yet let your children monitor your progress
8045944 webbs breakthrough ideas show how marketing selling and servicing functions can be approached as a process with input and outputs causes and effects i highly recommend this book to all senior executives whether they are aiming for better forecasting better market share higher margins or reduced cost of sales it will completely change the way you view sales and marketing and help you get a handle on sales process improvement
8045945 hats off to mike webb for tackling this challenging subject improving sales and marketing is like training your cat to come when you call it its an interesting thing to think about but full of pitfalls to the uninitiated mike however is very initiated and this book does a good job of showing you how quantitative methods can apply to a traditionally hard to manage business its not that sales forces dont have metrics you could argue that they have the ultimate metric did we make the sale like your cat these groups seem to have a mind of their own and the cause and effect of the activities that go into making the sale arent usually methodically examined and improved mike shows you how to do that with style
8045946 think about it marketing and sales can easily represent nearly half of your companys annual expenses this expense is far from being optimized when 9 out 10 leads are typically discarded early in the sales cycle companies that do not apply a systematic and truly accountable approach to blending marketing and sales will undoubtedly struggle to survive in this increasingly competitive business climate this book concisely applies practical six sigma methods to help companies boost customer value and realize greater roi out of their marketing and sales investment if you know theres room for improvement between your marketing and sales teams i highly recommend you leverage this book as a key competitive advantage
8045947 this book is essential reading for anyone in sales and marketing mike webbs unique perspective is captured in this excellent roadmap on how to organize measure and lead both marketers and sellers to greater success
8045948 michael webb has once again demonstrated his clear and systematic thinking about delivering value to customers in this must read book sales and marketing the six sigma way in this book mike provides tools to help measure your sales processes in terms important to your customers then you can continuously improve your processes of finding winning and keeping customers
8045949 sales and marketing organizations have historically been slow in adopting the benefits of six sigma for a variety of reasons especially because of the effort required to
8045950 michael webb has a very incisive clear headed approach to untangling complex sales problems sales and marketing the six sigma way breaks the sales funnel into its component parts and systematically identifies bottlenecks and disconnects that waste your time and resources selling might have been done by the seat of the pants in the 20th century but that isnt going to work now those who miss this shift will find themselves further and further behind quotas and locked in a corporate pressure cooker but those who recognize and act will discover that the current business climate can be enormously rewarding and profitable this book is not a sales rah rah session it takes enormously successful methods from manufacturing and applies them to the toughest job in your company getting orders from customers i wholeheartedly recommend michael and his innovative methods
8045951 michael webb brings true understanding to sales and marketing through process thinking if you want a harmonious relationship between sales marketing and customer service that will drive customer value you need to read this book
8045952 if you dont know what you have done to succeed or what has caused you to fail you are leaving your destiny to chance in our experience when you understand and remove obstacles to your customers achieving their objectives you create customer value by helping them succeed in addition putting your own processes under the microscope can reveal the whats inhibiting you from achieving your sales goals michael webbs straightforward approach to sales and marketing using the popular six sigma method is presented with a sense of humor and lots of examples well worth your time
8045953 if more books on the subject were as concise and fun to read as sales and marketing the six sigma way the business world would be a better place the book will provide sales and marketing executives with money making tools they can use daily
8045954 applying six sigma to sales and marketing initially i was skeptical but after reading this book im a believer applying these principles correctly will help sales managers solve many of the challenges they face every day in their quest to improve sales performance
8045955 it isnt often that i can recommend a six sigma book because reducing defects tends to be product focused and internally oriented this book is not only different but better than any other six sigma book ive ever seen because it actually shows how to use it to increase the value of your relationships and experiences with your customers this is the way six sigma should be done
8045956 the name of the game is not to design the sales process around ourselves but to create customer value sales and marketing the six sigma way is relevant to all executives who are looking to deliver maximum results internally and externally
8045957 utmost confidence that hideo kojima ken imaizumi and our amazing team will put together another blockbuster game
8045958 the money was supposed to go towards our vacation but we probably lost that much in the casinos
8045959 whether were together or not in 10 years 20 years 40 years well have the magazine layout to look at and remember some incredible sex filled times
8045960 people were real bummed when we took that thing away
8045961 the shell is great shape but the cockpit and interior were pretty well trashed out
8045962 i was always a popular girl with more boyfriends than i could date in a week
8045963 i was always a popular girl with more boyfriends than i could date in a week
8045964 when i took the gavel from the former chairman i told him this elections have consequences and when we win in november we will prove it
8045965 instead of protecting polluters well protect our families instead of ignoring the experts we will fight global warming instead of facing republican roadblocks well have a democratic majority large enough to ensure healthy communities
8045966 and i want you to remember this when it comes to the united states senate 60 is the new 50
8045967 now when it comes to high gas prices instead of a president with an exxon policy well have a president with an energy policy
8045968 so this november we cant afford more of the same so lets elect barack obama so that the worlds economic and environmental leader will clearly be our nation the united states of america
8045969 i have a second monitor thats set to 1280 x 1024 at the office id go blind if i didnt have that
8045970 the new rules of race in the workplace what every professional should know and doesnt
8045971 i write so that you may know how you ought to conduct yourselves in the house of god which is the church of god the pillar stylos and ground of the truth
8045972 struck the child that uriahs wife bore to david and it became ill
8045973 your name shall no longer be called jacob but israel for you have struggled with god and with men and have prevailed
8045974 i dont think people vote for a candidate because of the spouse but they might vote against them because of the spouse
8045975 the spouse cant help but they can hurt youve seen a couple instances where theyve pulled the spouse back like john kerry s wife the campaign kept her pretty much off the scene
8045976 the gains that occurred last year were welcome but unfortunately they are too little too late
8045977 the median household is no better off now than they were back in 2000 despite their deep contribution to the nations economic growth during this period
8045978 the american work force is baking a bigger economic pie but the slices havent grown at all
8045979 its clear that the long period of strong economic growth we were in had a positive impact for most americans
8045980 obviously today were dealing with higher energy prices and the downturn in housing but the economy is showing enough resilience to keep growing in spite of those challenges
8045981 too many of our neighbors are living in poverty too many cant find a job and too many are living without health insurance
8045982 this november the torch will be passed to a new generation of americans
8045983 if i cant have consequence free sex neither can you
8045984 all you need to do to go to heaven is ask jesus into your heart
8045985 youre going to burn in hell if you dont say this prayer little boy
8045986 dear jesus thank you for coming into my heart and saving me
8045987 dear jesus where in the bible do you tell us to ask you into our hearts that seems kind weird and why did the ancient world think the heart was the kidney hello can you hear me i guess this is just a one way intercom how can i know if youre still around if you dont say anything back okay if youre really there appear to me right now in person like you did to paul
8045988 what exactly does jesus do in my blood pumping organ
8045989 any juicy tidbits about your life i can spread through the prayer gossip grapevine
8045990 thanks for asking youre so kind my wife is having an affair my brother is a drunk and my dog cant control his sexual desires
8045991 have you ever kept a prayer journal to see if you get more unanswered prayers than answered ones or if your unasked prayers get answered just as much
8045992 im a racist asshole who attends an all white church and is uncomfortable around most black people i love racist jokes and am about to tell you a good one
8045993 i only believe this about overwhelming situations the rest of the time i believe things are up to us and i act that way
8045994 if gods in control then relax and dont do anything about it in fact you dont have to do anything at all ever right but thats not right and people still have to do everything so what does it mean for god to be in control and why does it matter
8045995 i have no clue about the history of that big book im in love with and i dont care either because its gods word and if god said it it must be true
8045996 it also says to kill your children when they talk back have your children ever talked back
8045997 explain to me the authorship and transmission of the bible and why you think its gods word
8045998 jesus said to give anything to those who ask of you and not only to give what they ask but more so please give me your wallet and your car
8045999 oh jesus jesus i love jesus my beautiful king and savior
8046000 gods been teaching me about how much evidence there is for evolution
8046001 thats a relief because im a homosexual transvestite in an interracial relationship
8046002 america isnt mentioned in the bible because were going to crumble soon
8046003 did you know that out of the millions of times christians have claimed this throughout history theyve always been wrong
8046004 if youre so confident im sure youll be confident in putting some significant money towards a bet on that
8046005 if that were true why doesnt he tell me himself
8046006 do you know where youre going to go after you die
8046007 this is the question they told me to ask in my evangelism class
8046008 what would you say if you stood before god after you die
8046009 please forgive me i was so fracking stupid how blind of me not to see you in everything you created
8046010 if you wanted me to believe in you why didnt you show some kind of evidence why create everything through the painful process of evolution why did you let your creation suffer through hunger neglect disease and war why incarnate yourself and then commit deicide suicide why were you so bloodthirsty in the early years if youre god youre not a very good one
8046011 its easier to thank jesus than the people who deserve it
8046012 instead of praying why dont you read a non christian book
8046013 the bible says somewhere to say this and i feel uber spiritual whenever i do
8046014 how would you know if its the lord stopping you or just your laziness
8046015 i was a guilt ridden sinner until i hit rock bottom and then believed in jesus and my sins were forgiven
8046016 thats a great story how can i have my sins forgiven and go to heaven
8046017 the reason youre telling your story is because its impossible for me to say you didnt have that experience unfortunately people have religious experiences all the time and many of them have nothing to do with jesus your story is nice but its easier to fool yourself than you might think you dont know the truth about god and jesus and the bible through an emotional experience but through evidence and youll find that lacking
8046018 my brain cant comprehend how this could happen without the god of the universe getting involved so it must be true
8046019 exactly how else could they have called when you were thinking of them except for god to control them like a puppet to impress you
8046020 it seems you dont understand probability theory let me explain
8046021 it takes more faith to be an atheist than a christian
8046022 i dont really understand atheism or how its possible not to believe in a god
8046023 believing in something without evidence takes faith not believing in something without evidence takes intelligence
8046024 atheism is a religion because everyone believes there is a god right
8046025 they know there is a god and they reject him and hate him they will burn in hell forever
8046026 calling atheism a religion is like calling bald a hair color
8046027 it doesnt make any sense to me either but thats what the bible says
8046028 if every hard question ends with mystery how can you be so confident you are right
8046029 i hope he doesnt ask if i attend church every week
8046030 cant every religion claim they are about a relationship with god
8046031 if youre not a religion why do you attend church read the bible believe in orthodoxy and are trying to convert me
8046032 if he is the answer the question must be ridiculous
8046033 we had a lot of people serve in a lot of dangerous places other than korea and vietnam
8046034 there were 40 aircraft shot down and 116 soldiers missing in action from the cold war
8046035 too often when these young men and women return home from service we do not honor their bravery with the full measure of respect and gratitude that it deserves
8046036 i believe we should take this opportunity to help ensure that our veterans regardless of the timeframe of their service receive appropriate recognition and benefits
8046037 there were a lot of sacrifices made and people served a lot of hazardous duty during that time

8046052 barack obama is a fine person but i dont think he is ready to be president
8046053 i dont think he has the judgment which is developed through years of experience in life that prepares him for assuming the title of president of the united states and commanding the most powerful military and guiding the most powerful economy

8046058 im not here to talk about my qualifications im talking about why john mccain has the qualifications to be president
8046059 in some we were successful in some we failed in every case i can remember it was our objective to grow and make more successful the enterprise

8046071 its actually a little funny in a way but a sad sad commentary on the state of our country
8046072 this is bigger than just me there are 150 million women in america and this could happen to any of them
8046073 we do everything we can to ensure that a passenger doesnt feel humiliated
8046074 they cant find bombs in checked luggage and theyre essentially doing a pat down of private parts this is a security apparatus that is out of control
8046075 the way we treat fiction nowadays seems to indicate a lack of willingness to think things through apply standards or follow any of a number of other practices essential to critical thinking
8046076 ideas matter emotions matter dreams and goals and values and ethics matter and if all these things matter then fiction which deals with all these things and more besides most definitely matters

8046151 i think his aides floated the idea of lieberman to prove to mccain that it would get knocked down
8046152 selecting a whitman or fiorina may have made more sense when he was 12 points behind
8046153 if hes even in the polls he may be less likely to take a risk but then john mccain does like to take risks
8046154 hes a veteran a laid back guy and we play at a different level we like to run and do all those kinds of things we were just looking for a little different thing thats probably why it didnt work out here
8046155 i mean if it was a problem i wish someone would have told me
8046156 look at this as a beginning not an end to the process
8046157 you have to recognize the parapets are not designed for tractor trailers
8046158 the bridge is safe we have taken a proactive approach here in response to the aug 10 accident
8046159 some detergents did better on certain stains but you want a detergent thats going to do the best job on most stains
8046160 well the dallas mavericks got beat by the new orleans hornets last night ending their season word is that someone on the team is dating jessica simpson
8046161 i got the cast off last week the results were good
8046162 the fracture is stable and im right to get back into cricket it was frustrating for a while because it took a little bit longer to get right over the last two days ive had a great chance to test it out and ive had no problems
8046163 its the first time ive had the opportunity to keep in australia since adam retired im jumping at the bit to have an opportunity to play in front of an australian crowd
8046164 in the early days it was a little difficult getting used to that but i think as you get older and you mature more for a personal point of view im not really fussed these days im pretty comfortable in the role ive been playing at six and seven in the middle order
8046165 of the 2519 batsmen who have taken the crease in 131 years of test cricket bradman stands alone and untouched
8046166 i am not aware of any other sport which has one competitor so far above any other performer
8046167 he dominated cricket for 20 years from his debut in 1928 to his retirement 60 years ago this month and if he had not lost eight years of his career to world war ii his figures would no doubt be better still at every olympics plenty of records are broken bradman remains unassailable
8046168 as a team we do try and score at least 300 runs a day in test cricket
8046169 in honour of bradmans legacy thats the least we can do
8046170 there are thousands of kids in every generation who grow up in australia wanting to scale the heights of the greatest cricketer who ever lived
8046171 as boys and girls discovering the great joys and mysteries of playing and watching cricket we might not know much about don bradman the man but we quickly realise the magnitude of his achievements
8046172 theres no need to even look at the record books to know there is no comparison

8046179 la carrera de la muerte es una forma de entretenimiento adulta y sin lugar a dudas es el tipo de filme que me gusta
8046180 tiene chicas atractivas y sensuales personajes varoniles acci n y velocidad qu m s se puede pedir
8046181 con la carrera de la muerte quise ser fiel al tono ligeramente irreverente de death race 2000 la cinta original que me sirvi de inspiraci n pero sin ser exagerado la historia es m s seria y la pel cula es m s sombr a pero con algunos toques de comedia es un filme distinto pero lo mismo que el primer filme tiene un mensaje de cr tica social

8046195 todays august 25 announcement about the possibility of building a road course at kansas speedway is exciting for not only race fans but also for the tens of thousands of members of car clubs
8046196 our ability to cross promote a premium gaming entertainment and retail destination development and state of the art road course at kansas speedway will attract car clubs not only in the region but from across the country this business model helps support our investment in the construction of the road course and more importantly will drive higher tourism dollars for the kansas city area
8046197 as the largest active motorsports membership organization in north america scca would certainly welcome and support another venue to host events
8046198 any time isc has included a road racing course within one of its facilities it has been nothing short of first class
8046199 it was kind of pathetic to tell you the truth
8046200 it makes me think i should have read the label a little closer
8046201 the theory is that the sweeter formula will want to make them want to eat more but still the parent is the one controlling how much theyre eating with each feeding so as long as theyre eating a healthy amount with each feeding its not going to be a difference as far as obesity long term wise
8046202 we view this as two separate criminal justice systems one of white community and one for the african american community
8046203 for joe deters to say he cant find any law after a baby is dead for negligence for homicide for anything is just unacceptable
8046204 we dont know whether our prosecutor is going to charge mrs edwards or not but what we do know is that his handling of the case is very different than other cases weve been involved with involving african americans
8046205 race does not and absolutely should not play a decision in whether charges should be filed
8046206 each case is different so its really hard sometimes to make a comparison its apples and oranges often

8046354 he was a pioneer said bruce davis executive director of arts council silicon valley
8046355 he was a great local hero to me said nancy wiener who served on arts committees with schiro through the years
8046356 he had a very classy elegant look about him but he also had that soft touch as strong an advocate as henry was for the things he believed in he never came on really strong he worked with you in a very gentle way
8046357 anytime he picked up to call someone for a donation they never said no said marilyn dorsa who chaired the medici ball with mr

8046382 i couldnt imagine why she was so excited i thought cant everyone do this
8046383 he gave lots of lessons and was always asking me to sit for him
8046384 i was a very grumpy 13 year old and i had all of these posters of movie stars on my walls on saturdays my best friend and i would go up on her roof and cut out pictures of our favorite stars from movie magazines and paste them into our scrapbooks we especially loved nelson eddy wed hold his photos up and tell him we were going to show him an australian sunset
8046385 i dont know how it came to me to try watercolor but when i did it was so much faster and easier than making all those little strokes from then on pen and ink were out
8046386 i love painting eyes they really are the windows to the soul
8046387 if i see a photograph of a face and it has good contrast ill do a painting its especially good if the person isnt showing any teeth i hate to paint teeth
8046388 in those days the stars were always being asked for autographs so it wasnt such a big deal
8046389 every time id paint a celebrity id send a duplicate of the painting so he or she could keep it making a copy was much quicker than painting the original
8046390 id like to kiss ya but i just washed my hair
8046391 her assistant was also named marie and she would call occasionally to chat she told me that alice received many paintings and drawings of herself but marees are the best i shouldnt say so but i liked hearing that

8046399 i could have used those a while back when i had a mastectomy but its been 4 1 2 years now and im still cancer free so im very thankful for that
8046400 love is the net where hearts are caught like fish
8046401 i wrote to him asking if he would sign a portrait of him that i had done
8046402 he wrote back saying he would have to see it first i wrote back to him saying if i were in your position id do the same and enclosed the painting with a self addressed stamped envelope sure enough he autographed it and sent it back
8046403 i wrote to sen obama asking for a picture he sent back a lovely photograph of his wife and him along with his autograph

8046407 obviously i think this is one of those things that travellers are going to expect and airlines will feel the need to provide
8046408 we have talked to both of the canadian carriers as well as carriers in mexico
8046409 all of them have shown a lot of interest were a little bit further along with some than others in getting to an agreement with them
8046410 we are actively engaged in discussions with in flight internet providers and are expecting to make further announcements later this autumn
8046411 its definitely something we have been looking at weve looked at a couple of different options
8046412 the airlines are looking for any sort of revenue they can get
8046413 it makes very good sense to have it on an airplane for a reasonable price

8046415 could i just mention to you jay that at a moment of seriousness i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spend those five and a half years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
8046416 has definitely had conversations with microsoft about doing a new halo game and is very excited at the prospect
8046417 you can basically dictate the distribution rights on any object you create
8046418 if you put something in your level as a collectable item people can collect it people can control who comes into the level both by how hard it is and by giving away keys but you can also choose whether to copyright that object
8046419 no challenge too great for a world that stands as one
8046420 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8046421 nationals policy like labours would permit toll roads only where a free alternative route was available

8046424 what the report shows is that there has been some change but its pretty minor
8046425 this isnt progress the changes are insignificant and we would need to see this happen for 10 years to say there has been progress
8046426 if you look at the numbers theres bad news in the story
8046427 and even into poverty where they are caught by the public healthcare program safety net
8046428 it doesnt capture what it costs to meet some of a familys basic necessities
8046429 even using those low standards more families especially with children are sliding into poverty and becoming eligible for public programs
8046430 it still assumes that american families spend about one third of their budget on food but whats really punishing american families are housing and energy costs
8046431 by every measure 2008 is going to be worse clearly there are going to be increasing problems growth in poverty and higher unemployment especially among unskilled workers

8046435 as for the accce coalition it was founded this year solely to address the advancing legislation aimed at cutting the emissions of fossil fuels like coal that are blamed for global warming

8046439 some countries spend more on subsidizing oil than they do on health and education combined
8046440 in the final analysis many fossil fuel subsidies are introduced for political reasons but are simply propping up and perpetuating inefficiencies in the global economy
8046441 urgently review their energy subsidies and begin phasing out the harmful ones
8046442 its clearly an area that we need to re examine in our fight against climate change
8046443 our demonstration of the environmental sensitivity of alpine lake ecosystems highlights both their vulnerability and usefulness as indicators of the effects of global warming and the predicted increases in climatic variability
8046444 the climate regime in the 2000s altered the character and the function of high elevation aquatic ecosystem
8046445 forecasts of increased temperature and climatic variability in the future pose serious ramifications for both the biodiversity and ecosystem function of high elevation lakes
8046446 the money was supposed to go towards our vacation but we probably lost that much in the casinos
8046447 whether were together or not in 10 years 20 years 40 years well have the magazine layout to look at and remember some incredible sex filled times

8046449 and he said to him you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
8046450 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
8046451 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
8046452 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
8046453 the company knowingly stole from its customers mostly poor people and the recently deceased when it designed and implemented the sweeps
8046454 when a whistleblower uncovered the scam and brought it to his superiors they buried the information and continued the illegal practice
8046455 we take issue with the states characterization of our conduct and the parties voluntary settlement
8046456 this agreement affirms our actions and we are continuing to make full refunds to all affected customers
8046457 i do not pray for these only but also for those who believe in me through their word that they may all be one even as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also might be in us so that the world may believe that thou has sent me
8046458 and he said to him you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind
8046459 home prices are down 15 4 from a year ago
8046460 the research is clear if developed countries spent the same amount of money on preventing deforestation and the destruction of peatlands as they do on misguided biofuel subsidies 15bn this would halve the total costs of tackling climate change
8046461 in addition to this the protection of these habitats yields a plethora of valuable eco system services particularly in the poorest countries
8046462 this approach would be dramatically cheaper than any other means of achieving the same result to be truly effective a global response is needed but the uk has an opportunity to lead the way
8046463 in the uk we can dramatically increase funding for forest and peatland projects domestically and with key partners especially in south east asia as well as lobbying at an international level for the right global policies
8046464 forest and peatland conservation is one of the few methods at our disposal where we can do this now and at low cost
8046465 this report is timely and welcome it is becoming increasingly clear that unless we find a practical solution to the problems caused by deforestation the battle against climate change is in danger of being lost
8046466 the hypocrisy of the government is staggering while ministers are calling for the international community to look at the impact of biofuels here in the uk the governments policy means people are filling up their cars with biofuels that may be damaging the environment and endangering food security

8046483 i spent those five and half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got back home

8046518 barack obama showed a lot about his leadership style by picking someone that he doesnt always agree with
8046519 weve already seen the disastrous results when the president surrounds himself with yes men
8046520 hes experienced hes catholic and ohio needs help with the catholics
8046521 our poor friends from the hawaii delegation are located somewhere in northern new mexico it seems
8046522 that depends on what kind of effort obama makes in ohio if he makes the effort comes to talk to our people visits our communities talks about the issues that really matter hell win

8047003 we have probably failed to understand that the russians are really quite serious when they say we have interests and were going to defend them
8047004 we were training saakashvilis army and he was getting at least a corps of highly trained individuals which he could use for adventures the feeling in the intelligence community was that this was a very high risk endeavour
8047005 he just said that he felt it was best to go the junior college route
8047006 he had never told me anything i only want people that want to be a part of our program be a part of our institution and be a part of our family i wish trevor nothing but the best and i know his teammates feel the same way i was shocked by the news

8047009 the us is now losing the war against the taliban
8047010 the feds the police had us up against the wall and some of us on the floor being handcuffed until they searched us then they just let us go because they know we hadnt done anything wrong
8047011 well be running an operation across london targeting people on their way to the event
8047012 i completely freaked out i thought i was going to be murdered in my bed
8047013 weve apologised and told the group how to claim for damage
8047014 lets all go and resist residents interests dont include solidarity with travellers
8047015 ive lived in italy for 17 years i was born in serbia but my parents died here and are buried here all my children were born here we lost everything when we left serbia we have no ties left with that country
8047016 where we live isnt even fit for dogs look at how we live we are next to an open sewer in the winter we have a major fire risk because these shacks are all made of wood my shack has burned down three times once when it burned down we were left with nothing but the clothes we were wearing
8047017 our shack is also damp because of the mud from the sewer we have one toilet to serve over 100 people we have to wash ourselves from a plastic tub the council does nothing for us
8047018 there is mud everywhere when my daughter goes to school i have to carry a flannel with me to remove the mud from her shoes i dont want my children to have this life
8047019 we have been homeless for the past 12 years all of my family are living in car parks my wife had bronchitis she caught a cold from sleeping outside we sent her to the hospital the following day she died
8047020 i was born here in rome but the authorities put me in detention for 60 days for no reason they wont give me a passport or an id card
8047021 my brother adja was killed by a drunken italian motorist six weeks ago he died because he was sleeping in the streets
8047022 my children were taken into care because i was living in the streets the authorities tell me i cant have my children back until i find a home
8047023 i was born here in rome but im still a foreigner my children were born here they too remain foreigners
8047024 we are in the same position as clandestine immigrants who come from africa or albania i have never been to the land of my parents
8047025 it seems as if italy is becoming like the 1940s when benito mussolini and the fascists were in charge for me this is no longer a free country the government is putting soldiers on the streets against immigrants why we are not at war
8047026 i came here from bosnia with my husband 40 years ago
8047027 i was living in another camp in rome until two years ago it was much better than here we built our own shacks and had our market stalls
8047028 now the council has put us in these metal boxes in the middle of nowhere they are too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter we do not have adequate running water or electricity this place is laid out like a concentration camp
8047029 and if you dont have a car you are a prisoner here look at the dust my children have to play in it is no good for their health all my children were born here but they are not citizens and receive no welfare

8047063 she has always been proud to be an american and the fact that we as americans are making an effort to put our racist amp sexist past behind us and show the world that in this country all people including those that have been treated like in this country have a chance at running our coutry raises her level of pride to heights she has never known

8047092 all my latinos and latinas lets see you vote for obama
8047093 its like hes sort of like brand new to latinos the best way to explain it is say i just came out with a record you know and its my first record and its like yo i want all the latinos to go buy the album but when i do a song with like carlos santana or a shakira or evee queen then the latinos say oh clef is part of our same cause you know what i mean so we support his music what obama just needs to do is just he needs to be out there and get in front of them and talk to them like personal you know what i mean and i think hes definitely willing to do that
8047094 work for barack obama as hard as you did for me
8047095 i dont know him from this election i know him from before this election i met him at the black caucus and i feel that hes really genuine in the fact of his new idea of this politics and its a new wave

8047098 these ssh keys are sent to the attackers who then use them to try to compromise other sites and other systems of interest at the attacked site
8047099 to use the keys with passphrases or passwords to reduce the risk if a key is compromised
8047100 the breach list however doesnt reveal exactly how many records were compromised
8047101 they include an increasing number of data breach notification laws increasing enforcement of privacy and data integrity issues by regulators law enforcement and civil plaintiffs attorneys and the ongoing digitization of society where more and more personal identifying information is captured and stored
8047102 that increase is likely due to the development of sql injections which made breaches much easier to do

8047107 his turn at the podium is notable because in 1992 his father then the popular governor of pennsylvania was not allowed to speak because of his opposition to abortion rights
8047108 father the late governor bob casey was denied a speaking role at the 1992 convention because of his opposition to abortion rights
8047109 according to those who actually doled out the 1992 convention speaking slots casey was denied a turn for one simple reason his refusal to endorse the clinton gore ticket

8047120 the bush administration yesterday proposed scaling back protected zones for endangered whales in the atlantic ocean yielding to cargo companies concerns about new speed limits for ships in these areas
8047121 good evening house speaker nancy pelosi in your remarks tonight you talked about barack obama being the man who will take america to a new future heres the question i have to ask for you should senator clinton have called on her supporters to back barack obama already
8047122 even before the convention and even before the complete reconciliation that we need
8047123 the nomination is decided we have a vice president were going to work together and go forward
8047124 but to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
8047125 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
8047126 we are going into the future what did i walk into a time capsule
8047127 saves that network from slapping on a bumper sticker barack obama could cure cancer and theyd figure out a way to frame it as an economic disaster
8047128 im stunned to see karl rove on a news network as an analyst
8047129 a fox news spokesman replied that jons clearly out of touch citing a pew study showing the network has the most balanced audience in cable news 39 percent republicans and 33 percent democrats

8047131 live shot of denver colorado events that took place at the pepsi center there where the denver nuggets of the nba play basketball
8047132 there are press secretaries in the showers even the sauna has been transformed into an office but when its all over the whole massive arena goes back to the denver nuggets
8047133 youre looking at live pictures of the pepsi center here in denver colorado normally the denver nuggets would be playing basketball here not this week the democrats they have their convention inside were inside
8047134 though sen barack obama has sharply criticized commercial bankers for their role in the housing crisis political donations originating from the industry favor him over his rival for the presidency
8047135 through last month bankers have given the illinois democrat 1 9 million this election cycle compared with 1 7 million to sen john mccain r ariz according to data provided by the center for responsive politics
8047136 this is the first time since the center started tracking the data in 1990 that commercial bankers gave more to a democratic presidential nominee than the gop contender even when president clinton was running for a second term in 1996 the trend was also true across the broader financial services industry which gave 22 4 million to sen obama and 19 million to sen mccain
8047137 it is hard to know what conclusions to draw from the numbers but observers agree they do not necessarily mean bankers believe sen obama would be better for their business
8047138 there are always things under discussion but we dont have any such project either about about to happen or about to be announced

8047162 factchecker org sic says it obtained obamas actual birth certificate and that the document was indeed real
8047163 a separate wnd investigation into obamas birth certificate utilizing forgery experts also found the document to be authentic
8047164 discredited some of the claims of internet bloggers such as that the certificate as viewed in a scanned copy released by obamas campaign lacked a raised seal
8047165 revealed methods used by some of the bloggers to determine the document was fake involved forgeries in that a few bloggers added text and images to the certificate scan that werent originally there
8047166 charge leaped from the blogosphere to the mainstream media earlier this week when jerome corsi repeated the claim in an aug 15 interview with steve doocy on fox news
8047167 israel insider is reporting that analysts working separately have determined the birth certificate posted on the daily kos website and later on sen barack obamas fight the smears campaign website is fraudulent and now two different actions have been launched to try and obtain the truth about the presumptive democratic presidential nominees birth

8047170 despite todds criticism in august 25 interviews with house speaker nancy pelosi sen charles schumer president jimmy carter and robert gibbs 18 of the 20 questions nbc and msnbc correspondents and anchors asked dealt with clinton her supporters or former president bill clinton

8047174 savannah guthrie there with chuck schumer the senator from new york talking up hillarys role in this of course it is going to be the story of the week no matter what we say will the clintons get aboard will they be invited aboard with all the right protocols
8047175 why did we waste all of our time with that
8047176 should senator clinton have called on her supporters to back barack obama already
8047177 h as she clinton hurt barack obama given what the polls are looking like why not
8047178 i ts three months until the election madame speaker and what we have is you talked about 20 percent there are a lot of disgruntled some of them actually angry supporters of hillary clinton
8047179 what do you say to hillary supporters who are now being wooed by john mccain
8047180 hillary speaks tomorrow night president clinton speaks on wednesday night what do the clintons want and what role do you think they the clintons will play
8047181 i have to ask you first of all about that other senator from new york a lot has been said and written about lingering division in the party do you see that in your delegation
8047182 is there some aspect to this that hillary herself has not been able to control i mean there are people who clearly feel strongly about it and no matter what her signals are want to make a stand
8047183 what do you think her role in the senate will be now is she going to be the lioness of the senate in the mold of ted kennedy
8047184 do you think that she hillary clinton should have thrown her support and asked her supporters to go to obama before now
8047185 have you spoken to the clintons have you asked them to have a certain kind of message in other words have you tried to guide what theyre going to do here
8047186 h ave you called to talk to them about what they need to do here
8047187 when are we going to see a real coming together of bill clinton the former president and the democratic nominee for president barack obama when will we see them in the same picture together having lunch together hanging out together in a friendly environment when will that happen
8047188 i havent seen a picture yet of bill clinton with barack obama when will i see them together
8047189 mr gibbs whats the best case scenario what do you see as the best case scenario of these conversations if we dont call them negotiations between you and those supporters sort of running whats left of the clinton campaign as we wait for the kennedy thing tonight
8047190 do you expect bill clinton to barnstorm his way through those areas where he did well southern white guys if you will in the appalachian area states that can be tricky portions of ohio portions of pennsylvania are you going to really surgically use bill the way for example eddie rendell the governor of pennsylvania was able to call in air strikes by the clintons
8047191 why did we waste all of our time with that
8047192 ok we will support gerald ford as a last choice
8047193 ill get back to you ill get some staff to get you that answer
8047194 we are honoured to give inter coach jose mourinho his italian baptism
8047195 weve seen the nerazzuri in the supercoppa they have proven to be a battleship we will tackle them with great respect
8047196 it sampdorias transfer market is closed until january we would only make a move if it allowed us a jump in quality
8047197 paloschi milan could sell him but thats not they direction were going
8047198 honestly it will be something that will generate a lot of attention if enyimba qualify along with al ahly to feature in the final both teams had won the title back to back so if it happens it will really be a wonderful time for african football
8047199 other teams have pedigree too but i can assure you that the ultimate will be a final between nigeria and egypt and that is between enyimba and al ahly there will never be any final like it but lets wait and see
8047200 we are challenged by the fact that we lost some of our best players to injury and transfer while two of our best players including emmanuel ekpo left on transfer to america others like ekene emigo and uche kalu have been sidelined due to injury
8047201 it is something we cannot help but we are devastated over the situation given the fact that they are experienced players that would have assisted in our campaign however i believe other players are committed enough and are ready to give their best
8047202 it is unfortunate that only in this part of the world that players wake up and travel out of the country on trial without respecting the contract they have with their clubs
8047203 from the way we have played you will agree with me that we are focused we have a target and we are working towards it
8047204 we are committing everything to ensure that our objectives are met also remember we missed out in the championship for sometime now coming back means throwing in everything we have into it
8047205 on current form we are the most vibrant team in the championship we won all our matches in the preliminary stage and we also scored in all our away matches i sincerely believe we have a team that will fight till the end
8047206 i do not believe that we have taken a step back in our preparations we have not been as good as we should have been but the opposition also played well and we had five or six chances
8047207 we have lost but we could have drawn or even won the game i am pleased that we have qualified because i have seen a lot of ties like this that have ended up being very close
8047208 we tried to control the match and we didnt want to lose we tried to win we didnt but it was a good performance
8047209 i liked the central partnership in midfield of christian poulsen and claudio marchisio as it was the first time they were playing together
8047210 nedved wasnt happy about the substitution but i have to think about the game in florence its only natural that he wants to play
8047211 finding a difficult balance human rights law enforcement and cyber violence against women
8047212 cybercrime laws are not enough there is also a need for education
8047213 the facility south of atlanta is having problems processing data requiring that all flight plan information be processed through a facility in salt lake city utah the two facilities process all my emphasis flight plans for commercial and general aviation flights in the united states said faa spokeswoman kathleen bergen
8047214 the problem appeared similar to a june 8 2007 computer glitch that caused severe flight delays and some cancellations along the east coast
8047215 we have to get through the group but it wont be at all easy
8047216 there are a number of teams in with a chance to qualify
8047217 hes got experience in this league and a lot to offer
8047218 ive been on a few teams over the last few years and its good to have a good chance like this
8047219 i think it was the best game hes played for this club yet
8047220 i thought he was awesome mvp for our team tonight
8047221 the goalkeeper coach reminded me at halftime not a lot to do tonight but make sure youre ready for the one or two things youll have to do later on in the second half
8047222 i just kept that in the back of my head and tried to show up and fortunately i was able to come through for the team
8047223 sometimes youre more spectacular than other times honestly i was just happy to get the point in the team sense weve been struggling for it with regards to getting results
8047224 just be yourself be a leader and do what you do
8047225 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
8047226 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
8047227 605 000 long term immigrants arriving in the year to mid 2007 the eu projections show that the wave of migration to britain boosting both the workforce and fertility rates is out of step with many other european countries where deaths are expected to overtake births after 2015
8047228 trends differ for the four countries of the uk the population of england is projected to increase by 8 per cent by 2016 that of northern ireland by 7 per cent big year that and wales by 5 per cent the projected increase for scotland where fertility and life expectancy levels are assumed to remain lower than in the rest of the uk is 3 per cent across the united kingdom northern ireland recorded the highest rate of growth with a one per cent population rise last year to 1 8 million people the population of england rose by 0 6 per cent to 51 1 million scotland and wales rose by 0 5 per cent
8047229 the uk population reached 60 5 million this year and the new official figures suggest it will rise to 65 million by 2016 and 71 million by 2031
8047230 the cardinal has not made clear why religion should get a free pass
8047231 at least one blast bomb as well as bottles stones and petrol bombs have been thrown at police investigating a security alert in the tullygally and drumbeg areas of craigavon
8047232 i would appeal to everyone involved in the trouble to stop it now before someone is either injured or killed
8047233 this is not a game this is not fun what weve seen tonight is actually attempted murder please stop it now before someone is killed
8047234 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
8047235 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence
8047236 every four or eight years ireland is forced to rally round young men from this class
8047237 every four or eight years ireland is forced to rally round young men from this class and adopt them as our great national hopes
8047238 this charge of fiddling while rome burns was a problem which heaney discusses in his essay the interesting case of nero chekhovs cognac and a knocker where he recalls how he and david hammond felt unable to record a tape of songs against the immediate backdrop of explosions in belfast
8047239 we aimed to challenge sectarian divisions in the north of ireland to put
8047240 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border
8047241 the singers house by seamus heaney to david hammond people here used to believe that drowned souls lived in seals at spring tides they might change shape they loved music and swam in for a singer who might stand at the end of summer in the mouth of a whitewashed turf shed his shoulder to the jamb his song a rowboat far out in evening when i came here first you were always singing a hint of the clip of the pick in your winnowing climb and attack raise it again man we still believe what we hear
8047242 its very clear we need to deliver any agreements that weve had with the dup and the two governments the devolution of policing and justice has to happen we in our party have worked for years and are very committed to the process under way but we need to start seeing results
8047243 the oireachtas could ratify lisbon subject to a number of opt outs if necessary for example the charter of fundamental rights the solidarity clause transfer of certain matters to qualified majority voting and the inclusion of new competences such as energy security climate change and tourism
8047244 mep mary lou mcdonald has said if the irish government secures a better deal for ireland at european level only then is there an argument for a new referendum those of us on the no side want specific new additional points in the treaty and we want specific cast iron legal views on taxation she said
8047245 a succession of anti family anti life and other anti christian decisions by brussels has made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive support for europe in the lisbon referendum
8047246 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
8047247 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
8047248 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
8047249 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
8047250 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
8047251 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
8047252 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
8047253 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
8047254 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
8047255 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt
8047256 as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business
8047257 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
8047258 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
8047259 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex here in beijing organisers have realised that such prohibitions are about as useful as banning breathing and have instead handed out thousands of free condoms to the athletes if you cant stop em at least make it safe
8047260 superstar david beckham kicked off the countdown to the london olympics and revealed he could be a coach for team gb in 2012 becks sent 91 000 spectators into a frenzy at beijings national stadium when he appeared from within a red london bus at yesterdays closing ceremony
8047261 rania wannous spokeswoman for visit london said the issue has been
8047262 this is a three minute film that is a few years old it has been used at many events before and we have never had any complaints
8047263 reinforcing what everyone thinks they know about the place this was brand marketing at its most effective
8047264 johnson amp johnson has been waiting until after the beijing games close today before making a statement when it is expected to say that it is cutting its involvement lenovo the chinese computer company like manulife sees no gain from a link with the london games kodak has been involved with the olympics since their revival in 1896 but its chief executive antonio perez said its sponsorship was no longer the best use of the companys money
8047265 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
8047266 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
8047267 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
8047268 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
8047269 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup
8047270 martin mcguinness is on holiday and sinn fein has no interest in responding to demands by reg empey
8047271 the criminal cases review commission recommended that his case go back to the court of appeal which this summer cleared him
8047272 aided and abetted by secret sects satanic groups and new age movements
8047273 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
8047274 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
8047275 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
8047276 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
8047277 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too
8047278 the psni as a political statement and thus they judge the psnis success not by its effectiveness but by its existence and that sad to say makes the psni the latest in a long line of political police forces here
8047279 the cardinal has not made clear why religion should get a free pass
8047280 nous allons pr senter une quinzaine de projets environnementaux aidant la r duction de carbone

8047284 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
8047285 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
8047286 we are keeping up on your path fadel as you lay in rest
8047287 the blood of fadel shanaa will be the fuel for other cameramen and journalists to continue to convey the message to continue to report the truth to the outside world we wont be hindered or hampered by israeli actions we ask and seek the support of the united nations human rights groups and world news outlets so the killers of shanaa can be brought to justice
8047288 the killers of shanaa must be punished the blood of shanaa and that of the eight children must not be wasted
8047289 the israeli soldiers intentionally killed this journalist as he was not in a place of danger he was wearing a vest marked with the word press on it he was filming about 750 meters away from the israeli tank but the israeli tank shelled and killed him intentionally in an attempt to blackout an israeli invasion of the middle area of the gaza strip at that particular day
8047290 its a sad day that we had to even come here for the hearing but were pleased by the judges decision finding probable cause for the arrest
8047291 the finger of blame is easy to point and in these cases hard to defend
8047292 and sometimes as we heard today theres a rush to judgment theres actually a substantial absence of information available to the state right now to describe this case
8047293 les scientifiques ont introduit un mod le permettant de pr dire le d but de la saison des pluies et ont estim quau niveau r gional la saison des pluies commence trente jours plus tard compar la situation dil y a quarante ans

8047295 like any business weve retooled our product to meet the needs of our customers and our communities the goal is to make our business coverage more local and more focused on the small businesses that make vermonts economy run
8047296 according to the vermont economy newsletter only 2 percent of the states businesses are large those with 50 or more employees that means entrepreneurs like ken bogdanowicz of sound toys inc featured on page 4 employ the vast majority of vermonts work force
8047297 we hope to introduce you to as many small business owners as we can and share their uniquely vermont strategies for success at the same time we wont forget the contribution of the states major employers most of which reside in chittenden county
8047298 youll find the content more people oriented weve introduced a feature in which we invite some of the states prominent business and public leaders to share the best advice i ever got sen patrick leahy kicks off the series today with a look at how the states farm community convinced him that diversification and the introduction of organic farming methods was key to preserving vermonts family farms he listened despite finding little support in congress for an idea that was ahead of its time
8047299 among the new speakers announced today are senate republican leader mitch mcconnell ky house republican leader john boehner ohio u s sen lindsey graham s c u s sen kay bailey hutchison texas former u s sen bill frist tenn and chairman of the texas railroad commission michael williams their remarks will echo the themes that have been selected for each of the convention s four days service reform prosperity and peace
8047300 among the new speakers announced today are senate republican leader mitch mcconnell ky house republican leader john boehner ohio u s sen lindsey graham s c u s sen kay bailey hutchison texas four lost years
8047301 gpgs portfolio has not been immune from the worldwide sharemarket shakeout and to that extent we believe most of those losses will be recovered and more
8047302 the majority of gpgs investments are sound strategic long term holdings where we are confident of intrinsic value regardless of share price fluctuations
8047303 arguably misplaced investment judgement where prospects of recovery were more remote and where cost exceed ed market value
8047304 however we are now supporting yet another equity issue in the hope expectation that the inevitable changes in the companys trading environment are looming ever closer and our faith will be finally rewarded
8047305 they are really taking a very important leadership role and setting a very high example for others to follow
8047306 the big risk for us of course is that they may say gee were just not going to give any money to stanford
8047307 we want to be sure were not contributing to the marketing of products
8047308 companies have taken steps to separate the grant making process for educational programs from their marketing efforts according to a statement issued by the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america which represents many large drug and biotechnology companies
8047309 it was a good feeling to see beltre hit that ball
8047310 hes hit in bad luck all year and hit two line drives tonight that were caught
8047311 fluor has a long history of executing some of the most complex projects in the most challenging regions of the world
8047312 we will continue to serve the needs of our clients in the region expand our resource base and work with the local community in anchorage and throughout alaska
8047313 turnouts looking a little light at most of our polling places so i think we might end up closer to 30 percent turnout than 40 percent
8047314 we could still come in at 40 if things pick up toward the end of the day but its looking a little quieter than we wish but then anything less than 100 percent is quieter than we wish
8047315 we sent a generator up there but by the time it got there the electricity was back
8047316 this movement represents a small movement in net outflows combined with an unfavourable decline in the market value of equities over this period
8047317 whats frustrating is that i have four kids ages 3 to 8 and i had to explain to them this morning what this was all about and i wasnt ready to have sex education at the breakfast table
8047318 the law recognizes a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
8047319 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
8047320 if youre talking about a true threat there has to be some evidence theyre not just talking about it or thinking about it especially in a drug induced state
8047321 ive felt welcomed since the moment i got off the plane
8047322 weve gone to cherry creek mall weve done the jazz festival in five points
8047323 there are not a lot of very pedestrian friendly cities in the united states and i really think were going to claim our own place in this regard
8047324 we were so far out from the convention center in los angeles that i didnt like that very well and we had to travel so far
8047325 i like the fact that our housing is downtown because i like to shop
8047326 people are much friendly people are more accessible the streets the shops the folks are really helpful so ive had a great time so far and im looking forward to having a couple more days of it
8047327 i talked to my son today and i said our next trip is to denver
8047328 i think if you havent been to denver in a year you havent been to denver because it has changed so much
8047329 were going to educate a lot of people across the world about what there is to see and do in denver we hope they come back and do some business with and we also hope theyll bring their conventions and come back as a tourist
8047330 we cant take easy route to union station back to invesco field
8047331 you take c line to osage and take ef or h line or fhd line to downtown or vice versa
8047332 the first thought was we couldnt do it and we proved to ourselves we could
8047333 it was busy we had a lot of bikes in here so i think that was smart decision
8047334 when have five people standing around waiting for something to happen it can be frustrating
8047335 what about lil kim she played her position in the back
8047336 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr please respect his familys grief and privacy at this time
8047337 this would be the most amazing thing that can happen
8047338 i believe that the extraordinary technology that we now have merits the use of instant replay on a very limited basis
8047339 the system we have in place will ensure that the proper call is made on home run balls and will not cause a significant delay to the game
8047340 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
8047341 i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8047342 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8047343 i just know that with this convention this is going to be the unleashing of women power
8047344 you have to know more about every subject than they do
8047345 i learned that i can make a difference and that i can be the voice that is hidden inside people
8047346 i do agree that there is not enough diversity at the table of politics in our country
8047347 check your departure airport to see if your flight may be affected
8047348 it could be any location because one facility is now processing flight data for everybody
8047349 there are cancelations due to weather from the hurricane but not due to this
8047350 were not going to let an unsafe condition exist its just going to be slower
8047351 es un gran honor ser parte del congreso nacional del senado por decisi n de la soberan a popular estamos ac para servir a la rep blica a la gobernabilidad sin odio para trabajar por nuestro pueblo sin odio ni rencores
8047352 aqu se ha cumplido el mandato de los organismos jurisdiccionales competentes del tribunal de justicia electoral de la corte suprema
8047353 es un proceso que en cierta manera ven a debilitando m s que al congreso al propio presidente de la rep blica
8047354 la constituci n es clara dice el que fue presidente de la rep blica debe ser senador vitalicio
8047355 la p 51 ser bautizada en octubre en una ceremonia en la que participar el presidente brasile o luiz in cio lula da silva y ese mismo mes ser trasladada a la cuenca marina de campos

8047359 it has been an extremely difficult decision to make given my burning desire to represent europe again in defending the ryder cup in the united states
8047360 and hope that my performance so far this year will earn one of his two wild card picks
8047361 thats a lot of movement as it relates to us and our field size
8047362 one day they came in and said you have to be out in two weeks
8047363 so then we had to shut down and we didnt have time to give our customers notice
8047364 and now we have construction out here which is awful
8047365 we could have stayed open during it while 93 was being expanded behind us but at the same time there was a need for us to renovate our building
8047366 f r das jahr 2008 ist mit bis 40 h heren heizkosten zu rechnen
8047367 das sind 43 cent mehr pro quadratmeter bei gleichen vorauszahlungen m ssen mieter mit massiven nachzahlungen rechnen
8047368 although downside risks to growth remained they appeared to have diminished somewhat and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectation increased
8047369 with the exception of when hes on a lot of drugs
8047370 i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy
8047371 yeah my dad can be that guy but its not all of him
8047372 so this is more like a talking book a really thorough autobiography
8047373 my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius in my opinion
8047374 he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that
8047375 for the most part generally hes more often than not not a complete idiot most of the time
8047376 oh that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory that your hand be with me that you would keep me from evil that i may not cause pain
8047377 our only intention was to track our own flights it accidentally turned into a site
8047378 we wanted to develop some fancy heuristics for predicting delays
8047379 i can click on yzd and if a global 5000 files a flight plan i can catch them on camera departing yzd
8047380 i have a friend that owns a cessna 421 in torrance california so i have it on flightaware flight alert when ever the aircraft files a flight plan departs or lands on the flight plan i get an email flight alert
8047381 the aviation community as disparate as it is is pretty tight
8047382 everyone has gone through the same training and the same lessons
8047383 i literally have friends involved in aviation all over the world

8047420 the problem was that the gould report did not say what support structure should be in place for the chief returning officer or describe the role
8047421 this could be a complex and cumbersome management response which deals with the symptoms rather than offering a clear and democratic solution
8047422 i have doubts over whether such a large new quango is needed the proposals are uncosted and likely to lead to an unnecessarily unwieldy reorganisation
8047423 weve always run great city programs but since the park redevelopment weve seen a boost in community turnout with this new facility we were able to add a master swim program more aquatic exercise classes and even host birthday parties
8047424 right now we are in the middle of an entire modernization program and gap really sets the tone for this movement the strength of the aquatics park is that it gives everyone from one year old to 90 years old the opportunity to use this facility
8047425 this facility brings a huge draw to the area weve had people come from as far as chico bringing in all these visitors provides us an opportunity to support our economic development which is so important right now
8047426 we worked collaboratively and imaginatively to create a sustainable well designed user friendly aquatic center and park space for this community
8047427 we will see what legislation the snp come forward with
8047428 i am not intuitively against making sure that people have a choice and an opportunity to cast a vote on these things but i believe it should be a strengthened scotland within the uk
8047429 we had wobbly wendy and now we have twisting tavish tavish scott was previously known for his hardline opposition to a referendum and now we look forward to him upholding liberal democrat principles and supporting the scottish governments referendum bill in 2010
8047430 we congratulate tavish on his election as the lib dem leader he will have a tough job as he takes over the reins of scotlands fourth party especially since scottish politics is now a three horse race
8047431 can i thank the party for this the gold medal of the liberal democrats olympics
8047432 after less than 18 months in government the snp is riding high in the polls theyre popular but heres my prediction by 2010 they will not be
8047433 we can already see the underlying weakness that will undo alex salmond what looks confident sure footed and wise today will be seen as arrogant misguided and politically dishonest tomorrow
8047434 spin is the hallmark of this government but spin has a shelf life
8047435 tavish will address the issues that matter most to the people of scotland not the narrow minded squabbles of the nationalists and labour
8047436 gata acum presiunea s a transferat la ei nu mai e la mine
8047437 nu va fi u or meciul pentru c nt lnim o echip cu juc tori valoro i cu experien bogat n cupele europene dar m bazez n primul r nd pe reac ia juc torilor mei i pe faptul c au trecut ca i grup de mai multe ori prin asemenea meciuri i totul a ie it cum trebuie presiunea pentru turci trebuie s vin din teren i apoi dinspre tribune

8047442 cei inteligen i merg mai departe iar noi cred c suntem mai de tep i turcii sunt mai devota i dar noi juc m mai inteligent
8047443 o calificare n grupe ar fi cea mai mare performan din cariera mea ar fi meritul at tor ani de munc presta i de mine dar i de stafful pe care l am
8047444 dac nu e ti pe deplin recuperat dar i asumi responsabilitatea atunci c nd intri pe teren atunci trebuie s dai totul din tine
8047445 ne u nu a semnat cu nimeni e sub contract cu steaua a a c trebuie s i fac datoria aici i apoi vom vedea ce se va nt mpla
8047446 zapata a avut unele interven ii neinspirate n anumite meciuri dar asta nu nseamn c nu va fi acum concentrat i nu i va ajuta echipa de asta e n poart de asta avem ncredere n el
8047447 nu cred c juc torii se g ndesc mai nt i la bani i apoi la participarea n lig to i i ar dori s ajung acolo practic acolo e fotbalul adev rat
8047448 nu cred c steaua joac s apere un rezultat indiferent c e baraj sau campionat steaua trebuie s joace ce vrea ea ce i dore te i n func ie de rezultat s nu le permit adversarilor s joace ce vor ei
8047449 suntem mult mai bine preg ti i fa de meciul de la istanbul i am venit aici s ne calific m

8047458 i believe that hillary is too intelligent a politician to leave herself vulnerable to the charge that she failed to do everything she could to get sen obama elected
8047459 i believe hillary got a raw deal from the get go
8047460 anything she said the national media put a negative connotation on it
8047461 contrairement une id e re ue les talibans ont une meilleure compr hension de ce qui est strat giquement important ils ont compris que le centre de gravit du conflit est la sensibilit de lopinion occidentale quil faut frapper en tuant des soldats de lotan de pr f rence am ricains notre refus dencaisser les pertes est notoire

8047467 the main issue for creating a finance industry in israel is that today foreign investors or private equity firms who want to manage funds and foreign money in israel will be taxed on capital gains except for direct investments into local companies and venture capital technology based investments
8047468 to create a local private equity industry attracting global fund managers and foreign investors we recommend to the committee to adopt a capital gains tax exemption for private equity investments and hedge funds similar to the us model for non us citizens
8047469 tax exemption should apply to new business generated inside and outside of israel to encourage business in israel
8047470 this is a good time to bring back israelis and encourage aliya of top tier finance professionals and investment managers when around the world finance professionals are being laid off we are getting five to 10 calls a week from finance professionals overseas looking to come here
8047471 we have to develop our own model and build up a sophisticated and advanced capital market with the aim of creating a financial center in the middle east
8047472 global financial market means different things to different markets and its definition is not more than playing with words
8047473 those who are judging the feasibility of the vision of the ariav committee on whether israel can become a financial center akin to london or singapore are just missing the point
8047474 london isnt new york and new york isnt london the government does not and should not make the decision over what defines a financial market the exact definition of what constitutes a financial center will be dictated by the market
8047475 what is needed is a structure to attract talent to israel
8047476 there is a lot of talent portfolio managers who want to be in israel but couldnt because of the volumes of capital
8047477 our company is an example that this is starting to happen we have been able to attract a number of investment professionals immigrants and returning israelis from top tier international investment firms which if we were in london or new york we would have not been able to get
8047478 our first choice was to live in israel and then we looked at what we could do here
8047479 a couple of years ago the feasibility of running a hedge fund out of tel aviv would have been just a vision
8047480 our work shows that sophisticated clients who have access to investment managers in london and new york are choosing to have money managed by a firm in tel aviv a sign that israel is already exporting financial services

8047501 o melhor local para a abertura da copa o morumbi no caso do palmeiras o que queremos colocar o est dio como uma das sub sedes at porque a capacidade aproximada do est dio ser de 40 mil lugares

8047524 more than doubles the performance of its predecessor the 8400gs thanks in part to 65 nm process technology and a 128 bit memory bus board partners are free to go beyond these specs however already weve seen a handful of partners clocking their boards at higher memory speeds than 400mhz while most seem to be sticking with the stock speeds for the graphics core and shaders the gpu has a 50w tdp with a max gpu temp of 105 degrees celsius and ships with a single slot cooler and 6 6
8047525 if we are to avert the most significant effects of climate change we cant just talk about the weather we have to do something
8047526 its typical of the government where they have gone berserk with this sort of stuff
8047527 its not a feminist takeover its a lesbian takeover in wellington
8047528 theres hardly a government head thats not a lesbian so many lesbians are in top jobs and they dont want to acknowledge any sex its a neutralisation of sex instead of saying foreman or forewoman
8047529 we dont think any organisms belong in the amniotic sac
8047530 eu acho que essa sul americana devia valer vaga para a libertadores agora n s vamos usar para lan ar os jogadores jovens para ver como eles se portam para ver quem quem essa a filosofia do clube
8047531 importante dar confian a a eles n o d para pegar entrosamento mas pelo menos um padr o t tico n o deve haver cobran a porque eles n o est o jogando para isso e sim para apresentar seu futuro e nem press o porque eles t m que jogar vontade
8047532 um jogo que n s temos interesse mas a prioridade outra a sul americana tira o foco do time a gente tem que respeitar porque um direito que o clube conquistou mas neste momento ela vai atrapalhar
8047533 desde que cheguei quarta e domingo quarta e domingo n o d tempo de fazer jogadas ensaiadas
8047534 eu gosto de obst culos e estou mostrando isto as dificuldades fazem parte
8047535 eu me inspiro em grandes pessoas que conseguiram medalhas ol mpicas com mais idade
8047536 falava que ela tinha perdido os tr s melhores anos dela mas isto s valorizou mais todo o seu drama
8047537 a nossa expectativa que ela salte ainda mais longe o ouro veio com 7 04m que volte a saltar 7 26m principalmente em competi es de ponta
8047538 queremos muito o t tulo da copa sul americana para coroar a dedica o deste grupo mas claro que tamb m n o podemos deixar de focar no campeonato brasileiro vamos voltar a pensar no brasileir o depois deste jogo
8047539 temos que fazer o nosso jogo que o de atacar sempre em busca de gols em nenhum momento mesmo quando abre vantagem o botafogo joga recuado esperando o advers rio em seu campo justamente por isso n o devemos mudar as nossas caracter sticas num momento decisivo
8047540 tomara que a goleada sobre o atl tico pr signifique uma arrancada na temporada queremos n o s subir na tabela do brasileiro como tamb m avan ar na sul americana vamos buscar mais um resultado positivo diante do botafogo
8047541 o brasil est atrasado h mais de um ano levantamos a situa o dos est dios brasileiros e n o h um em condi es ideais para receber a copa at o engenh o que um est dio novo e moderno est localizado em um local totalmente deteriorado uma p rola em meio a um mangue

8047543 um ensaio bem feito todo ano na capital mas precisamos disso em mbito nacional

8047545 people have sort of absorbed all the bad news there is so far and theyre anticipating a turnaround next year
8047546 everybody will be surprised if it ends up being a good holiday season
8047547 the crises ahead are increasing both in complexity and frequency yet levels of crises readiness among organizations remains low and poorly understood
8047548 so far i think we have not seen the kind of political reconciliation thats going to bring about longterm stability in iraq
8047549 but the same factors that led me to oppose the surge still hold true the strain on our military has grown the situation in afghanistan has deteriorated and weve spent nearly 200 billion more in iraq than we had budgeted iraqs leaders have failed to invest tens of billions of dollars in oil revenues in rebuilding their own country and they have not reached the political accommodation that was the stated purpose of the surge
8047550 really the safest thing you can do is make all your food at home from scratch period
8047551 sometimes we buy the product anyway and sometimes we dont
8047552 what does this really mean can i count on it as a consumer to really have any meaning
8047553 advisory labeling may not be protecting the health of allergic consumers
8047554 not suitable for consumption by persons with an allergy to x
8047555 maybe illustrates how difficult it can be when you have food allergies to stay on top of that information

8047557 i am a 36 year old african american woman i have two girls ages 10 and 8 the country does not get the full import of this moment my daughters and i sat together along with my husband to watch michelle obama tonight mr sullivan we were all in tears this is a day that cannot be fully described this country has systematically oppressed black women for centuries my ancestors were slaves and my great great great grandmothers raped and treated as property my daughters have very few black women to look up to in popular culture as role models they do not feel seen they are not held up as the standards of american beauty we shed tears tonight as a family because michelle with her elegance and grace is holding all of us up with her you dont understand the burden that she bears
8047558 i was dumbfounded when the doctor told me i have late stage colon cancer
8047559 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8047560 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8047561 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8047562 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8047563 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8047564 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8047565 the next president must bring to office a clear eyed view of our nations role in the world as the defender of the oppressed and a force for peace
8047566 well theres no such thing as race thats been scientifically demonstrated
8047567 mirrodin has a card that we turned into a legend mostly just because we couldnt figure out what would happen if there were two of them in play at the same time
8047568 if we win ill go down as having the lowest iq of any genius who ever lived
8047569 im really happy that i dont have to pick four players this morning i can tell you that
8047570 it would have been very difficult to know what to do
8047571 im looking for the hottest players but they dont play for the united states
8047572 so i can look at the top 12 guys and maybe make a choice just based on that
8047573 i dont know if you look down that list i like the next four guys a lot

8047631 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8047632 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8047633 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8047705 as a couple with two young children we were becoming increasingly concerned about our impact on the environment and we started to look actively at how we could reduce our own carbon footprint like many families up and down the country we realised there are no easy answers and you cant suddenly become green overnight the philosophy we adopted was to think big and act small both my wife and i work in an office environment and we noticed that we are always using search engines and thats where the idea for click4carbon came from
8047706 the principle behind click4carbon is to offer users one simple means of reducing their footprint through an everyday activity that they already do we are not trying to reinvent the wheel google is by far the most popular search engine in the world all that we want to do is provide users with that same experience but with a different goal in mind click4carbon is our way of trying to make a difference

8047786 if my documentary achieves anything i hope it captures the larrikin spirit and energy that infused the films of that era
8047787 the first movie is all about the mystery and reveal of the transformers as a concept and a species which means we had to hide them a lot in the first hour
8047788 in the second movie now that everyone believes in the universe we can jump right into the world of the transformers
8047789 we got away with a lot in the first movie because for a long time no one thought it would work or that it was just a silly cartoon and simply proving that wrong is all we had to do
8047790 the first movie was meant to be somewhat of a mystery for the sequel we need an entirely different structure and paradigm for the movie and we cant rely on it being the first
8047791 lets respond to this with warm and grateful hearts folks im saddened but will keep my eyes open for another space to do this if not the familiar one on dundas thank you all for the support youve given the series over the years ill miss the little oasis the series became for me

8047802 the current zone only taxes lorries which are a minor part of the pollution problem in central london
8047803 our view is that the environmental savings are not proportional to the cost to businesses and we would be concerned that this would be the case with any extensions to the zone
8047804 it seems astounding that the place behind one of britains greatest ever achievements cannot be saved and memorialised
8047805 to me it is equivalent to letting nelsons column fall down or wellingtons victory arch crumble to dust an outrage to think we have not the will nor the historical understanding to save it

8047819 diving is a spectator sport i think people like the theatrical component to it and recognize the talent involved

8047821 toronto does not have a global facility that divers can train and compete in

8047856 the governor believes californians ought have the opportunity to vote on these four measures on the november ballot despite the fact that the legislature is two months past their deadline in passing a budget
8047857 the former president speaking in denver posed a hypothetical question in which he seemed to suggest that that the democratic party was making a mistake in choosing obama as its presidential nominee
8047858 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8047859 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8047860 two four six eight cant get a budget in this state
8047861 i cannot survive on 6 55 no way were underpaid as it is
8047862 they knew this was coming this happens every single year but this year hes taking it to an extreme
8047863 were in bargaining right now and we want to get a good contract
8047864 we havent had consistent raises in the last seven years so we fell behind
8047865 the governor has done everything he can do here the legislature is over two months late in doing their job of passing a budget
8047866 its the legislature both republicans and democrats who have refused to come out of their corners neither side is compromising and doing the responsible thing by proposing a bipartisan solution the govenror can sign
8047867 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here and nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
8047868 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
8047869 there is a new wave of change all around us and if we set our compass through we will reach our destination
8047870 the governor believes californians ought have the opportunity to vote on these four measures on the november ballot despite the fact that the legislature is two months past their deadline in passing a budget
8047871 the governor remains committed that he is not going to sign any bills until we have a budget
8047872 however these four measures need to get on the november ballot and he does not believe simply because the legislature has failed to do their job that californians should not have the opportunity to vote on these measures
8047873 i am so glad that i found trivita as a strong business model to follow their idea of buying customers maps instead of the usual way of conducting a network marketing business by buying leads has produced such a rich roi that i cannot see myself pursuing any online business in another way
8047874 trivita is not just another home business deal it is a real way to improve your business profitability the roi on money invested will become much more substantial if one follows the guidelines set forth by trivita and consistently buy customers each month
8047875 even though john edwards is not coming to the democratic national convention here in denver its not like hes been completely forgotten

8047884 while press reports have made clear that freddie is having little success raising private capital it does not seem to be having any difficulty attracting investors in
8047885 it pushed the euro lower the consensus was that the european central bank will lower interest rates so overall we had a stronger us dollar
8047886 all weve done is pull back some of the initial strength of the us dollar
8047887 the bottom of the housing downturn is coming into view
8047888 we need to see more of the same kind of reports over the next few months showing increasing affordability and a reduction in inventory
8047889 its therapeutic that these foreclosed properties are being sold off at deep discounts
8047890 theres no question people are getting values today better than they could have dreamed of getting two years ago
8047891 we felt that was the way the market was going
8047892 were starting to see some of things we need to form a bottom in the next six to 12 months
8047893 the man mccain so admires george w bush shows just how out of touch it is with the needs of u s voters last night leach broke with the gop to endorse barack obama during the democratic national convention he said in part
8047894 let us not look backward in anger or forward in fear but around in awareness
8047895 let us not look backward in anger or forward in fear but around in awareness
8047896 its very very very easy for someone to convince you to go through their computer
8047897 a lot of people wouldnt even know theyve been attacked
8047898 a black delegate for hillary rodham clinton says she was called an uncle tom by illinois senate president emil jones one of barack obamas political mentors
8047899 some theologians to speculate that specifically human life capable of receiving an immortal soul may not exist until a few weeks into pregnancy while in canon law these theories led to a distinction in penalties between very early and later abortions the churchs moral teaching never justified or permitted abortion at any stage of development
8047900 agrees with the church that we should reduce the number of abortions
8047901 are wrong i do agree with him if you believe that you will benefit from the advertisement do click but not for the only solely purpose tipping the blog owner
8047902 we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like and we have to close those gaps until the world as it is and the world as it should be are one and the same
8047903 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8047904 now the oil companies are placing their bets on john mccain bankrolling his campaign and gambling with our future
8047905 explains why he wants to give another 4 billion tax break to oil companies
8047906 shame on you barack obama enough with the speeches and the big rallies and then using tactics that are right out of karl roves playbook
8047907 senator obama holds up his original opposition to the war on the campaign trail but he didnt start working aggressively to end the war until he started running for president so when he had a chance to act on his speech he chose silence instead
8047908 last summer he basically threatened to bomb pakistan which i dont think was a particularly wise position to take
8047909 so you decide which makes more sense entrust our country to someone who is ready on day one or to put america in the hands of someone with little national or international experience who started running for president the day he arrived in the u s senate
8047910 well you know senator obama it is very difficult having a straight up debate with you because you never take responsibility for any vote and that has been a pattern
8047911 if we dont have universal health care we will be betraying the democratic partys principles sen obamas plan does not and cannot cover all americans
8047912 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
8047913 each year we will try to upgrade the schedule and this year is no different
8047914 having the opportunity to play both the sec and big ten champion will challenge our team early in the season playing exempt tournaments and neutral site games are all part of our scheduling philosophy i want to know who we are and where we need to go
8047915 only playing 14 home games is a concern for me but is something we just have to deal with i think this schedule is challenging and fair
8047916 people talk about unbalanced schedules but when you get into league play there is no unbalanced schedule because every single game is an event and you need to play at a very high level to have a chance to win
8047917 the greenhouses were amongst the hills just driving by or walking by on the road you wouldnt see the greenhouses you would have to walk the property line or see it by air
8047918 this marijuana grow operation is the largest property grow op i have been to
8047919 for somebody to distribute that amount of marijuana without organized crime connection would be i think near impossible
8047920 well if theyre prepared to spend hours and hours in the wind tunnel if they are prepared to invent new bicycle equipment and push the laws of bike design to the very limit if they are studying nutrition and training techniques to maximise every possible advantage whats to say theyre not doping or tampering with their blood
8047921 if they ate deli meat or they think they might have eaten maple leaf deli meat and theyre not ill right now theres no tests anyone can do to tell if theyre going to come down with the illness or not
8047922 in canada we have a pretty good food safety system and meat safety system we would consider that for the vast majority of meats they would be safe to eat
8047923 if we try to ban absolutely every food or substance that has a potential for carrying contamination bacteria or viruses there wouldnt be much left for people to eat
8047924 there is insufficient evidence that there was any kind of a plot or a threat but well keep an open mind as we look
8047925 the new school year also means that research via wikipedia is going to be on the rise

8047970 so a child who is an infant has one certain type of immune system that changes where if they receive vaccines as an infant that immune system is strong that over time can wane it can decrease so by the time they are 10 or 11 years old in the sixth or seventh grade that immunity may decrease and that may be a time they may need to be boosted
8047971 some of the outbreaks last week that were reported it was clear in the data that was presented that a lot of that was due to the fact that parents were holding back on giving their children the first or the second measles shot
8047972 so again clear evidence that there is a problem when we hold back on the vaccines and we start seeing outbreaks so is it fair to really put everybody at risk i would argue that it is not
8047973 in front of the elementary weve had them as high as 60 to 65
8047974 when you see the season it was important to these guys and the things that are going on in the show that they get in touch with where they came from

8047993 the documents suggest that the public relations push for war came before the intelligence analysis
8047994 the united states invaded iraq based on false premises the administration orchestrated a public relations drive to prove that iraq had weapons of mass destruction and connections to the 9 11 terrorists both proved false
8047995 whereas the efforts of international weapons inspectors united states intelligence agencies and iraqi defectors led to the discovery that iraq had large stockpiles of chemical weapons and a large scale biological weapons program and that iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program that was much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than intelligence reporting had previously indicated
8047996 to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability
8047997 beginning in may 2004 isg recovered a series of chemical weapons from coalition military units and other sources a total of 53 munitions have been recovered
8047998 initially saddam chose to conceal his nuclear program in its entirety as he did with iraqs bw biological warfare program aggressive un inspections after desert storm forced saddam to admit the existence of the program and destroy or surrender components of the program in the wake of desert storm iraq took steps to conceal key elements of its program and preserve what it could of the professional capabilities of its nuclear scientific community
8047999 many locations associated with previous wmd programs and sites under monitoring by the united nations have been completely looted often there is nothing but a concrete slab at locations where once stood plants or laboratories
8048000 we cannot express a firm view on the possibility that wmd elements were relocated out of iraq prior to the war
8048001 isg technical experts fully evaluated less than one quarter of one percent of the over 10 000 weapons caches throughout iraq
8048002 saddam wanted to end sanctions while preserving the capability to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction when sanctions were lifted
8048003 members of al qaida an organization bearing responsibility for the attacks are known to be in iraq
8048004 attacks underscored the gravity of the threat posed by the acquisition of wmd by international terrorist organizations
8048005 necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations including those who planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001
8048006 pre war administration statements that iraq provided safe haven for abu musab al zarqawi and other terrorist members were substantiated by the intelligence assessments
8048007 postwar information supports prewar assessments and statements that abu musab al zarqawi was in baghdad and that was present in northern iraq
8048008 one of the reported contacts between iraq and before the war has been confirmed and two other meetings have since been identified
8048009 a sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to draw inferences
8048010 that iraq provided material support to bin laden and al qaeda iraq collaborated in or supported bin laden al qaedas terrorist acts of september 11 iraq provided materiel support to al qaeda and that it did so with knowledge and intent to further al qaedas criminal acts
8048011 iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national security of the united states and international peace and security in the persian gulf region and remains in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by among other things continuing to possess and develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability and supporting and harboring terrorist organizations

8048015 america is a very rich nation it will take a lot to bring her down
8048016 the cia feared that a trial would not just reveal the tinners relationship with the united states and perhaps raise questions about american dealings with atomic smugglers but would also imperil efforts to recruit new spies at a time of grave concern over irans nuclear program

8048115 a lot of young people are not aware of these stereotypes and don t even think they re offensive
8048116 what s becoming quite apparent is that the way you actually have an impact on health development and poverty alleviation is when people adopt certain behaviours
8048117 it s just a matter of getting them to understand that what is a long established habit is in fact harmful and that you can do something about it
8048118 we actually use shame we go into communities and say to people do you realise how fecally contaminated your community is
8048119 we do walks of shame where you take a group of people and you walk around and you say look here s some human faeces here and somebody else has had a shit there and you do this community mapping where everybody comes and says where they defecate
8048120 and you get them to realise how disgusting this is to live in an environment that is totally contaminated
8048121 and once they start using a toilet even if it s just a pit latrine they refuse to go back to open defecation so they begin to climb the sanitation ladder
8048122 families were spending money on treating diarrhoea and other diseases but would not spend money on installing a toilet because they expected to be given money for that by aid groups

8048146 iedereen vraagt om een hoeveel gelijktijdige kijkers zullen we moeten bedienen voor welke bandbreedte kunnen we dan gaan dat is sterk afhankelijk van de prestaties komt het voetbalteam ver hoe doen de vrouwen hockeyers het de goede en slechte dagen van de sporters kun je niet inschatten
8048147 we hadden een prognose gemaakt van maximaal 100 000 gelijktijdige kijkers het is stom toeval dat we daar precies ge indigd zijn die middag hebben we snel moeten schakelen met aanpassingen voor bepaalde providers zijn we op lagere bandbreedtes overgeschakeld om de zaak draaiende te houden de hoge bandbreedtes hebben we de nek omgedraaid om zo veel mogelijk lucht te cre ren
8048148 wij bieden content aan die de klanten van de providers graag willen bekijken terwijl ze gewoon betalen dan kan de provider toch niet zeggen dat ze dat niet kunnen bieden ik denk dat deze discussie de komende jaren sterk zal spelen omdat we nu weer tegen de grenzen opgelopen zijn van wat er kan
8048149 niet onder de indruk ik heb het gevoel dat ik niet kan hardmaken dat de ster meer inspanningen verricht voor televisiereclame dan voor online reclame volgens mij is er voor dit soort succesvolle sites meer geld uit de markt te halen

8048232 catholics united believes that the prime time convention appearance of a pro life leader like senator casey indicates the democratic partys willingness to dialogue with americans of all political persuasions on the crucial issues of our day there was a time when the democratic tent wasnt big enough to include pro life catholics senator caseys speaking role is a clear signal that those days are over we are hopeful that tonights address will begin to heal the deep divisions that exist in our country and pave the way for common ground efforts to reduce abortion such as ensuring health care and economic security for women and families
8048233 we thank senator obama and the democratic party for this wonderful opportunity

8048245 the u s economy under president bush is suffering one of the worst downturns in a generation since 2000 more americans are earning less and are faced with rising household bills more families are without health insurance and more american families are living in poverty todays census figures paint a bleak economic picture that americans are tired of looking at and one that they can and will change come november
8048246 families made some progress last year but the current downturn will surely erase those gains if we dont change course since president bush took office nearly six million more americans are living in poverty over seven million more lack health insurance and median family income is 408 lower for the first time on record families are facing a downturn having not yet recovered economically from the last recession we need a new direction that gets the economy back on track puts people back to work and restores broadly shared prosperity

8048262 my concern about this campaign is its giving the indication that the occasional hot dog in the school lunch is going to increase cancer risk
8048263 an occasional hot dog isnt going to increase that risk
8048264 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8048265 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8048266 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8048267 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about
8048268 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do

8048280 the presidents order contained in administrative order 236 is crucial in ensuring that pdaf funds will be released on time for the completion of priority projects and programs of government in the lawmakers districts which will improve the plight of our constituents

8048296 while jefferson county has continued develop as an increasingly popular destination for tourist and government business travel the gsas out of sync per diem rates have been tying the hands of our local establishments
8048297 i urge the gsa to act as soon as possible to close the gap between the local commercial rates and federal rates so that our innkeepers have the opportunity to reach their full potential during the critical summer months when demand for accommodations are at their peak
8048298 with recent studies showing that nearly 10 percent of private employment in jefferson county is tied to tourism it is vital that we take the necessary steps to allow our innkeepers to compete on a level playing field by bringing the per diem rates in line with our local commercial rates well be able to continue the growth of the tourism industry while supporting these jobs that are essential to the regions economy

8048305 they were both decisions that the governors simply could have said the court has said that we have to do it but let them enforce it because those were administrative decisions that had to put that in place and there was no mandate
8048306 judges since you dont feel you need the other branches of government to do their jobs you not only legislate you can come and enforce the laws you make up
8048307 itll probably be down in texas thats where we spend most of our time

8048320 the second is a declaration on a strategic cooperation between the united states and poland
8048321 this capability will be very important to our nato allies for their security just as its very important for the united states and poland
8048322 as if on cue the iranians just in the last couple of weeks have launched a space launch vehicle which again demonstrates additional capabilities and underscores the concerns we have about the growing missile threat from countries like iran
8048323 its not limited to iran i should hasten to add but its certainly an additional matter
8048324 we also talked about the desire of the united states and poland to pursue cooperation involving air and missile defense cooperation

8048331 the natural gas deposits in the marcellus formation offer new revenue opportunities for landowners and communities throughout new york and provide a means to increase our supply of this valuable energy source here at home however it is essential that we do everything possible to evaluate and mitigate any potential threats that the drilling poses to our water and air quality
8048332 with advancements in technology and experience from drilling in other states there is no reason why we can not be good stewards of the environment while also harvesting the benefits of these natural gas deposits
8048333 the recent court decision vacating cair leaves communities in the eastern united states especially vulnerable to soot smog pollution and acid rain as we continue to work toward real oversight to control these harmful emissions power companies can play a leadership role in reducing the environmental and health hazards that cost thousands of lives annually many companies have already taken steps to comply with the provisions of cair and further commitments will help prevent unnecessary harm to communities as we seek a solution
8048334 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them

8048347 this is an important step towards safety for the third busiest airport in new york this money will go a long way in improving travel to and from new york
8048348 it can present serious difficulties for the decennial census program
8048349 our cyclical budget needs to serially increase in the years leading up to the decennial censuses and difficulties most often come up in years ending in nine and zero
8048350 a continuing resolution that freezes our budget would make it very difficult for the census bureau

8048352 and were confident we can get it done in 2007 we operated under a continuing resolution for a while and we still managed to hire at a high rate
8048353 so if we have a continuing resolution through the inauguration and then some sort of omnibus appropriations passed in a reasonable fashion thereafter we wont have any problems with construction
8048354 were planning for it were holding regular staff meetings and going through and identifying our must spend dollars and what can wait

8048378 there were initially five children ranging from age two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8048379 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out
8048380 currently in the legislation it says you have to have a smoke alarm on every floor in a house what were saying is you should have smoke alarm in every bedroom
8048381 this is amazing i got the dvd of you dont mess with the zohan and saw it as well they have given me the credit unlike last time when i had to file a case for my song kaliyon ka chaman after a us based rap band had used the loop of my song in one of their compositions its a nice feeling as the jimmy song was one of my earlier hits for which we had worked really hard as an artiste its always a nice feeling to be recognised and appreciated internationally
8048382 we have a network of publishers across the world the request to use the jimmy song in you dont mess with the zohan had come to us from the us what happens is that our publishers recommend our work in certain projects we have a network agency called royal network who worked out the deals details for us i dont remember the exact amount of the deal it differs from film to film
8048383 these days i dont ask any questions i just land up on the set and do whats told to me and go home agar mujhe koi kahein ki jaake bhains ko dhona hai toh main woh bhi kar loonga

8048390 we need to ensure that we learn the lessons of those two events and that we continue to strengthen an integrated process to defend ourselves against these kinds of intrusion
8048391 its critical to our mission that we are comfortable that we have a secure network that its resilient to probes and attacks and that it will be able to sustain good decision making for the nations leaders
8048392 all of those have to come together in a unified effort if we are to maintain adequate defense against those who might intrude to our networks and try to disrupt them its a big challenge
8048393 if you are going to be successful at defending it you have to have strong and close integration among the various agencies
8048394 because this is such a broad area and it touches so many different elements of our society business medical care information certainly military and economic many of those same organizations are struggling with how do you pull them together in a more coherent fashion
8048395 im not as worried that a cold war relationship is returning so much
8048396 those are things we have to pay attention to but i think it is important not to swing the pendulum too much in an alarmist fashion
8048397 i dont see a threat to the nation coming from the arctic
8048398 but i do see security concerns that will arise as you have nations compete for resources as you have nations compete for passage as you have commercial interests competing for passage through the area all of those have a security element and i think we just have to have a good discussion about it
8048399 if we believed we have solved the problem we are almost guaranteeing it will come back you cant take your eye off the ball in this kind of a situation
8048400 we are seeing a team now that is closer knit than maybe ever before

8048415 senator joe biden may be one of the only u s politicians that can get iraqs feuding sunni shiite and kurdish politicians to agree but not in a good way

8048420 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
8048421 the confusion here is between john mccain rhetoric that no ones love of country should be questioned and the reality of his campaigns daily false personal and detestable attacks on senator obama
8048422 but its not a surprising tactic from john mccain who is offering four more years of karl roves playbook to distract from his plan for four more years of george bushs failed policies which have left america far less secure and shredded our alliances in the world
8048423 no challenge too great for a world that stands as one

8048445 on the surface this amendment sounds like something most democrats would want to vote for it gets rid of what sounds like racial favoritism
8048446 it takes a while to explain to people that there are certain implications to this
8048447 for the average democrat voter he or she is concerned about their kids getting into college
8048448 they don t have time for lofty political debates that many elite democrats can afford to have the liberal elites already have their college and employment connections whereas ordinary blue collar voters don t
8048449 last night i was called an uncle tom by emil jones state senate president in the lobby of the hotel right in front of ald freddrenna lyle and ald leslie hairston and ald latasha thomas
8048450 i walked over to him and asked him what did you just call me
8048451 if people are still making digs at the hillary clinton people because we supported her that is not going to bring us on board it makes us feel as though we re outsiders and we re democrats
8048452 the litmus test for being black is seen as supporting barack
8048453 you can tell the hillary clinton people they never take the buttons
8048454 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics that s why the clintons did so and so i said i don t want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing i said what did you say i turned to freddrenna lyle and i said what did he say she wouldn t say anything that s when i said some bad things to him
8048455 mr wilbanks refuses to acknowledge that his comments were offensive
8048456 his behavior today was condescending and he was clearly not open to constructive feedback amp nbsp the inability to see from others perspective and apologize is unacceptable in a leader

8048458 in considering these comments it should be noted that at present there are three residential properties served from this private driveway and although there is a fourth house approved this has yet to be built
8048459 it is also unlikely that any more housing sites could be developed off this private access the visibility at the access will also be significantly improved and the boundary hedge will be relocated as part of a neighbouring development
8048460 in light of this roads officials have confirmed that the access on to the public road is both acceptable and can adequately serve the development it is our opinion that on balance the proposal is acceptable and to refuse the application solely on the issue of numbers in this instance would be unreasonable

8048504 after 75 years in barnsdale road moving to a new location at royal stuart way at forthbank was always going to be challenging

8048506 for our young people who got their first experience of the new building the impact has been tremendous

8048516 listening to the catholic bishops can help mitigate your ignorance of the catholic faith regarding issues like for example abortion
8048517 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8048518 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8048519 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

8048530 the risky part will be if some of her supporters indulge themselves in boos and catcalls when obama is mentioned because thats the kind of negative drama that the media and you are wanting to see

8048553 this has been a problem going back two years on the pakistan account
8048554 the pakistan political situation is highly unstable right now and the last thing the u s needs is for it to become the central focus of that instability through accusations that it is propping up or scheming behind the scenes with one of the major political players
8048555 pakistani leaders are also guilty of putting too much attention on currying favor with u s leaders rather than focusing on governing their own country and dealing with the myriad of challenges there
8048556 he is the former ambassador to iraq and afghanistan his close relationship to the president has been acknowledged
8048557 you are a player and if another leader is looking to you for help and advice they have to assume it is coming from the upper echelons of the government

8048568 if it goes in the direction of aggravating relations its not going to be our choice
8048569 i want to remind you that cold war was a completely different beast when we were really at each others throats in a big way internationally and this is not going to happen under any circumstances
8048570 it will create new pressures on the regional level throughout the caucasus and further complicates international affairs among the powers of the world
8048571 their use of force against south ossetia clearly dashed all of those previous resolutions and created a completely new reality
8048572 there is no way you can dash or cancel or

8048577 its a really tough retail environment out there but we managed to improve our results
8048578 at this point i cant say what we expect from this feature were just curious to see how it will be used
8048579 unfortunately because the examples he provides are still only experiments we cannot talk in length about how they work if we end up rolling out this experiment for all users we would definitely be able to talk in more detail right now we are experimenting with a number of factors so we cant really explain how the final product would work
8048580 we are thrilled that this jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the marketplace and not the courtroom
8048581 our fresh perspective is evidenced by innovative designs that appeal to todays tv demographics
8048582 a man in the intercepting land cruiser rolled down the window and opened fire with a kalashnikov rifle but the diplomat remained unhurt

8048588 the sergeant discovered inside his truck a bullet proof vest two rifles ammunition walkie talkies and drugs
8048589 it is unknown whether the absence of a threat is because the group are in custody or because they were never frankly up to it
8048590 the internet is a direct response media right now but there is a lot of interest right now for brands that want to come online
8048591 an advertiser wont tolerate a campaign going dark because someone bid a penny more for inventory
8048592 all of the things that are going on in the economy arent just by happenstance
8048593 they are a direct result of policies that george bush and john mccain have put in place and now their answer is lets keep on doing the same thing
8048594 one thing i have said several times when i have been with obama is that he really showed a lot of composure against the karl rove style unrelenting attacks
8048595 es muy buena persona se hace querer la conoc s y la ador s
8048596 a lot of hard work goes into organising the event but its all worthwhile when you see how much the people who came along enjoyed it

8048604 the privacy youre concerned about is largely an illusion all you have to give up is your illusions not any of your privacy
8048605 if the nineteenth century was a world of privacy and prudery a world of closed doors and drawn blinds
8048606 then the world of the twenty first century is the world of the one way mirror the world of the all seeing eye
8048607 obviously if youre a terrorist privacy is enormously important so the more we think of privacy as endangering us that will reinforce these commercial incentives to surrender privacy
8048608 welcome to the twlight zone this week we get weirded out in two seperate post codes but never fret we still manage to bring you great songs by wonk unit thee out mods last man down the scurge jonny dongel and the 4get me nots
8048609 beginning to have serious repercussions on public health and young peoples life prospects
8048610 it will continue to do so for future generations unless something is done to tackle the problem
8048611 dig it first they killed those pigs then they ate dinner in the same room with them they even shoved a fork into a victims stomach wild
8048612 theres a pretty strong relationship between the ability to pass those tests and be ready for the first round of freshman level courses
8048613 how about you pay attention to the real polls like gallup
8048614 bottles of beer you take one down you pass it
8048615 bottles of beer you take one down you pass it
8048616 why not wait until we had breakfast and discuss it further
8048617 there are a lot more complicated issues than just copyright or trademark there are more complex issues than those in respect to the end user licensing agreement and antitrust issues come into play too

8048619 we looked at our diaries and said to each other why not bringing together our projects was going to be a first with the mus e picasso we set about learning to work closely as a four
8048620 i will be the first to sign up to a move towards a political project which i would like to lead
8048621 so of course i will accept the foremost task of a party member if the socialists will trust me with it
8048622 we intend to come together with a clear direction reformist european environmental and dedicated to a left that works to win in 2012
8048623 as people feel that its not a problem for me it is no longer a problem for them
8048624 people were killed and theyre building on top of their bones
8048625 new orleans has experienced a profound change in who governs schools and a dramatic reduction of parent and local taxpayer control of schools
8048626 50 of them are charter schools privatized management governed by self appointed self perpetuating boards 33 are run by the state department of education through the recovery school district and only five are governed by the elected school board
8048627 there are now 42 separate school systems operating in new orleans
8048628 school policies including teacher requirements curriculum discipline policies enrollment limits and social promotions publicly accountable schools in which parents have methods for publicly redressing grievances are limited to only five schools 5 6 of the total
8048629 but the people down here need the world to understand that its still a tragic situation the rent has tripled the health care system is in shambles we have less access to education for our kids the working class and poor are being exploited while everyone at the top is getting fat off our misery
8048630 we think august 29 should be holy day not a day for business as usual
8048631 the mayor announced to the world that new orleans was open for business but were here to tell you that it is closed for families
8048632 five thousand demolished homes eight thousand new jail beds this is their one for one replacement plan for us
8048633 we are very happy that dawn airey will start at the end of october working for five and she will make a difference

8048635 bridge of allans green congregation is committed to the care of the environment hence the use of renewable energy
8048636 that didnt waver when one gm or one personnel guy or one coach told me that i wasnt good enough for that team
8048637 the longer i went along the more i focused and realized it was about me playing well
8048638 if i were able to put everything aside and just control the things that i could control my performance my preparation i think that i would have been more happy with the journey
8048639 there were different circumstances in each of the places but i flat out didnt agree with their decisions so thats why im playing today
8048640 obviously when things dont go well when youre sitting at home and you have no other choice you look at other peoples paths to play in this league in this position and theres not a whole lot of smooth stories there just isnt
8048641 once you realize that this is your story at some point you have to take this on yourself to realize that youre not going to be given an opportunity or nobody is going to hand you an opportunity to play youre going to have to claw and scratch just to stay in the league youre going to have to do everything you can to have the opportunity to make a team and once you get that opportunity to make a team to show them that you can play
8048642 i think what it is with j t is he can play the part
8048643 hes super intelligent hes never going to make a mental mistake nowadays in the nfl above the shoulders is way more important than below the shoulders
8048644 the big thing for osullivan is he can make the throws that mike martzs offense requires
8048645 i dont know if id be saying thats the greatest thing in the world im worried now about going out there and playing you know but this is obviously the step that you need to take to play so im definitely excited about that opportunity
8048646 with the exception of when hes on a lot of drugs
8048647 i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy
8048648 yeah my dad can be that guy but its not all of him
8048649 so this is more like a talking book a really thorough autobiography
8048650 my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius in my opinion
8048651 he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that
8048652 for the most part generally hes more often than not not a complete idiot most of the time
8048653 democrats didnt pursue watergate when carter came in they didnt pursue iran contra when clinton came in and they are not going to pursue this when obama comes in
8048654 democrats are going to say listen guys we have a positive agenda we want to move forward we want to solve the problems of this country and we dont need to get bogged down in this kind of stuff
8048655 its this let bygones be bygones view that is wrong and why this week is so critical the timing so important in trying to reach as many members of congress as i can reach
8048656 eric and rebecca used to love spending time together and were barely apart
8048657 but as erics gotten more famous rebeccas behavior has gotten more erratic one second shes jealous of his success the next shes angry and wont speak to him eric never knew what to expect
8048658 patrick dempsey enjoyed the chocolate vegan cake and ellen pompeo has gone to truly vegan half a dozen times since trying the food
8048659 the officer told katherine to pick up the butt and throw it away in the trash 10 feet away
8048660 he added that hed fine her next time he catches her tossing trash on the sidewalk
8048661 i can host 7 stds at the same time without you knowing it
8048662 the gringoes deserve a more elaborate message since they are educated people and we care about what they think of us
8048663 clinging to guns and their faith when the jobs dried up
8048664 this has been one of the toughest nights of my life
8048665 strongest aspiration is to safeguard this from ever happening again
8048666 marketers are increasingly eager to attract customers with web 2 0 and social media
8048667 shoutlet gives any company an intuitive cost effective way to generate sales using web 2
8048668 shoutlet provides immediate opportunities for salesforce com customers to manage and track social media marketing campaigns for their companies shoutlet
8048669 and here we go again mr phelps up to the podium grab the garlands kiss the presenter smile wait for the flash bulbs to die and were clear
8048670 the alarming part of this report is the acceleration of inflation in the past 3 months while the unadjusted rate for the past 12 months was 6 2 the 3 month annualized rate of increase was 11 9
8048671 on a seasonally adjusted basis the cpi u advanced 0 8 percent in july following a 1 1 percent increase in june
8048672 about half of the overall increase in the all items index
8048673 the food index rose 0 9 percent in july after rising 0 8 percent in june indexes for five of the six major grocery store food groups rose at least 1 0 percent
8048674 were seeing more and more people visiting food banks for the first time because theyve lost their jobs or theyre not getting raises
8048675 the cpi w is used for making the annual cost of living adjustments to social security payments
8048676 while consumers suffer inflation a the bottom of the pricing pipeline producers feel it at the top
8048677 to the extent inflation gets stuck with them their profits suffer
8048678 sales have picked up significantly in several florida and california markets home prices generally follow sales trends after a few months of lag time
8048679 still inventory remains high in many parts of the country and will require time to fully absorb
8048680 whether they like it or not we have to be reckoned with
8048681 its an absolute certainty that the americans wont impose any sanctions because they themselves would suffer
8048682 i havent noticed that theyve actively welcomed us into the wto anyway
8048683 i am hoping u s officials will have enough common sense not to link wto issues with politics
8048684 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
8048685 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
8048686 russia would not suffer much if any immediate economic pain as a result of such a delay since the direct trade effects of accession the impact of tariff changes and improved access to foreign markets will be limited
8048687 reduction in formal and informal barriers to foreign investment in key service sectors and the overhaul of technical regulations
8048688 significant growth not only in the extractive industries but in products as diverse as innovative pharmaceuticals farm machinery information technology and an increasing array of services
8048689 perhaps no other country is able to offer the united states as broad a range of partnership opportunities or capabilities for cooperation in every scientific or technical sphere
8048690 russia wont be able to sustain its growth without foreign capital and international experience while the west needs a strong ally in its fight with global terrorism and iran besides russia is the only large energy supplier outside middle east
8048691 we can ask consumers of our gas whether they want to be friends with russia
8048692 there was a time in world history when russia was the only superpower on the european continent
8048693 viemos negociando com a administra o e foi dito para n s que o problema seria resolvido que a empresa respons vel pela manuten o j havia feito testes dessa forma os agentes continuaram trabalhando na grande s o pedro sem comunica o isso prejudica a situa o da guarda que fica descoberta em casos em que precisa de apoio
8048694 a torre melhoraria e muito a qualidade da comunica o n o s da guarda municipal mas do profissional que depende do r dio transmissor para exercer suas atividades
8048695 quando pega no centro e em s o pedro ningu m ouve a gente na orla o ciodes n o consegue copiar e n s ficamos sem apoio se acontecer alguma coisa na orla e for para o centro ningu m fica sabendo
8048696 vai ficar uma situa o complicada acho que vai aumentar a criminalidade principalmente os furtos pequenos no com rcio do bairro
8048697 com guarda j estava violento imagina agora sem a guarda meu filho foi assassinado h cerca de um m s dentro de um bar e n o era para ter sido ele mas aconteceu e acho que agora vai piorar
8048698 queremos encerrar esta primeira fase em primeiro lugar at mesmo para ganhar moral visando o returno ent o temos que nos impor em campo e temos certeza que faremos isso
8048699 foi horr vel ficar de fora estava no est dio e queria de qualquer jeito ajudar meus companheiros come amos mal mas mostramos personalidade e vencemos contra o serra espero que joguemos bem nos dois tempos
8048700 estamos unidos e aos poucos conseguimos assimilar a proposta do t cnico cosme eduardo no aspecto t tico com certeza temos tudo para chegarmos s fases decisivas e quem sabe brigar pelo t tulo
8048701 n o possivel que tenha sido uma frigideira a causa dessa trag dia outros quiosques tamb m pegaram fogo quer dizer que todos foram pelo mesmo motivo
8048702 n s somos pessoas humildes minha nica renda vem desse ponto o valor dos estragos muito alto n o sei como vou fazer daqui para frente

8048705 we respect your viewpoint but we also respect the vision of the filmmaker and decided to use live animals
8048706 must be tricked sedated or forcibly restrained when the infants are pulled from them and this cruel practice leaves lifelong emotional scars
8048707 chimps should be with their mothers for the first five years
8048708 were a nonprofit were not staffed to do that kind of comprehensive oversight
8048709 if we are witnessing good care thats our focus to make the assumption that when they leave the set they will treat the animals differently is not something we do animals need consistency if youre treating an animal in training with positive rewards then youre not going to come to the set and beat it with a stick and expect the same results
8048710 no animals were harmed in the making of this film
8048711 with great apes were asking them to add that the aha is not present for the training of great apes prior to the animals being on the set
8048712 people have a false sense that because the aha is on set during a movie that disclaimer means that everything is ok its not
8048713 i saw a lot of physical violence a lot of punching and kicking and the use of the ugly stick a sawed off broom handle to beat the chimps the youngest i met were 18 months old and were pretty similar to an 18 month old human child they were being kicked in the face and punched in the head and subject to all kinds of physical abuse to keep them paying attention and in line with the trainer
8048714 its very similar to an abusive human relationship the bottom line is chimps are super strong and super curious and super smart and the amount of control that the trainers require to keep them paying attention and not misbehaving its too much to be able to do with love and kisses the way the trainers are able to control them is behind the scenes they have this very brutal relationship including discipline when they misbehave and random violence without any seeming provocation that keeps their attention on the trainer
8048715 the violence begins at birth and the chimps live so long
8048716 if we get a chance to help make an impact on a kids life thats why were here
8048717 hes never played a fundraising event this was going to be his first one ever
8048718 i think that speaks to the amount of respect he has for our friendship weve been together now for over 20 years
8048719 i suspect theres a tremendous chance hell be on the property next year but the most important thing is that he gets his knee back where he wants to
8048720 roy clayton is more understanding of samirs position than anybody else in the fbi actually is
8048721 what they have in common is that roys father was a baptist minister and samirs father was a religious man as well
8048722 when guy and i first sat down to look at the script he was enthusiastic about it
8048723 he said look jeffrey i normally have a lot of notes i have to say i dont have many notes on this script but lets literally go through it page by page and look at every line and we did and he would analyze sometimes down to a contraction saying i do not versus i dont that type of thing for guy could be important
8048724 ill generally write out every scene thats in the film on a couple of pieces of paper just with a little one line
8048725 and then i can scan it a bit and go this first third of the film generally im kind of calm then i might do something on one piece of paper that just relates to the energy of the character
8048726 ive got a bit of obsessive compulsive disorder i think so i can get a little obsessed about detail stuff
8048727 i would feel quite anxious around people and be nervous that i was going to get asked some question i couldnt answer and i wasnt going to know what to say
8048728 on stage youve got dialogue youve learned youve got a paying audience it couldnt be better you know my therapist would say its probably because of having lost my dad when i was really young and that being a really tragic thing that i was worried about what was potentially around the corner being really disastrous so in doing a play or doing some structured work as an actor its set thats probably why i was drawn to it in a way
8048729 it was a pivotal film for me and quite a good representation of what im interested in
8048730 it probably enabled a little more confidence i tend to project my father figure onto any director that im working with or mother if im working with a female or it can be confused but chris nolans trusting me was really important and just allowed me to trust myself more
8048731 it was a bit of a breakdown actually and i was smoking a lot of pot leading up to that time as well and that clearly didnt help at all
8048732 id just been taking opportunity after opportunity after opportunity i didnt have my own direction going on so it was really about decompressing and i was seeing a therapist and i just needed to take stock
8048733 why now athletes now have more responsibilities and we want to help their professional development
8048734 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8048735 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8048736 global tour and is not targeting any specific player or country
8048737 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8048738 we are connecting with fans and sponsors like never before
8048739 but we want things to continue to get better to continue to grow
8048740 if we win ill go down as having the lowest iq of any genius who ever lived
8048741 im really happy that i dont have to pick four players this morning i can tell you that
8048742 it would have been very difficult to know what to do
8048743 im looking for the hottest players but they dont play for the united states
8048744 so i can look at the top 12 guys and maybe make a choice just based on that
8048745 i dont know if you look down that list i like the next four guys a lot
8048746 it was more a case of settling on who i didnt want than necessarily who i wanted good luck mr azinger
8048747 it has been an extremely difficult decision to make given my burning desire to represent europe again in defending the ryder cup in the united states
8048748 and hope that my performance so far this year will earn one of his two wild card picks
8048749 thats a lot of movement as it relates to us and our field size
8048750 i got to play those major tournaments before i die
8048751 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
8048752 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative

8048759 a professional organization holding this kind of data should have tested the disks to make sure the information was destroyed
8048760 graphic data has confirmed to us that one of their machines appears to have been inappropriately sold on via a third party
8048761 as a result historical data relating to credit card applications from some of our customers and data from other banks were not removed we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
8048762 the it equipment that appeared on ebay was not planned to be disposed of by the company and investigations are still ongoing to find out how this equipment was removed from one of graphic datas secure locations
8048763 we take customer privacy and data security very seriously this incident is extremely regrettable and were taking every possible step to retrieve the data and ensure this is an isolated incident
8048764 it is essential that companies have appropriate procedures in place to ensure that personal records are kept secure at all times the ico said in a statement
8048765 if companies are disposing of computer equipment they must take the necessary steps to ensure that any personal information stored on the hard drive is rendered unrecoverable we are now investigating this potential data breach and will be seeking an urgent explanation from graphic data to establish what has gone wrong and the steps that are being taken to prevent a similar incident occurring

8048768 someone figure out which are the long poles and which are the short ones and where we need to put them
8048769 my goal is to provide an alternative not to free the mac os
8048770 what we want to do is to provide an alternative an option its not that people dont want to use mac os many people are open to the idea but theyre not used to spending an exorbitant amount of money on something that is essentially generic hardware

8048779 paloschi there is something going on but we have to meet with his agent
8048780 he writes in a way that makes giving close attention a pleasure
8048781 there is a difference between a true threat and the recorded racist rantings of drug abusers
8048782 there is a fine line between a credible threat and a threat that is carried out
8048783 it is not up to us to determine whether or not it was a credible threat we saw that there was criminal activity going on and given the heightened security because of the convention we had to notify other agencies
8048784 we cant sit and wait until folks have done the final analysis we have a duty to react
8048785 he dont belong in political office or blacks dont belong in political office
8048786 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8048787 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8048788 russia is a state which has to ensure its interests along the whole length of its border this is absolutely clear
8048789 there is no blockade any ship can get in american and others are bringing in humanitarian cargoes and what the americans call humanitarian cargoes of course they are bringing in weapons
8048790 russias actions in recent weeks call into question russias commitment to peace and stability in the caucasus
8048791 i dont think we should be afraid of isolation i dont believe isolation is looming
8048792 russias actions are an attempt to militarily annex a sovereign nation in direct violation of international law
8048793 the russian federation is seeking to validate the use of violence direct military aggression and ethnic cleansing to forcibly change the borders of a neighbouring state
8048794 this is not an easy choice to make but it represents the only possibility to save human lives
8048795 saakashvili opted for genocide to accomplish his political objectives by doing so he himself dashed all the hopes for the peaceful coexistence of ossetians abkhazians and georgians in a single state
8048796 absolutely inevitable short of losing our dignity as a nation
8048797 the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
8048798 we are thrilled that the jury sent a strong message that they want these companies to compete in the market place and not in the courtroom
8048799 nintega will be the webs 3rd most popular video game blog by mid 2010

8048808 our first priority must be the safety of the public
8048809 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8048810 a thousand years ago it was thought that through heating lead was made non toxic which is clearly not the case these traditions live on and they carry on endangering our health
8048811 tell people that biology and the environment cause obesity and they are offered the one thing we have to avoid an excuse
8048812 as it is people who see more fat people around them may themselves be more likely to gain weight young people who think many of their friends binge drink are likely to do so themselves girls who think their peers engage in early sex are more likely to do so themselves
8048813 peer pressure and social norms are powerful influences on behaviour and they are classic excuses
8048814 we will take action to ensure people have the opportunities information and incentives towards healthy living
8048815 tackling the environment should not be a licence to lecture people because they have no excuse not to exercise or eat their fruit and vegetables nannying at least among adults is likely to be counterproductive providing information is empowering lecturing people is not so no excuses no nannying
8048816 we must not constantly talk about tackling obesity and warning people about the negative consequences of obesity instead we must be positive positive about the fun and benefits to be had from healthy living trying to get rid of peoples excuses for being obese by tackling the issue in a positive way
8048817 the proper role of government is to create certainty in the market and maintain a clear distinction between compulsory regulation and voluntary action where necessary the government should regulate clearly and enforce the regulations strongly
8048818 there is a risk that responsibility deals would confuse this issue by being almost a form of regulation by proxy and would lack credibility
8048819 were being treated by the city of denver and the secret service like political prisoners
8048820 stay for just a couple of minutes to state our disgust with this abomination the way the city and secret service are tearing the constitution of the united states to shreds
8048821 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
8048822 could i just mention to you jay in a moment of seriousness
8048823 that i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table
8048824 for example a bbc radio documentary exposing tensions between leadership and supporters
8048825 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
8048826 just a message for my darling sister lorraine who just stepped on at this station remember how you said that if you ever saw that i was the driver of a train you would not get on it well i am the driver and you are on my train stand clear of the doors please
8048827 bradman will always be remembered for his cricket but as richie benaud another cricket star said when delivering the eulogy at bradmans funeral he was also a sportsman
8048828 suppose youre a voter and youve got candidate x and candidate y candidate x agrees with you on everything but you dont think that candidate can deliver on anything at all candidate y you agree with on about half the issues but he can deliver which candidate are you going to vote for
8048829 this has nothing to do with whats going on now
8048830 there are two choices in this election obama and hillary clinton or mccain and bush
8048831 as far as cruise missiles are concerned they are strategic arms and have a range of 2 500 km the black sea is just a pool for them
8048832 things are changing pretty quickly for tapulous however and not exactly for the better according to a
8048833 the engineering and design team had concerns about the direction the company was heading
8048834 as the founder and leader of that team it was my job to press those concerns that put me at loggerheads to the other partners and the board sided with them
8048835 im not doing anything to encourage that and have made sure each and every one of them is aware that i want them to stay at tapulous and will not be recruiting them if they didnt end up staying at tapulous then im sure apple would like to talk to them
8048836 elvis is everywhere plays out as youd expect nixon rants about how elvis constructed the great pyramids of giza and claims that he can see the king in everyone around him while roper backs him up with a pre beatles bluesy riff
8048837 why would you want to go 160 miles away just to study how to read and write in english youre better off studying pharmacy at vcu or computer at george mason
8048838 theres no question hes a good governor and hes well thought of
8048839 but with biden on the ticket he almost offsets that
8048840 its going to be a hard act to follow the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn
8048841 trabalhar com shannen bom todo mundo fez um grande estardalha o sobre isso mas n o h problema algum n o existe nenhum drama
8048842 if we can do it in pennsylvania we can do it in ohio we can do it in florida we can do it in texas we can do it in new york we can do it in california we can do it in every state in the union we can and with barack obama and joe biden we will
8048843 its going to be a hard act to follow the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn
8048844 this is where i grew up and i love it i just feel proud to come from here let alone having anything named after me
8048845 i made a promise before the olympics and here it is
8048846 i just hope that loads of young people get involved in sport it neednt be to win it can just be for fun but get involved
8048847 i lived next door to her swimming teacher maureen pitchfork she was a very special person she got into the final of the 1954 commonwealth games she inspired the kids and im sure rebecca will do the same
8048848 shes a very good swimmer and the whole of our familys very proud of her
8048849 i dont know who did that but no ones disagreeing round here
8048850 shes such a genuine person is rebecca all us neighbours went round last night and she stayed on the street for ages signing autographs for the children
8048851 shed only just flown from beijing and shed had all the interviews at london airport and met gordon brown but she stayed out there until everyone had got what they wanted she didnt get tired or say stop ive had enough just like she didnt in the races she won
8048852 because he integrated baseball i was not sure what this meant but i knew it was wonderful
8048853 the stain of racial segregation beclouded american society blacks and whites pursued separate and unequal lives not just in the south but throughout the nation confronted by rigid barriers created by the color line african americans forged their own institutions and culture creating a world invisible to most whites but nonetheless vibrant innovative and distinctive baseball offered one of the most dynamic examples of this phenomenon
8048854 his book showed us exactly how we got to where we are
8048855 ci hanno mostrato che se violi la legge basta avere soldi per pagare se hai belle gambe puoi sposare un miliardario e fare shopping con la sua carta di credito spingi salta la fila corrompi cambia opinione secondo la convenienza mettiti al soldo di chi ti dar una paghetta magari nella forma di una bella presidenza di ente pubblico di un ministero

8048858 this is contrary to the principles of the independence the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia
8048859 examine from this point of view the consequences of russias decision
8048860 fully shares and supports the council presidencys statement strongly condemning the decision by the russian authorities to recognise the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia
8048861 i have appealed to all leaders concerned to speed up georgias nato and eu integration we already have some positive signals from our north atlantic and european partners
8048862 were certainly in the process of stabilising in terms of housing although i wouldnt want to say were there yet what we can say with some level of certainty is that the sharp declines in home sales are behind us and were flattening out
8048863 its very much a reflection of whats been going on in the energy markets
8048864 confidence remains quite low principally because of concerns about employment prospects
8048865 its clear that it will still take some time to work through the downturn in housing
8048866 once housing prices stabilise that will signal a return to a housing industry that can contribute to economic growth
8048867 despite the disclosure of some of the contents of the convention there is much that remains unknown to the iraqi public since no harm would result if iraqs government made the contents of the draft convention public before it is finalized that is exactly what it should do that would be in the interest of creating a national consensus and would show the iraqi people how the agreement is compatible with their own aspirations it would also allay the fears of those who oppose the deal even though many of these people were opposed to the agreement even before its first letters were written
8048868 the fact that hes launching his own convention by defending his long association with a man who says he didnt bomb enough u s targets tells us more about barack obama than any of tonights speeches will
8048869 the obama campaign knows it cant argue the facts of the link between obama and ayers so it is instead resorting to a desperate campaign of intimidation and legal threats
8048870 the scary question this raises is if barack obama demonstrates this little regard for free speech from his opponents during the campaign what could the american people expect from him as a president
8048871 the tremendous amount of time money and effort the campaign is expending to run its own ads on the ayers controversy and dispatch its hired guns all over the country during the democratic convention speaks to the fear they must have that this issue is resonating with american voters
8048872 a suite of political tools that embody the new political focus of merging cutting edge technology and old fashioned community
8048873 as an ardent practicing catholic abortion is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8048874 since it must be treated from conception as a person the embryo must be defended in its integrity cared for and healed as far as possible like any other human being
8048875 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8048876 the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8048877 if they want relations to worsen they will get it
8048878 in this situation the ball is in the europeans court
8048879 this contradicts the principle of territorial integrity a principle based on the international law of nations and for this reason it is unacceptable
8048880 clearly russia has used the language of kosovo as a precedent having spent most of the build up to kosovos independence and the immediate aftermath decrying it as a kind of assault on international law
8048881 i think we have to be much more precise in saying what is a parallel and what is not
8048882 tit for tat if you do that to us well do the same to you
8048883 but from a political propaganda point of view they the russians will present it as revenge for kosovo
8048884 poland will say we warned you the soviets are back with this it will be more difficult for the moderates to say we should not alienate russia
8048885 without the ratification of the saa in the serbian parliament a positive report on serbias progress towards eu rapprochement will not enter into procedure
8048886 german carmakers want co2 targets to only apply to the cleanest cars in the early years its the equivalent of demanding that a smoking ban should only apply to non smokers
8048887 funny games us could actually be called the better film because its directed towards the appropriate
8048888 health insurance premiums have risen 4 times faster than wages over the past 6 years
8048889 increased regulation a government designed standard benefits package and a new pooling mechanism
8048890 it is always the providers asking for the mandate it is never the consumer
8048891 guaranteed eligibility no american will be turned away from any insurance plan because of illness or pre existing conditions
8048892 insurance so expensive that millions of people are exposed to financial ruin because they arent allowed to buy basic policies focused on catastrophic costs
8048893 869 million for the program for fiscal year 2009 compared with previous estimates of 725 million
8048894 50 billion to 65 billion a year when fully phased in
8048895 the revenues from rolling back the tax cuts were enough to cover it
8048896 less than 4 cents of every health care dollar is spent on prevention and public health
8048897 the electoral map in 2010 is more favorable for us
8048898 its going to be a hard act to follow the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn
8048899 i think in 2010 well break that cycle and elect a democrat
8048900 theres no doubt that our party is replete with really talented men and women
8048901 its going to be a hard act to follow the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn
8048902 i am certain that sen clinton will hit it out of the park
8048903 its going to be a hard act to follow the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn
8048904 shes the osama bin laden of green terrorists if she saw you throw away a plastic fork she would take that fork out of the trash and come after you with it and then shed rinse it off and recycle it
8048905 im calling it the dark green movement that is just blatantly hostile the point is not really protecting the environment the point is an opportunity to be able to feel superior to someone else and to kind of get off on releasing a little bit of anger
8048906 colectivo 7 que ya fue expuesta en barcelona buenos aires y varios departamentos del pa s
8048907 this is a major milestone for tomotherapy and in turn for cancer centers of all sizes
8048908 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programs to encourage and support behaviour change
8048909 our first priority must be the safety of the public
8048910 herbs and supplements with high levels of lead mercury and arsenic should not be available for sale on the internet or elsewhere
8048911 we suggest strictly enforced government mandated daily dose limits for toxic metals in all dietary supplements and requirements that all manufacturers demonstrate compliance through independent third party testing
8048912 several indian manufactured rasa shastra medicines could result in lead and or mercury ingestions 100 to 10 000 times greater than acceptable limits
8048913 from the type of symptoms we are seeing their duration the underlying age and health status of the individuals we really dont believe that this is listeriosis
8048914 its not unusual during the summer to see clusters of gastrointestinal illness in a summer camp setting
8048915 elder abuse can take many forms including physical sexual financial emotional psychological and neglect
8048916 the idea is to develop a local resource guide which will include contacts and also train volunteers in the community to recognise certain signs relating to abuse and work to address it
8048917 its important older people are always mindful and aware of people around them and that people in the community are trained to pick up on signs of elder abuse
8048918 the idea is to get everyone together to have a chat
8048919 its really important that we start to bring a new council culture that is open and honest even with strong difference of opinions
8048920 some of these people will have to work together and everyone always works best when were comfortable together

8048922 and when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me shine on until tomorrow let it be
8048923 we expect the european council convening for an extraordinary summit will adopt an unequivocal position supporting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
8048924 we continue to wait for the full realisation of the six point sarkozy medvedev plan in which the last point speaks of the necessity of an international discussion on the topic of the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia and solutions that guarantee lasting security of the region
8048925 it is our view that all other steps taken in the current situation would make difficult the application of the above plan and the concluded agreement and will be met with the deep disapproval and concern of the international community

8048927 whether producing a 30 second spot the nightly news or a major motion picture final cut studio is the choice of editors around the world
8048928 with the introduction of final cut server collaboration just got a whole lot easier for millions of editors producers and clients who work with final cut studio
8048929 for the past few months weve been using a beta of final cut server to manage our entire workflow pipeline 24 7 and it held up beautifully
8048930 best of all final cut server integrates seamlessly with our home grown solutions so its actually adding new value to systems weve relied on for years
8048931 often there are better ways to reach our customers the increasing popularity of our retail stores and apple com web site allows us to directly reach more than 100 million customers around the world in innovative new ways
8048932 this is going to change the role of assistants on visual effects films now they can devote their energy to running an efficient cutting room instead of poring over changes
8048933 the plugin also serves as a great tool to make notations in sequences as youre cutting
8048934 we believe this product answers to a high demand among editors and their assistants it will save people a tremendous amount of time and it will ensure accurate visual effects data because it virtually eliminates the opportunity for human error
8048935 our customers had been asking for a 4 bay raid 5 external storage solution capable of the high bandwidth requirements of editing uncompressed hd with for some time now
8048936 we responded to these needs by manufacturing the hdelement raid 0 1 5 6 amp jbod storage solution product
8048937 what she needs to do is stump with the guy through november
8048938 they believe that if obama loses theyll be blamed for it if she does everything she can or not
8048939 i think we know shes capable of making attacks because weve seen her do it against barack obama its time to use the same attack mechanism against mccain
8048940 in that one line she changed the entire tone even within the new york delegation
8048941 apple makes a good operating system we dont deny that
8048942 this is about bringing leopard mac os x 10 5 to the masses
8048943 its not that people dont want to use mac os x but theyre not open spending an exorbitant amount of money for something thats essentially generic hardware
8048944 every single copy of the os is a purchased copy
8048945 despite the allegations that theres a master disc thats not the case and allegations that psystar has somehow modified mac os xs code to run on non apple systems thats also not the case
8048946 there is no modification of any proprietary code of apples
8048947 we purchase copies of mac os directly from apple or from an apple authorized dealer
8048948 no specific precedent but we wouldnt be filing this if we didnt believe we could support it
8048949 what we want to do is provide an alternative to apples hardware
8048950 there are reports that four to five people have been killed in fresh violence the deaths are from yesterdays violence there is no fresh violence we have also clamped a curfew in kandhamal district to avoid any violence
8048951 saying naxals are behind the attack is totally misleading and orchestrated this is an attack by the agents of christian missionaries whose attempts at forcible conversions the swamiji countered
8048952 they tried and failed for seven times the eighth time they have succeeded a week before he was killed he had received an anonymous threat that said he would soon be killed though he lodged a formal complaint the officials did not do anything about it
8048953 the administration failed to ensure that the churches and christian institutions were attacked in return so this might be an act of revenge for that given the fact that lakshmanananda was actively combating forcible conversions in the region
8048954 they were very quick to do it probably because they wanted to ensure that communal violence does not break out but eventually they werent able to do that also
8048955 there is nothing that suggests that maosits may be involved though it is soon to say for sure they are not involved there have not been many incidents where they have attacked civilians even in such a case they would have killed the two home guards who were said to have been on duty at the time of attack
8048956 the 2 3 per cent christians in the indian population cater to 20 per cent of all primary education in india 10 per cent of all the literacy and community health care 25 per cent of all existing care of destitutes and orphans 30 per cent of all the handicapped lepers and aids patients etc
8048957 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
8048958 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
8048959 i do not foresee any improvement in these issues for at least a year
8048960 declared him medically fit to run for political office and free of any symptoms
8048961 you have got to understand that while he was in prison on charges that were never proven there were attempts to kill him
8048962 at that time he was surrounded by fear all the time any human being living in such a condition will of course suffer from the effects of continuous fear but that is all history
8048963 we have talked about how to keep the shootout fresh anyway
8048964 i wont kid you that coors having the pole winner created a faster dialogue on how to address it
8048965 its no secret the manufacturers need all the exposure they can get
8048966 the winning manufacturer will have bragging rights for a year hopefully this will evolve into a spirited annual competition
8048967 there were three former staff members who were listed on the search warrant that was served on me in early july and we facilitated the gathering of material for police
8048968 the college received some internet material which contained allegations that i think are linked to the ones that are currently taking place
8048969 those matters were referred to the police some years ago
8048970 those circumstances where people have betrayed trust it is a matter of grave concern and shame and it needs to be addressed comprehensively in order to protect children in the future
8048971 i can assure parents that this school is committed to the most thorough child protection measures that we have been implementing for some considerable period of time
8048972 we work closely with authorities in the area of child protection we are committed to protecting children wherever we can
8048973 weve had five people come forward that formed part of the initial investigation
8048974 and as a consequence to those five people coming forward weve identified another eight people so at this stage were speaking to 13 people
8048975 what we can say at this stage is that there is a number of lines of inquiry that have come from the initial inquiries
8048976 there are a number of inquiries continuing and there are some suspects involved
8048977 the crew reported no injuries and they are now evacuating the aircraft
8048978 the markets will trade in a nervous zig zag for the next few weeks said heinz gerd sonnenschein equity strategist at postbank in germany citing uncertain prospects for economic growth and hence for commodities and currencies as well as persistent financial industry worries
8048979 the german economy will face a sudden and sharp downturn in the second half of this year leading to a fully fledged recession brokerage steubing said in a note on the ifo data
8048980 corporate earnings are going to fall this and next year steubing said adding
8048981 hopes that the european central bank might cut interest rates earlier than expected
8048982 the portfolio renewal has started and this should boost profitability said pohjola analyst hannu rauhala newer and more expensive cellphone models usually have higher profit margins than older and cheaper ones
8048983 offering a high and secure dividend yield are likely to perform well over the next year due to a greater focus on total returns in a market with limited scope for capital appreciation
8048984 most stock market investors have not had a good year so far one trader said
8048985 im not going to discuss what peter and i talk about apart from the economy and the obvious fact that treasurer mr wayne swan doesnt seem to have much idea of what hes doing with australias economy
8048986 i have a very high regard for peter im fortunate to be able to attend and address a dinner in his honour in melbourne on friday night this week and well have to just wait and see
8048987 in fact wed like to see it go a little bit further
8048988 we stand by our actions during the research and development process of the david babaii for wildaid hair care line and believe that 220 laboratories allegations are baseless and without any merit if we are formally served with the complaint we will vigorously defend this claim
8048989 and when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me shine on until tomorrow let it be
8048990 dr dre is mourning the loss of his son andre young jr
8048991 we havent decided where and as soon as we make that decision it will happen very quickly
8048992 michael is a wonderful human being he has brought me a profound love and support he is an amazing sounding board for me
8048993 i am the happiest now ive ever been in my life feeling more grounded than i ever have
8048994 for me theres only been one person and thats michael
8048995 i am very committed it is a very special time in my life i have a good feeling about the future
8048996 its going to be a hard act to follow the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn
8048997 remove the image that girls who become nuns are less attractive
8048998 do you think that all nuns are old and sad well that was over the nuns are primarily women and beauty is a gift from god
8048999 diminishes the role of nuns dedicated to god to missions to charity and to the most defenceless
8049000 this contest will serve to demonstrate that not only is there the beauty we see on television but there is a more discreet charm
8049001 draw attention to the beauty of religious life often little appreciated
8049002 they didnt ask for my opinion and i didnt give it
8049003 its going to be a hard act to follow the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn
8049004 youll never know which part of the internet youll need
8049005 we considered that because the ad had not explained the limitations viewers were likely to expect to be able to see all the content on a website normally accessible through a pc rather than just having the ability to reach the website
8049006 we concluded that the ad gave a misleading impression of the internet capabilities of the iphone
8049007 the ad must not be broadcast again in its current form
8049008 this is a major milestone for tomotherapy and in turn for cancer centers of all sizes
8049009 when i was younger i enjoyed books by both men and women
8049010 i generally enjoy a sock on both my left foot and my right

8049012 come on men white men men of my class are just better at this stuff
8049013 there are reports that four to five people have been killed in fresh violence the deaths are from yesterdays violence there is no fresh violence we have also clamped a curfew in kandhamal district to avoid any violence
8049014 saying naxals are behind the attack is totally misleading and orchestrated this is an attack by the agents of christian missionaries whose attempts at forcible conversions the swamiji countered
8049015 they tried and failed for seven times the eighth time they have succeeded a week before he was killed he had received an anonymous threat that said he would soon be killed though he lodged a formal complaint the officials did not do anything about it
8049016 the administration failed to ensure that the churches and christian institutions were attacked in return so this might be an act of revenge for that given the fact that lakshmanananda was actively combating forcible conversions in the region
8049017 they were very quick to do it probably because they wanted to ensure that communal violence does not break out but eventually they werent able to do that also
8049018 there is nothing that suggests that maosits may be involved though it is soon to say for sure they are not involved there have not been many incidents where they have attacked civilians even in such a case they would have killed the two home guards who were said to have been on duty at the time of attack

8049034 sometimes if you do too much the pain reasserts itself but i should be up and flying the flag by september 15
8049035 i mean i suppose its a little slower than i thought and as the doctor said to me the other day it wasnt an operation it was an excavation
8049036 i cant i suppose expect to be up and doing marathons straight away and it is only five weeks since the operation
8049037 im honored to be thought of as someone who can represent the state
8049038 im out and about and reaching out to constituents all the time
8049039 its going to be a hard act to follow the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn
8049040 this is not a debate about abortion this is about the baby bonus being misused and misapplied to women who do have terminations
8049041 clearly that is not the intention its not in keeping with the support of mainstream australians for the baby bonus
8049042 i think it is a very humane gesture from society to say you are going through enough already were not going to withhold the bonus
8049043 if there is any evidence of this occurring we will follow it up immediately
8049044 in my view if don bradman were playing today he would still have an average twice as good as any other batsman in the world
8049045 with the advances in bat technology and training imagine how good the don would be today it would be scary
8049046 he is by far the best batsman ever and would still be in todays game
8049047 his name and what he achieved its so far out of any players reach in his time or any player who has played since its almost like he played a different game to what were playing
8049048 during my trip to play for the world eleven against australia in 1972 73 don bradman came specially to meet me at adelaide airport
8049049 i consider it the happiest moment and great honour of my life i have preserved this picture and shall cherish it throughout my life
8049050 crews when they arrived a short period of time after they were told there was a child inside
8049051 there were initially five children ranging from age two up to 17 and four of them got out but unfortunately the two year old toddler did not
8049052 their grandmother made a lot of valiant efforts in getting the kids out she suffered burns and smoke inhalation trying to get the kids out
8049053 if this doesnt make you thirsty for malt liquor you must not have a serious drinking problem yet
8049054 if he was doing drugs if he had been drunk if he had gone out there and done what he did because he was pissed off at someone that would be a completely different story
8049055 rampage feels awful about the womans baby but he had nothing to do with it and the traffic incident occurred because he was very ill and not with him in control of his faculties
8049056 they got a group between eight and 12 of us together and theyd just start chanting and i would wake up during these sessions and see what was going on
8049057 youd pass out they spoke in tongues another element was called laying on hands that was the basis on which he would engage in physical contact
8049058 i know of people who have been contacted they said yes youre right but i havent told my wife what happened to me im not going to tell you guys police
8049059 few australians realise the extent and quality of their own wilderness
8049060 we just take whats here for granted not realising how rare it is
8049061 as the worlds last great wilderness areas disappear under pressure from human impact to have a continent with this much remaining wilderness intact is unusual and globally significant
8049062 if the land is left empty it will degrade over time thats why one of our focuses is to encourage the employment of indigenous rangers
8049063 we believe these should be full time jobs with the rangers having increased resources like four wheel drive vehicles and where necessary helicopters 700 is just not enough for these vast areas
8049064 by marrying overseas resources with local expertise we aim to make a big difference in looking after our outback
8049065 i am certainly not going to get into a pissing competition with the bourne fans you have the monarchy you have government and then you have the civil service the reason the civil service remains a non political organisation is that if the shit hits the fan like goose stepping nazi bastards you hope the civil service will turn around and go weve got it covered thats bond
8049066 we make family adventure films sadism for the entire family we always need to bear in mind that it is a family tradition
8049067 there will be european chauvinism judge corruption buying of brawn and brains and a strong dose of racism
8049068 let us hope that at the 2012 olympics britain is portrayed in a more recognisable way and that

8049073 twenty years have passed since julies murder investigations have come close to her killer however more information is needed
8049074 something might well turn up and i also wanted to show people that im still on the case at the least the person responsible for julies murder would have got cold shivers when they opened the newspaper this morning
8049075 it sounds like a lot of cars on the road for that time of the night and they were most likely returning from the weekend break we believe that up to 10 cars were involved which includes those that swerved to avoid the crash then drove off
8049076 we believe mohammed was trying to get away from the situation when he fell and hit his head on the pavement sustaining serious injuries
8049077 we are now trying to establish how he came to fall and hit his head in this way was he assaulted punched or pushed
8049078 this is a murder inquiry and we are seeking to establish to what extent race played a part in what happened
8049079 a police patrol car did stop at the kebab shop earlier in the evening and officers spoke to the owner but no crimes were being committed at that time
8049080 there were officers on the scene almost immediately after the trouble started as this is a highly patrolled area
8049081 i asked them to leave then noticed a police car pull up outside so i went over and spoke to the officers i asked them to keep an eye on the boys and they said they would then left
8049082 mohammed was a young student who was loved by his family friends and teachers he was a charming loving boy and there is nothing that can replace our loss all of those involved in committing this crime should be punished for this crime on a young innocent 16 year old boy
8049083 we thought it would be really amazing to capture these hookups as they happen
8049084 we wondered if members would actually be interested in having their private sex lives filmed
8049085 in that short time hundreds of guys applied and we just went from there
8049086 we are able to use the manhunt name and logo as well as have access to the manhunt members since both companies are owned by the same person
8049087 traditional porn is surreal and people are ready for real
8049088 a huge variety of promo materials video clips banners buttons hosted galleries and photos
8049089 the arrest is part of an ongoing investigation by lancashire constabulary and greater manchester counter terrorism unit
8049090 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
8049091 we will endeavour to carry out any searches as quickly as possible to minimise impact on the area concerned however inquiries of this nature are complex and may take time to resolve
8049092 i would like to thank local residents affected by the arrests for their cooperation and ask that they remain patient
8049093 if there is a real security issue people will always support and cooperate with the police but a lot of people are put in custody and are actually innocent and that has created anxiety in people to ask what is the investigation about
8049094 have people just gone on to the internet and read about things or are they actually planning on doing something
8049095 the local residents are quite happy with the way the police have treated the whole incident the asian officers make a difference when the asian officers are there and explain whats happening its more of a relief
8049096 our software has the ability to be transformed based on any criteria you may be looking for
8049097 our solution was designed with customization in mind from the graphical look of the site to the marketing backend

8049140 what i tell kids when i lecture in colleges is that porn is largely a microcosm of hollywood itself there were kids who wanted to do something goofy and crazy some were actors who wanted to go for an acting career like me and settled for this because acting was just a murderously difficult thing to get into its thousands of people chasing so few jobs with everyone driving a taxi working as a waiter

8049151 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8049152 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8049153 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
8049154 we couldnt find a good credit card processing company that didnt want to charge us 15 percent
8049155 we didnt want to use any of the third party billers such as dmr or ibill who were the biggest at that time so we got our own merchant account with that we ran our adult sites successfully for a while then the company gateway that we used for our credit card processing decided they wanted to get out of the adult business we wound up buying the rights to their software and we took over all of their adult merchants which numbered about 100 at the time after we did that for about a year we decided to develop our own software it was a particular need of the webmasters because the adult internet was really starting to grow
8049156 we didnt have a ton of money at the time to get it rolling we had to borrow some money from family but we started well with the 100 clients we inherited and soon after that many of those clients started to take off in terms of the volume they were doing video streaming and live feeds were just starting to come around and that really helped the adult internet to grow
8049157 weve always stuck to our guns in terms of never doing third party processing
8049158 all of our merchants always have had their own merchant accounts
8049159 but i think our biggest advantage lies in the personalities of our employees we have several employees who have been with us for years and theyre on a first name basis with so many of our clients because of that we really provide a lot of one on one service that you wont get with other companies whether a merchant is moving to us from a third party company or whether theyre starting from scratch we have our hands in their entire business as far as processing goes from getting their merchant account to deciding which banks are best for them well help them establish a corporation well help them set up their payment forms well help them get their affiliate programs running from end to end we have so much contact with our merchants because we know their success depends on how well we take care of them this is one of the reasons why we dont have an automated demo of our administration area we want to be one on one with every client having 60 employees can be tough to manage so it is important to have the right ones and we are very fortunate to have such a dedicated crew of professionals as part of our team
8049160 weve had to deal with visa and mastercard cracking down on chargeback ratios they began with a 5 percent chargeback ratio and then they reduced it to a 2 5 percent ratio we had to diversify and expand our fraud scrubbing and help our merchants change the way they do business in order to comply with the new ratio and keep their customers happy we have a good success rate in helping merchants to keep their chargebacks low and facilitating their cross sells and cross promotions
8049161 the high points are the relationships weve built over the years
8049162 we go to dozens of shows every year and weve built some incredible friendships of course the increase of business is a high point too but having the relationships within the industry has been the best reward
8049163 one of the nice things that has changed over the years
8049164 is that running under someone elses merchant account via third party processing used to be a good umbrella under which the merchant could hide a guy with high chargebacks and offset him with a guy who has really low chargebacks
8049165 our clients are comfortable with netbilling because they know were not taking the risks on other merchant chargebacks outside of losing that merchants income this gives our clients confidence in us because over the years so many third party processors have gone out of business and often theyve walked away with the merchants money

8049169 lucentis is an expensive drug costing more than 10 000 for each eye treated but that cost needs to be balanced against the likely cost savings age related macular degeneration results in reduced quality of life and increased risks of illness particularly in relation to accidents especially falls and psychological ill health
8049170 it has been estimated that the costs related to sight impairment for patients treated with lucentis are around 8 000 cheaper than for patients who receive best supportive care over a 10 year period
8049171 nices guidance will finally bring an end to a cruel postcode lottery
8049172 there is now nowhere left for pcts to hide we want them to implement nice guidance immediately rnib is also calling on hospitals to ensure they build capacity as a matter of urgency so they can save the sight of patients without further delay
8049173 at present we cannot detect differences in effects or risks although avastin may require fewer injections as it appears to last longer after each injection so the taxpayer may wish to question why they are paying so much more for lucentis when avastin appears to achieve the same outcome
8049174 it would have taken some time to unload the pallets which were spread over the verge the thieves would have had to have used a large vehicle to remove all the cheese police are hopeful that a passing motorist may have seen the theft
8049175 drug misuse in the armed forces will not be tolerated positive tests in the army over the last three years average around 0 8 compared with over 7 in civilian workplaces
8049176 this is the first time genetic testing has been recommended for a common disease
8049177 using cascade testing we should be able to move to the point where we have identified the majority of people with fh in the long term future we will be able to find them all
8049178 they can be offered semi skimmed milk it is crucially important no children should ever start smoking if they have fh if they smoke it multiplies their risk by two and a half fold almost without exception children will require treatment with statins by 18 but very small numbers of children will need treatment earlier

8049182 the only person who can officially open parliament will be determined by the outcome of the dialogue
8049183 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men fifteen other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured
8049184 this is matter of grave concern to the united nations i have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
8049185 the patience of the afghan people has run out we no longer can afford to see the killing of our children
8049186 i want to remind all parties engaged in the conflict that the protection of civilians must be their primary concern they must respect their duties under international humanitarian and human rights law to protect the people we are here to serve

8049205 and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
8049206 the shifting faith vote what it means for the election
8049207 the push for the democratic party is to have a new position on abortion
8049208 when you look at catholics and evangelicals you see that they agree with 80 percent of what mr obama says but theres this stumbling block with abortion
8049209 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters

8049219 courage because in spite of the demonisation of alba he has not hesitated to join a latin american integration project based on the thinking and spirit of our foremost heroes
8049220 today we are signing not only a fraternal pact of solidarity but also an integration project for latin america that stands out as an alternative to imperial hegemony and integrates progressive governments that are proposing a way out of oppressive imperialism
8049221 abject hand lickers of the yanquis there are many of them here as in the rest of latin america where the chief pitiyanquis are the owners of the media
8049222 an act of freedom because we are a free and sovereign people
8049223 this is a heroic act of independence and we need no ones permission to sign this commitment today we are taking a step towards becoming a government of the centre left and if anyone dislikes this well just remove the word centre and keep the second one
8049224 so thank you president ch vez for opening ways to freedom for latin americans because we were not born to be slaves nor to have masters
8049225 when i met with u s president george w bush no one called me an anti imperialist and the business community applauded me now that i am meeting with the impoverished peoples of the world they criticise me i hope they will retract their statements in the coming hours
8049226 who has told them they have an absolute right to privatise i invite them to participate in dialogue and to sign a truly national pact with a vision for the country
8049227 if the right finances worse things why shouldnt we mobilise our people
8049228 they promised us a bonus of 300 lempiras 15 dollars per person but we cant find the politician who is supposed to pay us although we know he was given the money
8049229 the financial content of the alba pact is unknown to date no one will talk about it there is no information only political pronouncements but the people deserve to know what the country is letting itself in for in terms of debt and future prospects
8049230 the prime goal of honduras joining alba is that the government wants money in the short term but the needs of government seldom coincide with the needs of the people this creates a delicate situation because ultimately it is the people who pay for the inappropriate expenses incurred by a government
8049231 there has been much speculation about alba but the truth is its a good alliance for the country in due course the transparency measures will be made known not everything can be accomplished in one day its necessary to be patient
8049232 therefore do not declare yourselves as being purified he knows best who has taqwa
8049233 none can reach the station of taqwaa until he possesses neither action nor words that can be exposed to his embarrassment either in this world or the hereafter
8049234 if he put all his thoughts and desires in his heart on a plate and then wandered around in the market he should not feel ashamed of anything there
8049235 the sign of muttaqi pious person is to bridle oneself from speaking just like one in ihraam bridles himself from speaking the muttaqi needs to be a scholar aalim of the sharee ah all of it otherwise he leaves taqwa without realising
8049236 from the completion of taqwa is that the slaves fears from his lord even with regards to things the weight of an atom
8049237 it is a road full of thorns one who walks it needs to have extreme patience
8049238 we met a people who loved it when it was said to them fear allaah the most high today you find that people only become annoyed at this
8049239 there is no connection between you and any nation the best country for you is the country which helps yo to acquire taqwa
8049240 they used to race towards goodness invoke us with hope and fear and they were devout to us

8049251 all of us are working together to support this important research to find a new treatment for als
8049252 we formed collaboration with canadian and u s sites to perform a study that will provide an answer quickly on whether lithium is effective in the treatment of als the study is designed to answer this key question definitively and with appropriate monitoring of safety

8049287 we are not just dealing with a system that is overwhelmed by overcrowding though overcrowding is a serious problem in some prisons we are also dealing with a system that is overwhelmed by numbers the proposal to add 7 500 to these three massive prisons is going simply to add another set of places where regimes will suffer because they will have to accommodate the needs of several different kinds of prisoners who we expect to be kept from one another
8049288 those present were overwhelmingly opposed to the proposal and believed there were other ways of deploying the huge sums of money involved that would make a far more effective contribution to the governments stated objectives
8049289 prisoners will be accommodated in small units capable of addressing their needs and offending behaviour they will be situated close to those areas which generate the greatest volume of offenders therefore ensuring that important family and other links can be maintained

8049326 whatever achievements that i have made i am always aware of how lucky i am there were people i knew who were smarter than me there were those who worked harder and perhaps were more dedicated
8049327 but for the lack of opportunity one of them would be standing here talking to you this evening my story is somewhat unique but in many ways it is not it is the overall promise that this nation has made that if a person works hard enough that they can make the most of their god given talents

8049356 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8049357 our church not only applauds but will do everything possible to support the national accord against organized violence

8049362 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8049363 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8049364 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8049365 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8049366 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8049367 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

8049381 there are serious issues that have been accumulating including ethnic problems in
8049382 i cannot predict whether there will be an immediate outbreak of all these problems after the olympics but there will be an outbreak if the government does not take steps to tackle the domestic problems
8049383 the pressure is building in the pressure cooker and theres no current avenue for it to be released i believe we will see many calls both inside and outside the party to put some sort of reforms on the agenda again

8049389 im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses what it has to do with is putting americans in houses and keeping them in their homes and thats what i know how to do

8049394 a chicken in every pot a car in every garage
8049395 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8049396 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8049397 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8049398 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8049399 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8049400 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8049401 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8049402 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8049403 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8049404 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8049405 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

8049410 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8049411 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8049412 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8049413 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8049414 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8049415 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8049416 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8049417 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8049418 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8049419 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8049420 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8049421 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8049422 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8049423 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8049424 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8049425 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8049426 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8049427 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

8049429 it is an interior journey that the celebrated austrian composer wrote in 1827 just one year before his premature death at the age of 31
8049430 when schubert brings a poetic text into his universe of sound he performs it through a melodic link that penetrates the soul with sweetness bringing the listener to feel his same nostalgic consummation the same call of that truth of the heart that goes beyond all rationality in this way a picture is born that speaks of genuine everyday life of nostalgia of introspection and of the future
8049431 the spontaneous and exuberant young schubert was successful in communicating to us here tonight as well what he lived and experienced he is worthy therefore of the universal acclaim that is given to this illustrious genius of music who honors european civilization and the great culture and spirituality of christian and catholic austria
8049432 comforted interiorly by the splendid musical experience of tonight we renew our gratitude to those who have promoted this concert and those who have magnificently performed it
8049433 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8049434 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

8049436 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8049437 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8049438 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8049439 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8049440 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8049441 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8049442 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8049443 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8049473 social security affects poverty among the elderly in two offsetting ways while it reduces poverty by providing income to retired persons it discourages private saving during the working years the net effect of this is increased poverty among the retired population to understand this conclusion it is important to compare the rate of return on taxes paid that is generated by social security to the rate of return people could receive on their private saving for those retiring in 2008 the average implicit real inflation adjusted rate of return on social security taxes paid was slightly below 3 percent and it is scheduled to decline to under 2 percent in the next forty years in contrast if people retiring in 2008 had invested the taxes they paid into social security in a balanced portfolio 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds they would have received a return of 5 5 percent

8049605 we were looking at the sustainability issues from the point of view of city systems how you deal with water open space systems the public realm we were looking at greening from the most experimental and perhaps unaffordable efforts at this point down to affordable green housing
8049606 its a tremendous leader theres the pennsylvania horticultural societys work with community an international leader another area is the work that the water department is doing with drainage issues and infrastructure a lot of really sensational things are going on in philadelphia philly is equal to other cities that have been more highly touted
8049607 because people get distracted philadelphia isnt alone many cities in this category are distressed industrial cities but philadelphia under the radar has been doing really remarkable things that are hidden they should be heralded
8049608 look at the work the center city district is doing in terms of advocating for greening
8049609 it was always that way but it didnt always use those words from day one the public realm parks streets open space systems has been an essential focus of city planners as they incorporate these systems the green infrastructure into the comprehensive plan
8049610 over time we tend to put old wine in new bottles thats happened very effectively in the green movement we dont even have to go back to the early 20th century you can go back to earth day the public owes it to its constituencies to create a public realm thats green and sustainable this public realm should not be disconnected little pieces of greenery but a whole system that should frame a region

8049623 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8049624 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8049625 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8049626 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8049627 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

8049629 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8049630 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8049631 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8049632 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8049633 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8049635 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8049636 the national lobby for atheists humanists freethinkers and other nontheistic americans with the unique mission of protecting their civil rights
8049637 kay hagan does not represent the values of this state she is a trojan horse for a long list of wacky left wing outside groups bent on policies that would horrify most north carolinians if they knew about it

8049643 there are more fans more media and more sponsors we want to help our athletes as best we can succeed off the golf course as well as on it
8049644 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8049645 this is an american tour it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8049646 clearly i want to win all the time but ive learned that sometimes its more advantageous to score as many points as possible and live to fight another day
8049647 my aim is still to win the world championship and you dont do that by ending up in the barriers after making an opportunistic move
8049648 in valencia we scored a very useful haul of points and ive actually come away from the weekend having extended my lead in the championship despite losing two points to felipe
8049649 im mentally strong enough to be able to deal with that and im more relaxed about it too
8049650 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8049651 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8049652 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8049653 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8049665 most of our novelists are preoccupied with life after working hours and below the waist it is hard to identify books by domestic authors that so directly address the ethical social and political dimensions of corporate life
8049666 these offerings will capture the broad imagination of the reading public as the many others that have preceded it have failed to do
8049667 the stock was bad last year and now it has been cut in half this year
8049668 im hoping for a rebound maybe to get me back some of these losses is last weeks one day rally a sign that it hit bottom
8049669 what cameras arent going to pick up are the words people used to agree with michelle
8049670 the neatest thing was being amongst the crowd every couple of seconds there would be someone yelling something positive
8049671 i did not know going in whether there would be unity
8049672 but as soon as i got boots on the ground i cant tell you how much energy there was and it was all positive

8049676 the shows will be the 37 year old star s last then the doc will regenerate into another actor
8049677 the long journey to this historic convention began on a cold winters night in the great state of iowa
8049678 im honored to join you more than seven months and 700 miles from the site of that first contest as we unite to make barack obama the next president of the united states
8049679 despite three tornados and 500 year flood levels countless americans rallied to help us
8049680 so on behalf of every iowan i want to say thank you for assisting us in our time of need
8049681 mccain has voted against tax credits for renewable energy eleven times and his only idea to solve our energy crisis is to keep doing what were doing as we watch prices go up
8049682 only barack obama has a detailed plan to give us the change we need lower energy prices and more green collar jobs
8049683 our choice is to stick with the status quo or move our country forward on energy the stakes couldnt be higher
8049684 the number one thing i learned last year is that the season is more of a marathon than a sprint while we got off to a good start and climbed up into the regional rankings we were unable to sustain that for the rest of the season hence we faltered down the stretch we have made excellent strides in the offseason to correct those mistakes with the work we have done in the weight room and the work we have done off the field with team bonding and mental preparation
8049685 last year we were starting a very young team as well we had a freshman goalkeeper who played every minute of every game in sean johnson while he was able to keep us in games at times we did not do what we could on the offensive end to keep the pressure off of him albeit we scored 24 goals last season the most we have scored since 2002 we also gave up 39 goals a point of emphasis in the offseason has been defending and learning how to play the first 10 minutes of the game and the last 10 minutes of the game
8049686 one of the main guys will be james georgeff who provided a lot of leadership for us and went on to play for the houston dynamo after his career here james was able to play in a variety of positions for us and he will be missed we have grown in terms of leadership and will be okay
8049687 ryan is a model citizen who takes care of his body very well off the field he was the schools male scholar athlete of the year so academically he gets it done on the field he is determined to score and make himself better and make the players around him better he is an excellent role model for our young players
8049688 the class is very well balanced and we brought in depth at every position we have added some of the best kids in the country who come in with the expectations of playing right away and i have those same expectations for them some of the notable players would be yaron bacher a transfer from longwood university kevan george from the concorde fire joe crowley from fc delco and bryan collier who played significant time for virginia tech last year
8049689 for the first time in their young lives they will be playing against primarily older players who have spent some time in the weight room which they are just starting to do the physical nature the speed of play is tremendously faster and the demands of the amount of games you have to play with a short turnaround will all be adjustments for them
8049690 i think we will have a few players in that regard joe crowley and yaron bacher are going to produce some goals for us kyle ellis one of our freshmen is coming along quite nicely in the preseason and then kevan george i think will score some goals out of midfield
8049691 he was able to get a taste of both victory and defeat last year and he learned the most important thing is to be consistent while he had some great games last year he also had some poor performances he has grown from those performances he had an outstanding spring with us he had an outstanding summer and thus far he has been very consistent this preseason
8049692 we have a number of players bryan collier matt heffernan camillo rendon and cameron cooksey who have come in and done very well solidifying the back line and we look for them to have a very productive year
8049693 the idea is always to prepare them for conference play and to face similar opponents to those you will play in the conference season in terms of the way that they defend the way that they attack and the talent of their teams it is always important by the time conference starts for the players to have seen everything they are going to see in conference
8049694 first and foremost you go with tulsa they are the defending champions and they only lose a couple of players off of their ncaa tournament team last year you give the nod to them i think smu will be as strong as they have been in years under the direction of new coach tim mcclements i also think memphis who had a good year last year is due for some good things
8049695 all three of them are unique in their own way with different attributes and they have all blended in tremendously with the players between james and mauricio they do a great job training and with the technical side of the game jim brings in the tactical knowledge of the game which is excellent in terms of in game adjustments and game preparation
8049696 the one thing we are doing differently this year as a team is we are going to work on goals in terms of three week clips and set our goals as we go the one mistake we made last year is we got a little ahead of ourselves in terms of goal setting for the entire year this year the mentality is going to be to work in segments and adjust our goals as we go making sure we are achieving them and constantly making ourselves better
8049697 i guarantee on the first night of the republican convention youre going to hear talk about

8049727 proud arizonan she wants to preserve one of the states great traditions
8049728 arizonans are rightly proud of our state the democratic governor said on the podium of the democratic national convention
8049729 arizonans are also proud of their political tradition from barry goldwater to mo udall to bruce babbitt she said
8049730 theres a pattern here barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president he lost bruce babbitt ran for president and he lost
8049731 speaking for myself and for at least this coming election this is one arizona tradition id like to see continue
8049732 something positive here about here fellow arizonan sen john mccain the republican partys candidate for president
8049733 you know joe biden is an impenetrable thicket of words romney replied in an interview on cnns
8049734 i cant imagine anybody is ready to debate joe biden
8049735 senator biden seems to be an impenetrable thicket of words so i cant imagine having to go up against him i think that almost anybody that goes up against him would find themselves outspoken
8049736 but i dont have anything for you the vp front romney told both cavuto and cnns wolf blitzer
8049737 im not sure when john mccain will make his announcement and who it will be but i have confidence in his instincts hes proven time and time again that those instincts serve him well and i think hell make a wise choice
8049738 out of the mainstream at least in my view of conservative republican thoughts
8049739 well i think that the mccain campaign would be happy if they played that ad with my comments because it just points out something that well i think everybody in america knows and that is that john mccain is his own man that hes not a carbon copy of any other republican including president bush romney said in response to the clips
8049740 and this whole line of attack that hes a continuation of bush just isnt going to fly
8049741 you know in a debate we talk about why were the right person to win and the other guy isnt romney said
8049742 but one thing i never said about john mccain so far as i can recall i never said he wasnt qualified
8049743 when we walked out i whispered down and said ive got a surprise for you
8049744 we democrats are giving america a wake up call kucinich the fervently anti war democratic congressman from ohio who twice has waged campaigns for his partys presidential nomination said at the democratic national convention today

8049751 up with health care for all up with education for all up with home ownership up with guaranteed retirement benefits up with peace up with prosperity
8049752 up with the democratic party and here kucinich finally reluctantly said it

8049806 opening with the perfect foreshadowing device a summary of the legend of st valentine author jamieson wolf sets the reader up for an erotic supernatural romp thats going to have meaning the story valentine is fast paced and well told and offers not just a quick and lusty romance but a storyline that makes the reader sympathize with the characters plights and care about the point wolf wishes to make
8049807 i like this writers way with words valentine is an amazing book that everyone shoul read he builds a good plot and develops his characters well i would give it 5 stars out of 5
8049808 jamieson wolf writes with some of the strongest emotion i have found in ages his passion is reminiscent of that seen in the works of shakespeare and others of that time period his characters love deeply and without restraint overcoming every obstacle placed before them this is truly a tale for all those who believe love has no boundaries
8049809 jamieson wolf is what i would call a fabulous storyteller he dreams up or gets visited by great characters and he paints them vividly when he writes he gets fantastic story ideas and pounds them out in a way that makes you lean in toward the computer screen or flip through the physical pages faster and faster to see whats happening to these people next
8049810 this book is great this is a must read book for any body who loves ghost fantasy supernatural fun a surprise around every corner awaits the reader i am so happy to have purchased this book and add it to my own family library we just have to wait until jamieson wolf gets another fun book out there for all of us to read well worth it for your own fun reading and for your book collection a five star rating from me love it

8049813 the formation of a bar may be the final important act in the evolution of a spiral galaxy galaxies are thought to build themselves up through mergers with other galaxies after settling down the only other dramatic way for galaxies to evolve is through the action of bars
8049814 they are forming mostly in the small low mass galaxies we know that evolution is generally faster for more massive galaxies they form their stars early and fast and then fade into red disks low mass galaxies were also known to form more slowly but now we see that they also made their bars slower
8049815 they pull stars and gas out of their normal circular orbits into the central regions perhaps even funneling gas to the central supermassive black hole without this fueling the black holes would be starved and the central regions of galaxies devoid of young stars
8049816 understanding how this occurred in the most distant galaxies will eventually shed light on how it occurred here in our own backyard

8049820 strictly speaking here is the main idea squeeze a drop of water between the thumb and the index finger and then move the two fingers away from each other the drop takes the form of a small liquid fiber stretch still a little more and this fiber breaks in two daughter drops under the influence of surface stresses in order to minimize the energy associated with the increase in water air surface due to stretching
8049821 the radius and the length of induced fibers being respectively micrometric and millimetric these results allow us to advance a microfluidic approach of self adapted optical guiding while proposing an original answer to the stabilization of liquid columns a problem studied for the first time by rayleigh more than one hundred years ago

8049823 i believed that preserved soft tissues had been found but i had to change my opinion you have to go where the science leads and the science leads me to believe that this is bacterial biofilm
8049824 we cracked open a lot of bones and spent hundreds of hours on an electron microscope examining them
8049825 if you could dissolve the bucket away youd find soft squishy material in the shape of the bucket and thats the slime the same is true for dinosaur bones if you dissolve away the bone whats left is biofilm in the shape of vascular canals
8049826 kaye did not offer any explanation for how biofilm proteins from dinosaur could cluster with chicken while biofilm from mammoth and mastodon cluster with elephant

8049844 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
8049845 detection of liquid ethane in ontario lacus confirms a long held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on titan
8049846 it seems to have partially evaporated and that makes sense because the south pole has just gone through summer the maximum evaporation will have already occurred or is in the process of occurring theres still a lot of liquid left in that lake and we dont think its going to evaporate much further
8049847 liquid ethane methane mix would be less viscous than water if riffling your fingers through it you wouldnt feel as much resistance
8049848 a single step chemical process has been pursued for decades with little success this research breakthrough represents a potentially disruptive step forward in the cost effective processing of these important materials
8049849 such unusually shaped particles should prove valuable in the processing of anisotropic magnets that are highly sought in many dod and commercial applications and are anticipated to lead to lighter and more energy efficient end products
8049850 the development of stable samarium cobalt nanoparticles using this one step chemical synthesis method may motivate more scientists and engineers to work on the development of next generation magnets
8049851 this work represents the most promising advance in rare earth permanent magnet processing in many years i expect it to revitalize international interest in the development of this important class of engineering materials
8049852 its a surprise to find this on what we thought was an astronomical instrument
8049853 its not an instrument of pure science however it does demonstrate the relationship of cosmic time to human time
8049854 the first clues that suggested a link with the ancient cycle of greek games came when the word nemea was read near a small subsidiary dial on the mechanism
8049855 its not a calendar of the sort that astronomers would use its more of a regional calendar that belonged to certain greek cities such as corinth
8049856 theres more work we need to do on this i think
8049857 overall these findings show that their brains are not working properly to start with and the metabolic impairment gets worse over time however we dont know why or how this happens our study shows for the first time that individuals with an alzheimers disease affected mother may be at increased risk for developing alzheimers disease themselves because their brains are not utilizing glucose in an effective way
8049858 at this point we can only speculate that genes that are maternally inherited may alter brain metabolism we need to follow subjects for longer time periods to ascertain whether the metabolic reductions are in fact forerunning cognitive deterioration
8049859 one could collect the children of mothers with alzheimers disease divide them into a placebo group and a drug test group and follow them with neuropsych tests and brain scans to see whether the group receiving the drug had delayed onset or prevention
8049860 this is significant because it broadens the utility of imaging as a tool for detecting the disease early not simply in those with a specific form of genetic risk now it needs to be paired with clinical trials for new approaches for prevention

8049870 it is becoming increasingly clear that seiu leaders often see students and campus workers as little more than pawns to use as they see fit
8049871 seiu has sought to maneuver these pawns in a way that brings new members and dues into the union in the short term but keeps workers in poverty and actually hurts our collective efforts to help unions grow at a massive scale

8049880 the best part about your audio horoscopes is that they pat me on the head and kick me in the ass at the same time
8049881 your audio oracles go beyond helping me find the truth they inspire me to find the wild truth
8049882 i love you as a glad bird loves the freedom of its wings i love you as i love the first lily of spring exploding with clear fragrance in the moonlight i love you as i love the swell and hush of a low melody that brings the past to life again i love you as i love the tone of a soft breathing dawn whose soul has awaken for me alone

8049889 the virus is truly complex and has many tricks up its sleeve weve discovered the weak spot of hiv the virus needs at least one constant region and that is the essence of calling it the achilles heel
8049890 what we already have in our hand are the abzymes that we could be infusing into the human subjects with hiv infection essentially to move the virus
8049891 clinical trials are very expensive that is the worry of the researcher this is what nightmares are made of that after 30 years of work you find it doesnt work this is the holy grail of hiv research to develop a preventative vaccine
8049892 if we can get the viral loads down to a manageable level that will preclude the need for these conventional drugs

8049926 the orcs have the citadel completely surrounded even with my century the battle will be long and end with the failure of our mission
8049927 if we can get these men inside the citadel they could hold it for months surely if we fight our way through we would only lose a few of them
8049928 fight our way through certainly we could launch an assault upon the orc lines so fierce they would crumble we would take many orc lives this day indeed and maybe break the entire army but i would never allow this assault to take place my lady
8049929 those are our people down there dying and waiting for us why give up the chance to deliver that promise
8049930 because the orcs thrive on fighting if we launch a huge assault they would not be devastated like most foes but enjoy the fight for a long time maybe after a few hours they would run but i would lose many triarii in the fight if you want to have an army that would simply waste lives without thinking maybe you should have brought a few regiments of hastati but i have only so many troops and i will not see them wasted on attrition
8049931 very well scipio we cannot leave them what must we do
8049932 the citadel has one major opening which is so packed with orcs that we can never get through so we need to draw the orcs away i have shoulder mounted cannons so i would put them to the east behind the orcs line of retreat i would also put twenty other triarii out there to the north and south they would launch raids and draw the orcs away from the citadel i would have also placed several squads around the area of their choosing and have them all launch coordinated raids as to draw the orcs out and make them thinner and when the orcs have spread out i would launch the assault smashing and cutting through the orc lines like a knife through air using the cannons i would blow a hole in one of the walls and have the triarii rally there then i would hold the break with the triarii where the numbers of the enemy mean nothing and i have my men at the point of decision
8049933 youd destroy the defences that is the opposite of why we are here
8049934 only a part of it and the orcs would focus on that part only being rather single minded creatures besides we are not here to make sure the citadel is well decorated we are here to hold it and drive off the orcs the great orc will be at the forefront of the assault on the break and when i cast his headless body back down to the savages they will break and run i will then take my forces and make sure that no orc tries to rally them under his banner you can stay here with the chosens fist
8049935 judging by your constant concern for these people i would have guessed otherwise
8049936 and you cant just up and leave my command when you want to
8049937 inquisitor this is the first time you have dealt with the triarii isnt it
8049938 the triarii are not bound to your inquisition we have our own mission given to us by chorus and we work with your people because we choose to not because we have to is that clear
8049939 well grand master let us see what a century of the best soldiers in the empire can do against thousands
8049940 what particular era are you from it looks like the knights templar
8049941 you use the archaic term its correct if old few of the younger inquisitors can tell an era but the century i command are of the knights templar indeed
8049942 indeed i wear the cross on my chest if you were but to look
8049943 i see how old are you to be in command of an entire century
8049944 i am only five centuries old young among most masters of the knights templar but older than most humans i wager
8049945 if a single human soul dies to a monster all the orcs in kera couldnt be enough to avenge it i didnt come in time but i suppose this is a victory of sorts
8049946 not at all my lady the chosen saw fit to bless me with a second
8049947 stand please you are injured and i saw how you and your men held this citadel against such numbers i will ask the emperor to honour you all for it if you dont mind i would like to rest
8049948 la pol tica se nutre de realidades y hay que hacer lo que se pueda
8049949 every time we lose im concerned because if youre losing youre generally not playing the way you need to play to win the game so we havent done that
8049950 those are the little things im saying that to you edwards as a player and young leader on your team
8049951 you have a veteran 1 300 yards last year fumbling on the two yard line that cant happen
8049952 you cant go three and out on offense and blow coverage assignments as a starting defensive unit you have a guy in domenik hixon who is not going to be the poster boy for receivers in anybodys fantasy football pool but here he is with two touchdowns as well as a punt return for a touchdown these are self inflicted negatives these are things we cant do if we do do them we wont be what everybody expects us to be this year
8049953 chud calls them sins self inflicted negatives theres a long list i think the list might be a little too long but he does have a couple quality points one is you cant beat yourself that was our problem last year we had too many situations where we beat ourselves
8049954 ho visto un napoli molto maturo le gare di intertoto potevano sembrare facili ma non lo sono state contro il vllaznia in albania il napoli ha giocato una gara perfetta la partita di ritorno e una formalita perch il napoli ormai ha ipotecato il passaggio in uefa i ragazzi si sono meritati questo traguardo
8049955 denis mi ha fatto unottima impressione rinaudo lo conoscevamo rinaudo ha bisogno di un po di tempo per entrare in forma mentre denis non si e mai fermato el tanque e un ottimo giocatore fa reparto da solo maggio poi lo conosciamo tutti e un grandissimo giocatore puo dare il suo contributo
8049956 dal mio punto di vista il napoli deve puntare su vitale questo ragazzo ha dimostrato di avere carattere e giovane ma ha personalita di fronte al pubblico partenopeo non ha sfigurato dopo un po di anni e venuto fuori un bel giocatore dal vivaio
8049957 credo proprio di si soprattutto pi maturato tantissimo negli anni di c e stato molto utile ed ora e cresciuto il napoli ha fatto bene a tenerselo vedo un napoli migliorato con una panchina piu lunga non dobbiamo dimenticarci infatti che questo gruppo dovra affrontare tre competizioni
8049958 zalayeta ancora in fase di recupero per questo credo che si punter sulla coppia lavezzi denis sar reja a scegliere i giocatori giusti in base alle competizioni che si andranno ad affrontare il napoli e messo bene in avanti e a centrocampo la conferma di blasi e stata fondamentale
8049959 dispiace per la scomparsa di franco sensi perche era una persona eccezionale la roma vista nella supercoppa e apparsa abbastanza in palla ci sono alcuni giocatori sotto tono e il napoli essendo partito prima in ritiro potra dire la propria bisogna andare a roma per giocare a viso aperto altrimenti si rischiano brutte figure credo che il napoli possa venir fuori indenne dallolimpico
8049960 blasi maggio santacroce e paolo cannavaro possono ambire alla nazionale sono convinto che lippi e ciro ferrara li hanno sotto osservazione paolo cannavaro e maturato molto il reparto difensivo della nazionale e quello da ristrutturare anche se a lippi piace lusato sicuro con fabio cannavaro e materazzi credo che i tifosi del napoli daranno una mano importante ai ragazzi anche in chiave nazionale
8049961 hamsik e incontrollabile quando sta bene e devastante mi auguro che possa fare la differenza
8049962 ai tifosi del napoli dico che bisogna vincere il campionato sulle tribune dando un esempio di fair play come e accaduto per tanti anni

8049997 i usually challenged him and talked junk he got mad a few times
8049998 i wouldnt hit him the way to test somebodys humbleness or where they are mentally is to challenge them verbally to see how they can handle people coming at them and how they handle pressure in a game a lot of guys talk junk you have to be able to just take it in stride and keep your cool at first he had a little trouble with it but hes fine now
