1810000 i talked to a woman at the mission who has been waiting seven months for a place to live for herself and her three children
1810001 i was so green to doing a recording session by myself
1810002 my brother asked what was wrong and i told him i was scared
1810003 i have never been a means to an end just nothing more than a crappy boyfriend
1810004 man how many marriages last that long twenty years and six months to the date it hurt but we did a lot of stuff it was hard because i was used to the nuances that different people would bring in a matter of theory or a horn voicing or even a scolding like hey that chord doesnt match with that melody bubba and i had to resolve those issues by myself
1810005 theres actually a photo of them as you walk into the mariachi bar at mi tierra
1810006 i was almost canning the idea of having a band there for a minute
1810007 i was thinking oh my god this is all too much for me now i want to retire but my friend scrote is the one who kind of got me going again and we just tried different rosters and thats gone fairly well theres a part of me that thinks i dont want to bother people and theres times people get their feelings hurt if i dont call but it seems like theres a little core pulling together
1810008 what im thinking about with scrote is something else to fuck up the sound of my voice
1810009 the first thing he did was come in with a cheap ass mic and say come on sing into that and it sounds cool so the new tracks im doing right now for the next project are really neat sounding theyve got a different vibe im digging that
1810010 dont let any new people into the club were a full house now
1810011 tickets bought with their credit cards could be picked up by their kids at the door
1810012 we think there is a real gap in the marketplace here in portland and in oregon in general
1810013 it was a great job but no one else wanted to do it i mean all you had to do was yell at the kids spin em around make em throw up and then hose it all off and then go smoke a cigarette i made that job desirable
1810014 he called me up at 10 in the morning telling me the cops are after him and he needed to find a place to stay
1810015 i found him a place in beaverton some dudes house who was still living with his parents
1810016 weve been trying to get him to come out and play ever since we bought slabtown
1810017 but he had a lot of paranoia issues because of some unfinished legal business
1810018 its been about five years since ive even touched that stuff
1810019 but its stirring up all the really good memories instead of the bad knowing that those songs are going to be heard again
1810020 some of my favorite memories are when all of my friends would come and visit me at the amusement park and go nuts and get drunk on the rides or the basement of former 10 4 backdoor bandmates sara hot stix and joe pestilences house everything you could imagine and more happened in that basement you couldnt wash the walls down there youd have to burn the whole fucking house down
1810021 when i told him i was going out for ice cream he said what are you six
1810022 we always came out feeling like it never sounded like us
1810023 it was never what we felt like it was when we had that live vibe wed never get that feeling
1810024 they dont have the most time to spend on it
1810025 we were able to get the parts arranged the way we wanted and tweak some of the songs
1810026 recording ourselves allowed us more freedom to sort of eff around
1810027 weve become more focused on the technical aspect of things spending more time on the songs trying to keep them from all sounding the same
1810028 you dont always gotta be pouting with your fists clenched
1810029 its what we sound like or what we hope to sound like im really happy
1810030 wed remake the band every time wed find a new drummer
1810031 at that point we said no more we tried a drum machine for a while but that sounded a little too canned i knew how to play drums so i decided to do it
1810032 kate and i were listening to the velvet underground and the beatles ad nauseum
1810033 our entire music collection had been stolen in portland when we got down here dan worked at off the record so we started rebuilding our collection we were pretty permeable then
1810034 if youd asked me a couple years ago i wouldve said yes
1810035 i think we started enjoying music together a lot more in the past year and a half i think something broke
1810036 es que es de piel y te quedas pegado no vas a estar c moda que da mucho calor
1810037 oil prices continue to come down but its unclear what will happen with the prices
1810038 but at the same time u s citizens are making decisions that will carry forward regardless of how fuel prices fluctuate
1810039 weve seen a really dramatic change in buying patterns for different automobiles with big shifts away from suvs pickup trucks and other larger less fuel efficient cars for smaller cars for hybrids
1810040 and when people do that they are going to own that car for a number of years
1810041 unfortunately this sort of behavior by mexican military personnel has been going on for years
1810042 they are never held accountable and the united states government will undoubtedly brush this off as another case of oh well they didnt know they were in the united states
1810043 it is fortunate that this incident didnt end in a very ugly gunfight
1810044 piss off with your mobile phone you moron youre blocking my view of the stage
1810045 anything below that needs a lot of work and there is nothing in red lodge for under 100 000
1810046 criminalization of copyright infringement granting law enforcement the powers to perform criminal investigation arrests and pursue criminal citations or prosecution of suspects who may have infringed on copyright
1810047 it is incomprehensible to some copyright owners that the more sense that copyright makes to the consumers of copyright material or to put it in economic terms the greater its economic value or utility to consumers the more users value copyright material and respect the rights of copyright owners
1810048 that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement it is not a dream of motor cars and high wages merely but a dream of social order in which each man and each woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable and be recognized by others for what they are regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position
1810049 a smaller community where we could offer honest solid dentistry a lot of the dentistry being offered in larger urban areas is becoming more and more cosmetic and commercialized we werent interested in that kind of practice
1810050 were more interested in health care and prevention of disease
1810051 we wanted to go to a place where we could make a bigger difference have a bigger impact taking care of what people need as opposed to just cosmetic procedures that people want probably more importantly we wanted a place that is good to raise kids in
1810052 this was half a business decision but even more so a quality of life decision both for mason and to be close to what we like to do
1810053 we wanted to live some place close to hiking fishing and camping where we could slow down and take some of the stress out of our lives
1810054 they didnt have any rentals here so we lived in a hotel for a long time
1810055 then we made a friend who actually has an apartment under his house so weve stayed the last few days with him we just purchased a small house a little two bedroom place one of the cheaper houses in town
1810056 theres this shift in california where general dentists refer everything to specialists and then concentrate on cosmetics
1810057 we believe that any general dentist should be able to perform good cosmetic dentistry along with anything else they feel comfortable with if you are trained and proficient at what you do general dentistry can definitely cover those other disciplines
1810058 i received extra training with endodontics root canals periodontics gum surgeries and prosthodontics dentures
1810059 my experience with medically compromised patients was a big advantage of the hospital training in the future i think our practice will include more on the surgical end of things the types of procedures patients in the past may have had to travel to bigger towns to receive molar root canals surgical extractions gum surgery implants and implant restorations whether its with dentures or crowns at some point we may even go and visit patients at their nursing homes at least to do screenings and to see if somebody actually needs anything
1810060 i have pediatrics dentist training and i like to work with kids
1810061 i also did a lot of community work in san francisco and plan to do community service outreach here we plan to establish a true family practice seeing patients of all ages and all dental needs also we accept all insurances
1810062 we wanted to go someplace where we could practice the way that we like to at the pace that we want to
1810063 if we dont work as much or make as much money living here i dont care
1810064 i gave my all at west ham and enjoyed my time there but the decision is the best for the both of us
1810065 now i will take my time to consider my football future
1810066 we are in the process of setting you up as a vendor
1810067 in meinen augen war der smarte frank bsirske schon immer ein besonders wiederlicher und verlogener
1810068 i will remain with manchester united for at least another year
1810069 sir alex ferguson heard my arguments i heard his and in fact it was settled that the best for both parties would be for me to stay
1810070 therefore i can confirm that next season i will play for manchester united
1810071 before rumours emerge saying that i will play against my will i want to make this clear whoever says or writes that is lying
1810072 i will play for manchester with all my heart and soul i will fight and honour that shirt with the same commitment and dedication as always
1810073 i was the one who publicly expressed my desire to go to real madrid i ended up being even involuntarily responsible for the poor relationship between the two clubs
1810074 i knew real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very high offer to manchester united
1810075 my desire was for some time that manchester had accepted my transfer to madrid
1810076 i make a big presence on the field and i make my opponents feel it the big flo
1810077 felix the cat the wonderful wonderful cat he walks so big talks so big thats all i know
1810078 felix the cat i call him felix my dog jones
1810079 pacman that goes a long way with the video game and um thats one of the best
1810080 pacman oh ok he talks all day his fits perfect
1810081 if youre noodle then you could be spaghetti angel hair i want to be spaghetti angel hair sounds kinda soft and feminine and thats not me
1810082 tank i dont even know his real name its just tank
1810083 the club will be deducted 17 points for the 2008 09 season this takes into account the fact that this is the clubs second insolvency event in recent seasons
1810084 the club must provide a legal waiver indicating they will not challenge or appeal this decision
1810085 the club must undertake to return to rotherham within four years and provide an irrevocable bond of 750 000
1810086 this will be forfeited if the club fail to return within that timeframe as will the clubs membership of the football league
1810087 the club must pay unsecured creditors the amount offered at the time of the cva hearing
1810088 we are disappointed by the decision having spent more than two years working diligently on a project which would not only provide everton football club with a new home but also regenerate kirkby we had hoped to avoid a government call in
1810089 indeed it was only in june that knowsley borough councils planning committee voted by a majority of 20 1 to grant planning permission
1810090 we shall now engage in detailed discussions with our development partners kbc and tesco to assess what options are open to us
1810091 it is important to stress that this decision does not spell the end of the destination kirkby project but it will self evidently precipitate a period of reflection assessment and re evaluation
1810092 a ground move is certainly crucial to the economic future of everton i have said it a million times that i love goodison park but we have to move for economic and financial reasons
1810093 we have to get more income into the club to begin to compete with those clubs i have been talking about
1810094 that is the reason we have been contemplating it and the truth is we have had enormous support from knowsley council from tesco and we have not had that from liverpool council that is the bottom line of it
1810095 the economics of the premier league are becoming more and more demanding
1810096 it is important everton keeps pace with the spending powers of our peer group and our rivals in the league
1810097 to do that a new stadium is critical and the strongest option available to the club in terms of affordability and what it can do for us in a business sense is the one at kirkby
1810098 while goodison is a wonderful old stadium it does constrain the club financially
1810099 this is the single biggest opportunity which the club faces and i recognise it is a hugely emotive issue
1810100 we are extremely disappointed as a public inquiry will delay the development indeed this delay in the current economic climate places the entire project in jeopardy
1810101 from all of the consultation we have carried out we believe that the majority of local residents are in favour of transforming kirkby the local elections in may this year gave the council a clear mandate to continue with the scheme
1810102 we have searched long and hard for years to attract the right investor to kirkby and this scheme cannot be equalled
1810103 at this point in time there is no plan b for kirkby and no plan b for everton football club
1810104 we will do all we can to keep the scheme alive and make sure the future of kirkby is not put at risk
1810105 it was disappointing that some neighbouring authorities continued to object despite the improvements they requested having been made to the scheme
1810106 their continued objections therefore could only have been for political reasons
1810107 it is particularly regrettable that some community leaders in merseyside seemed unable to do the right thing for the merseyside sub region which was to put aside their personal views in relation to everton football club
1810108 you look at guys who have not won majors who at my age or even past my age who are playing well this year they can break through
1810109 if you look at the world rankings from fifth to 20th there are a lot of guys very bunched and playing very good golf
1810110 so there are so many guys that can win and i feel its exciting times
1810111 you guys can talk about players that you would never talk about if tiger was around so i think for the whole game you can kind of educate the public about more players too
1810112 we dont have the best player in the world here right now and i think that will be remembered for a very short amount of time and all due respect to tiger
1810113 i think tiger will agree with me the game of golf is bigger and will be bigger than any player
1810114 weve gone through all the generations from the walter hagens the ben hogans the byron nelsons the nicklauss the players and we end up now with tiger woods so the game will move on and keep evolving
1810115 although we will miss him here and im sure there will be some talk about it but it will definitely not be on the headline
1810116 if you look at padraig harringtons win at the open championship the great golf shot he hit into 17 18 the way he played the final five six holes is just phenomenal golf
1810117 so im actually quite proud people havent really talked down on the champions so far because they have played some excellent golf and the golf has been at a very high standard
1810118 again the game of golf is bigger than most of the guys or anybody
1810119 playing very similar clubs into the par fours than we did in 96
1810120 obviously technology has moved on since then so i think the changes they have made has been good because we are hitting as i say the same kind of clubs in there
1810121 the greens are exactly the same these are probably some of the toughest greens youll ever see and a lot of slope a lot of undulation you get above the hole very fast and then obviously the rough is up
1810122 so the whole golf course really feels and plays like a major should be so i think were in for a tough week but a very fair week
1810123 i would love for an american to win this tournament
1810124 i dont know if hell hope me to do well but im hoping to do well myself and put myself in a good position to make the team
1810125 obviously its one of my goals and im working on it to hopefully make it
1810126 i do look i do look to see how i am doing i dont get you know in the way of saying okay if i finish third here ill get this many points and then if this guy finishes that no
1810127 i like to see where i am standing and how close i am of making the team and i know if i have a good week ill get myself back in and if i dont ill have to keep working
1810128 thats pretty much the only way i look at it
1810129 im going to play barclays and boston so those will be my two my last two chances to get on to the team
1810130 i hope that i dont have to get to those two but you know at least i still have two more this one and two more chances to try to get in it
1810131 obviously the look of the course is pretty much the same
1810132 its a lot tougher than it was at the ryder cup the rough is thicker they have added some good length bunkers are a little bit deeper
1810133 so its definitely playing tougher than it was at the ryder cup
1810134 this has given me confidence i handled the pressure good and i feel very comfortable playing in the last group
1810135 i have never been one to give up out there and ive got a routine im going through and nothing phases me too much i hit some nice shots under pressure over the last few holes
1810136 its a new highly challenging difficulty mode exclusive to the playstation 3 version of bioshock
1810137 when we designed the original three difficulty modes of bioshock we tried to define a spectrum encompasses as much of the shooter audience as we could balanced as optimally as possible
1810138 besides that a lot of bioshocks game mechanics become more interesting when the player is under pressure to use their abilities in a creative and efficient manner
1810139 you wont be blazing through spaces you wont be flush with resources every fight is a decisive life or death struggle
1810140 theyll probably tell you to open an account under a new email address
1810141 the countdown has officially begun mark your calendars september 18th is the day of reckoning for the last three years the entire team at mythic has poured their hearts into making warhammer online the next great mmorpg we are so excited to open up this world and share it with the fans that will live in it quest in it go to war in it and make it come alive

1810143 attempted to defend an unconstitutional law restricting the constitutional rights of video game publishers developers and consumers
1810144 it is unfortunate that the state is stubbornly pursuing an appeal that is likely to lead to even more court awarded fees
1810145 were hopeful to be able to preserve and restore yellowstone bison outside the yellowstone ecosystem
1810146 in detroit there were 41 79 murders per 100 000 people in 2002 this is alarmingly way above the national average rate of 5 6 for the same year
1810147 well large amounts of evidence show that the decrease in violent crime which reached its lowest rate in 2005 can be directly attributed to the national legalization of abortion in 1973
1810148 i dont want to conclude that theres a problem but i have an obligation to donors and the taxpayers to find out more
1810149 this is not a crusade against ministries it has nothing to do with doctrine its only the enforcement of the law and its no different than the investigations weve been doing on non profits the last five years
1810150 if you give this money to our ministry were going to comply with the irs

1810159 i heard on the radio today that the soul put an end to the philly curse
1810160 there are 14 guys that played in the mann cup last season and another three rookies who played in the minto cup so there is lots of playoff experience
1810161 we think we can up the tempo of our game in the playoffs and have some success
1810162 we have a very close dressing room that is loose but confident
1810163 we finished in third and got the spot we wanted
1810164 they coquitlam have good veteran d players but we match up pretty well with them
1810165 i heard on the radio today that the soul put an end to the philly curse
1810166 i can probably fix anything that goes wrong with this

1810210 plain and simple she needed the cans because she ran out of gas she had a faulty gas gauge simple as that
1810211 theres no reason to bring the theft up previously casey had used the gas cans theres other peoples fingerprints on them besides us and thats what theyre looking at
1810212 she was hesitant about letting me get in the car and i said well ive got an extra key ill just go get it she was adamant about that
1810213 she didnt want him to know the gas cans were in the trunk she thought she could put them back and leave him a note of apology
1810214 there was no caylee in the back of the car there was nothing else in the back of the car except the normal stuff
1810215 this is the first they were ever told that caylee might be a grandchild of theirs
1810216 they became interested in that because thats all they would have left of their son who died at age 20 this is a real surprise to them i think another news station broke the story to them as a hello big surprise at their front door and that was a very shocking event for them since that time theyve gotten unwanted media attention
1810217 i just found out that they did charge casey formally today which is a good thing because look what they charged her with to me that is actually almost a victory for the home team today because they obviously have not found anything
1810218 every moment that passes i die a little bit inside every day not having her
1810219 she is a part of me and without her i feel incomplete
1810220 we bring caylee and everybody is going to know and casey is not going to be this monster that everybody has painted her out to be
1810221 as much as i wanted to see casey today and visit with her i couldnt
1810222 i did get to meet with her attorney and he is going to be able to speak with her in private with my thoughts and the things that i want to talk to her about
1810223 i had all of these mixed feeling about should i go or shouldnt i go
1810224 bottom line was that i made the decision this morning that i wasnt going to go
1810225 it was a meeting at our request just to touch base with them and see where we are all at
1810226 we had to take some tough decisions we got through it
1810227 we are going to continue to look at our structure and evaluate that versus the external environment
1810228 we always continue to look at our structure and what it means to be competitive
1810229 we are very excited that trojan professional services has built an interface with our fastattach system which will streamline the processing of electronic claims with attachments for our dental provider and our payor clients

1810241 this project demonstrated the feasibility of implementing specific strategies for improving preventive and developmental care for young children in a wide variety of practices
1810242 it also confirmed the usefulness of a modified learning collaborative in achieving these results the model may be useful for disseminating office system improvements to other settings that provide care for young children
1810243 learning from participants which sequence of components was easiest and most useful to implement will be useful in future efforts to improve office systems for preventive and developmental care
1810244 anecdotal feedback suggests that participation in this collaborative effort may have had a generalized effect on communication within the practice and may have contributed to a redistribution of responsibility for ensuring that children received appropriate developmental services

1810314 the chinese are clearly hyper focused and hyper worried about security and this is something theyve been working on for at least three or four years by now
1810315 we have strengthened security work in all olympic venues and in the olympic village we are well prepared in security for the upcoming games
1810316 we think the olympics will proceed and they will proceed smoothly and well we think the chinese have got it covered as far as humanly possible
1810317 theres been a lot issues about this raised about how this technology will be used after the games and even during the games
1810318 i doubt that group has the wherewithal to make it to central beijing and to intervene in the olympics but it is a threat and there are many other threats
1810319 beijing as the host city will of course make full preparations for biological attacks like anthrax we have even made antibiotics and vaccines
1810320 but they shouldnt have destroyed my house evicted me and left me homeless
1810321 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling
1810322 because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
1810323 if democrats want to block what a majority of the house and senate want they can proceed with a strategy that would in effect shut down the government
1810324 but it is not surprising newt gingrich would raise that threat since he and the republican party shut down the government in the 1990s
1810325 we shut the federal government down for a brief period in order to get a balanced budget
1810326 republicans are doing nothing but pushing the failed johnny one note policies of the past
1810327 and i think weve got a lot of energy left in us dont we
1810328 i think the energy level has shifted between the two parties in the last couple weeks
1810329 and my hunch is there are a lot of democrats back home who are tap dancing
1810330 the campus is taking this extremely seriously and is working closely with law enforcement agencies and our own campus resources to identify and apprehend the perpetrators as well as taking major proactive steps to support researchers in the face of violence and intimidation
1810331 our position is that threats and violence to make a political point are not acceptable and strongly condemned
1810332 shed light on the role of france in the genocide of tutsis in 1994
1810333 there are in this report unacceptable accusations leveled against french politicians and the french military
1810334 we are witnessing for several years now an insidious attempt to re write history
1810335 this efforts goal is to transform france into a party engaged in complicity in the genocide this is an unacceptable falsification
1810336 during the time i was in charge of french diplomacy april 1993 to may 1995 we made every effort possible to help in the reconciliation of rwandans
1810337 french soldiers themselves directly were involved in assassinations of tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis
1810338 at this point he provided essentially no biographical data about himself before 1993
1810339 we want to find out if he is indeed christopher chichester
1810340 and if so if theres anything he can tell us about the disappearance and possible homicide of the sohuses
1810341 our experience tells us hes more of a schemer than someone who has lost his memory
1810342 he loves his daughter kidnapping doesnt apply it was his own kid
1810343 just because hes reighs natural father it doesnt absolve him

1810379 sometime you have to cram your face between the bed and the wall
1810380 whats more obscene the official position that waterboarding is not torture or our official position that its a thrill ride
1810381 it is unfortunate in a district like the 2nd congressional district where past representatives have been such stalwarts for the environment that a candidate would be a supporter of cyanide heap leach mining
1810382 i have not and will not support this type of mining it poisons our environment
1810383 oh no thats all wrong none of gods grace is wasted

1810405 although we werent able to shatter that highest hardest glass ceiling this time thanks to you its got about 18 million cracks in it
1810406 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1810407 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1810408 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions
1810409 and his view that nothing should be done unilaterally by either side to alter the status quo on beijing he faces a delicate balancing act

1810437 how can i insist that he be charged if there is no evidence the police are not stupid to charge him
1810438 the governments problem is a huge problem and this sodomy charge is not going to deflect other kind of problems we are having at the moment
1810439 i am not one to ask people to charge other people i did say that if you have something to charge and you have evidence then charge if you dont have evidence then drop the charge drop the whole thing and the investigation more
1810440 the malaysian governments record provides little basis to believe this is anything other than a partisan political attack on anwar
1810441 in light of past false allegations and his unfair trial anwar has good reason to worry that his rights wont be respected
1810442 the police operation to arrest anwar was designed to intimidate and punish
1810443 this inquiry has already raised serious concerns about police bias transparency and the governments willingness to flout the law for political ends
1810444 if he is not guilty why worry about giving a new dna sample if he is indeed innocent there is nothing for him to fear if he has not done anything than provide a sample do it i want to see it lets see the result which could prove that he did not do it
1810445 comments by government ministers about anwars case are improper pressure on the police and prosecutor
1810446 malaysia claims to be a well ordered democracy wedded to the rule of law but the anwar investigation says just the opposite
1810447 the federal courts decision to release anwar ibrahim marks an historic milestone in the restoration of confidence in the rule of law and respect for human rights in malaysia
1810448 it exposed a pattern of political manipulation of key state institutions including the police public prosecutors office and the judiciary all of which are crucial in safeguarding the human rights of malaysians
1810449 well if you guys go in a car then the 4 of you only pay for gas once but if you buy plane tickets then thats 4 seperate plane tickets round trip so its cheaper plus mississippi is right around the corner
1810450 kpu provinsi terus menerus melakukan monitoring ke seluruh daerah berdasarkan hasil evaluasi dan monitoring terakhir diketahui seluruh distribusi logistik telah dilakukan ke seluruh kpps seluruh kpud menyatakan siap melaksanakan pencoblosan pada tanggal 5 april nanti
1810451 nanti seluruh pemilih akan menerima surat undangan pencoblosan undangan itu sekaligus untuk memberitahu di mana para pemilih melakukan pencoblosan jadi pemilih yang tertukar alamatnya tak perlu bingung karena nantinya akan diberi tahu di mana melakukan pencoblosan
1810452 jadi seluruhnya ada sekitar 60 ribu petugas kpps sebelum pencoblosan mereka akan disumpah
1810453 berdasarkan petunjuk kpu pusat untuk kecamatan yang penduduknya kurang dari 10 ribu jiwa tak perlu dipasang jaringan komputer
1810454 makanya pg bertekad menggerakkan mesin partai untuk meraih kemenangan pilkada tersebut
1810455 ini juga untuk meraih pristise partai golkar makanya kita harus rapatkan barisan untuk kebesaran partai dan memenangkan pasangan iskandar hafiz
1810456 dan kemenangan partai golkar bisa diraih dalam pemilu 2004 lalu dengan persentase suara yang cukup signifikan
1810457 apalagi di sini tanah laut tidak dilaksanakan pemilihan bupati dan wakil bupati suara pg harus solid untuk memenangkan pilkada provinsi
1810458 berarti demokrasi itu adalah pemerintahan rakyat atau government of the people by the people and for the people pemerintahan dari rakyat oleh rakyat dan untuk rakyat
1810459 dengan bermartabat menyebabkan manusia berhak memiliki keyakinan dan pendirian yang tak bisa diubah secara paksa oleh siapa pun
1810460 jadi pemimpin pemerintah demokratis itu harus berasal dari masyarakat luas bukan dari kelompok tertentu
1810461 seperti semboyan revolusi prancis untuk membebaskan rakyat dari sistem otoriter yakni liberte egalite dan fraternate
1810462 di sini al farabi menyatakan bahwa negara itu memiliki penduduk dengan berbagai profesi mereka semuanya bergerak
1810463 mereka ingin selalu diistimewakan bahkan status seseorang itu ditentukan oleh kelebihan yang dimilikinya dan negara pun diatur berdasar tingkatan kelebihan mereka
1810464 oleh karena itu mereka tak segan menumpahkan darah memperbudak dan berlaku kasa dan kejam bahkan yang jadi pemimpin adalah orang yang paling bisa menguasai orang lain paling kuat atau paling licik
1810465 meski bentuk negara terakhir ini masuk kategori bodoh namun menurut al farabi justru negara ini paling terpuji di atara negara yang bodoh lainnya
1810466 ini berarti sistem kenegaraan islam pada dasarnya teokrasi namun berbeda dengan di barat karena porsi peran rakyat yang besar mungkin sistem yang tepat adalah teodemokrasi yakni kedaulatan rakyat yang terbatas oleh kedaulatan allah
1810467 meski pun bulan nantinya berganti seharusnya kejujuran yang diajarkan oleh ramadan ini tetap dilakukan oleh umat muslim
1810468 akan lebih baik tidak ahli namun jujur dibandingkan ahli tapi tidak jujur jika tidak ahli maka tinggal terus dilatih sehingga lambat laun akan ahli juga namun jika tidak jujur maka keahlian tersebut bisa jadi akan digunakan untuk berbuat curang di perusahaan soal kejujuran tidak gampang pula diubah
1810469 seleksi ternyata sangat gampang seluruh pelamar diberikan satu bibit pohon yang diminta dirawat selama satu bulan setelah itu dibawa kembali ke istana
1810470 sebelum bersantap sahur sebaiknya kita salat sunat dulu apalagi ini malam 21 ramadan mudahan malam lailatul qadar paling paling 15 menit
1810471 kita salat tobat salat tahajud dan salat hajat masing masing dua rakaat
1810472 pada salat hajat nanti di sujud terakhir ucapkan saja hajat
1810473 ayo langsung dimakan tak usah malu malu untung masih ada waktu
1810474 jadi setelah makan selesai beberapa saat saja menunggu waktu imsyak
1810475 dari laporan yang disampaikan oleh seluruh kpud disimpulkan bahwa pemilu dinyatakan berjalan dengan sukses dan lancar bahwa ada kelemahan dan kesalahan kami tak menampik tapi semua itu tak terlepas dari faktor sdm
1810476 inilah yang membuat penghitungan suara mengalami keterlambatan dari jadwal yang ditetapkan ini memang disebabkan sosialisasi yang kurang masalahnya adalah waktu yang sangat mepet sedangkan kpu terfokus pada masalah logistik ya begitulah mau gimana lagi semua itu karena masalah sdm dan ketidaksiapan petugas jadi bukan karena faktor kesengajaan
1810477 ada yang dikatakan pakai tinta palsu itu karena memang logistiknya habis demikian pula formulir yang dimasukkan dalam kantong plastik karena memang amplopnya yang habis tapi itukan ada petunjuknya sedangkan ada formulir yang difotokopi itu juga disebabkan pembagian yang tak merata sehingga yang mengalami kekurangan terpaksa difotokopi
1810478 untuk melakukan pemilihan ulang di daerah yang bermasalah itu tak gampang masalah dana dan logistik serta petugas dan pemilih adalah faktor yang harus diperhatikan selain itu batas waktu yang telah diberikan juga sudah lewat tak gampang melakukan pemilihan ulang

1810509 its difficult to praise rob without insinuating that there was something not great about his predecessor and ive got nothing but respect and love for jason but rob hes been with us five years now and its completely effortless its never felt this complete
1810510 sometimes i look over at him and hes playing his bass onstage and it feels like hes always been there his chemistry his personality it just all fits in really really well hes a godsend

1810513 more people will be using computer read paper ballots than at any other time in the nations history
1810514 as you get more registered voters and more people in the pool it exacerbates this bigger issues of paper
1810515 after 2000 there was a widespread revulsion about paper everyone had the mental image of the guy cross eyed looking at the punch card ballot
1810516 but theres no silver bullet youre trading one set of problems for another
1810517 a lot of officials are in damage control mode because theyre going to try to limit the problems of switching to paper
1810518 you will have ballots not showing up being printed wrong the litany of mistakes voters make with these ballots and then theres incredible pressure in a crowded polling place for people who are trying to make their decision

1810535 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link

1810566 i have come to the conclusion that one useless man is a disgrace two are a law firm and three or more are called a congress
1810567 just 12 of voters think congress has passed any legislation to improve life in this country over the past six months
1810568 the president has made this a key part of his legacy
1810569 education has two purposes on the one hand to form the mind on the other hand to train the citizen
1810570 as for the manual workers they will be discouraged from serious thought they will be made as comfortable as possible and their hours of work will be much shorter than they are at present they will have no fear of destitution or of misfortune to their children as soon as working hours are over amusements will be provided or a sort calculated to cause wholesome mirth and to prevent any thoughts of discontent which otherwise might cloud their happiness on those rare occasions when a boy or girl who has passed the age at which it is usual to determine social status shows such marked ability as to seem the intellectual equal of the rulers a difficult situation will arise requiring serious consideration if the youth is content to abandon his previous associates and to throw in his lot whole heartedly with the rulers he may after suitable tests be promoted but if he shows any regrettable solidarity with his previous associates the rulers will reluctantly conclude that there is nothing to be done with him except to send him to the lethal chamber before his ill disciplined intelligence has had time to spread revolt this will be a painful duty to the rulers but i think they will not shrink from performing it
1810571 those children on the other hand who are destined to become members of the governing class will have a very different education they will be selected some before birth some during the first three years of life and a few between the ages of three and six all the best known science will be applied to the simultaneous development of eugenics chemical and thermal treatment of the embryo and diet in early years will be used with a view to the production of the highest possible ultimate ability the scientific outlook will be instilled from the moment that a child can talk and throughout the early impressionable years the child will be carefully guarded from contact with the ignorant and unscientific from infancy up to twenty one scientific knowledge will be poured into him and at any rate from the age of twelve upwards he will specialize in those sciences for which he shows the most aptitude at the same time he will be taught physical toughness he will be encouraged to roll naked in the snow to fast occasionally for twenty four to run many miles on hot days to be bold in all physical adventures and uncomplaining when he suffers physical pain from the age of twelve upwards he will be taught to organize children slightly younger than himself and will suffer severe censure if groups of such children fail to follow his lead a sense of his high destiny will be constantly set before him and loyalty towards his order will be so axiomatic that it will never occur to him to question it every youth will thus be subjected to a threefold training in intelligence in self command and in command over others if he should fail in any one of these three he will suffer the terrible penalty of degradation to the ranks of common workers and will be condemned for the rest of his life to associate with men and women vastly inferior to himself in education and probably in intelligence the spur of this fear will suffice to produce industry in all but a very small minority of boys and girls of the governing class except for the one matter of loyalty to the world state and to their own order members of the governing class will be encouraged to be adventurous and full of initiative it will be recognized that it is their business to improve scientific technique and to keep the manual workers contented by means of continual new amusements as those upon whom all progress depends they must not be unduly tame nor so drilled as to be incapable of new ideas unlike the children destined to be manual workers they will have personal contact with their teacher and will be encouraged to argue with him it will be his business to prove himself in the right if he can and if not to acknowledge his error gracefully there will however be limits to intellectual freedom even among the children of the governing class they will not be allowed to question the value of science or the division of the population into manual workers and experts they will not be allowed to coquette with the idea that perhaps poetry is as valuable as machinery or love as good a thing as scientific research if such ideas do occur to any venturesome spirit they will be received in a pained silence and there will be a pretence that they have not been heard a profound sense of public duty will be instilled into boys and girls of the governing class as soon as they are able to understand such an idea they will be taught to feel that mankind depends upon them and that they owe benevolent service especially to the less fortunate classes beneath them but let it not be supposed that they will be prigs far from it they will turn off with a deprecating laugh any too portentous remark that puts into explicit words what they will all believe in their hearts their manners will be easy and pleasant and their sense of humour unfailing
1810572 education used to begin at eight years old with the learning of the latin declensions now under the influence of psycho analysis it begins at birth it is to be expected that with the advance of experimental embryology the important part of education will be found to be pre natal this is already the case with fishes and newts but in regard to them the scientist is not hampered by education authorities
1810573 in normal cases children of sufficiently excellent heredity will be admitted to the governing class from the moment of conception

1810576 aww i aint as talented as some of the guys who play here im not actually a musician im just a composer
1810577 mumbai born composer ashutosh phataks music is the stuff of dreams opulent lucid and at times unsettling ashus mystic soundscapes artfully weave stories of love and loss of hope and fear stories that are at once intensely personal and invitingly universal his psy fi rock operas are best listened to in their entirety and offer an immersive sensory experience that immediately engulfs both his debut album i and upcoming sophomore release epiphany are rooted in duality and exist in fantastic worlds that are intimate expansive and rich in their visual imagery but listener beware this is not music for the faint of heart journeying as it does between the ethereal and the nightmarish
1810578 ive often wondered what it would be like to just say a few words and have the whole world understand you
1810579 some geriatric idiot pushed in front of me in the coffee shop and made me miss the train
1810580 i cant get into my email again it wont open it just wont open no i dont know
1810581 look im sorry i missed my train i didnt mean to
1810582 with this much work to do you will make an effort to be in on time
1810583 this isnt the first time youve been late this month is it
1810584 your appraisal is due tomorrow and ill be the one writing it
1810585 you do know its not me its the pressure rita puts on me
1810586 im sorry i didnt mean to disturb are you in tonight
1810587 i said to her liz hes not going to like it and she said well i dont care and i said well you better there are girls here that dont like it when youre flirt with their boyfriends and she said
1810588 have you seen her after just one glass of wine shes all over them like a rash with her tight tops and her skirts that look like belts
1810589 my jasons as bad as youre john four pints of larger and he thinks hes gods gift i tell you when hes drunk if his thing was half as enthusiastic as he is id have no complaints
1810590 truly one of the brightest stars in the galaxy today and we dont see her give interviews very often so ladies and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure to welcome the enigmatic the vibrant the dearly loved tia green
1810591 were letting you go i would like volunteers to come in early tomorrow we have a lot of work to catch up on and the sooner we get started the better overtime will be paid
1810592 ive often wondered what it would be like to just say a word or two and have the whole world understand you
1810593 i cant get into my email again it wont open it just erm actually now its working
1810594 i even heard hed been with that slag model lia bright the one in the shampoo ads
1810595 if i had her figure and looks and george christian between my sheets i tell you i certainly wouldnt kick him out bed if id heard hed been with a few tarts
1810596 yes but darling if he did in fact divert the funding to health
1810597 i feel sure the public would be deeply grateful our health system that which belongs to you and i is far more important to the nation than a new motorway
1810598 but the chancellors proposing to cut funding from not just one perhaps isolated project but from three major expansions of the network surely if one doesnt recognise the need for greater road capacity now this will impact on an already fragile economy in few short years
1810599 you know ladies it may not be considered an election winner
1810600 but i sense a shift in the public mood i feel that higher fuel and health duties to pay for these and many more highly valued projects to come would win support the states infrastructure at all levels needs to be maintained with the utmost care
1810601 theyre always conveniently delayed tia its an old tale with this much work to do you will make an effort to catch an earlier train
1810602 this isnt the first time youve been late this month is it
1810603 your appraisal is due tomorrow ill be the one writing it
1810604 you know its not me its the pressure rita puts on me
1810605 no we havent but i just received a call from the police for they have
1810606 he just took his clothes off in front of you
1810607 i well i read somewhere that sometimes people who have taken say drugs can have sudden flashbacks and do strange things
1810608 ill have to mention it to the police when they get here
1810609 i mean if its obvious to us then it must be to them too
1810610 still its certainly worth a mention tia the police may need to talk to you but after that would you like to go home
1810611 the gentleman who brought you back from the shop has just left he was concerned for you as we all are
1810612 if its okay with you id now like to go home
1810613 wed better get up or well be late for work
1810614 i was merely assisting in the movement of a filthy cheat from the position she had stolen
1810615 she is our guiding light who wills us all to fight
1810616 ladies and gentlemen she is the brightest star in the galaxy today and as we are all aware she rarely grants interviews that is why tonight instead of my usual three guests i am dedicating my entire show to only her
1810617 my dear ladies and gentlemen without further ado it gives me great pleasure to welcome the enigmatic the vibrant the dearly loved tia green
1810618 what the heck honey we need gas but the price is too high i guess ill get it on the island
1810619 revolution but it sounds to me like their not giving up on the business just yet
1810620 this is the song from the animated movie the snowman and its the song that i would take with me to a desert island i think its the most beautiful piece of music ever written and it brings back a lot of memories for me because in finland every christmas eve they show the snowman on tv which makes it a really big part of christmas we decided to cover it in homage to the greatest song ever written
1810621 when i heard this song on finnish radio was when i discovered females in metal music that album is still one of my favourites to this day it brought in this whole new idea of females singing with metal bands f and definitely without it nightwish would not exist
1810622 this was the first music video i saw about 20 years ago and i just immediately fell in love with the song and especially the video i think its filmed in ireland its gary moore playing among all of this really beautiful irish scenery which just looks incredible
1810623 from the soundtrack to the movie gladiator this is probably the best piece of film music ever written and it really started me off as a film music maniac its about 10 minutes long and it really captures everything thats great about that movie soundtrack you can really visualise bits of the movie in the music which is something i really got into from seeing that film
1810624 if i had to name one song ive listened to the most times in my life it would be this song literally thousands of times and it really hasnt lost any of its appeal at all its seven minutes of the same thing over and over again but that atmosphere in it is huge ive fallen asleep so many times to this song it is so heavenly
1810625 my dying bride have had a massive impact on me particularly in my lyric writing i think aaron stanthorpe is one of the best lyricists in the whole world when i was at high school there was this girl and she didnt know anything about me until one day i went to her and gave her the lyrics to this song and said this is how i feel about you after that we were together for a couple of years
1810626 this song itself is incredible but what makes the song great for me is the video because its probably the best one ever made i love all the imagery and atmosphere in the video its quite dark and looks like something we might do with all the landscapes and the girl dancing and stuff
1810627 girls its just the guys dirty minds isnt it huge response its warm in here maybe you should buy some rubbers because when you get close in all that heat you might get wet
1810628 there have been a couple of really special ones but i think she should be finnish because of the language and culture
1810629 theres only been one middle finger in 15 shows and by the end wed won her over too im not homesick im in no hurry to get home to the cold and snow everything is new and exciting ask me again in three years
1810630 ive played these types of places with cover bands where people grab your ass or yell show us your tits it doesnt bother me my old band alyson avenue sold 10 000 copies without lifting a finger no shows that doesnt work in america so you need to get out and play these places
1810631 its time to choose whether the story of nightwish ends here or whether it will still continue an undetermined period of time
1810632 it was the most difficult thing i ever had to do
1810633 it was a combination of many different factors the way tarja felt about the band her motives her values the fact that the next album was definitely going to be her last with nightwish and that she didnt want to tour with us anymore not even after the next record why should we continue working a person with an attitude like that
1810634 it is a mixture of pain hope and relief all this has been a really big burden for the entire band and so it feels like relief like a new start but of course it is sad as well that the whole thing had to end like this it is hard for tarja for the band and for the fans for everybody but i also believe that time will heal all wounds perhaps the sun will shine again in a few weeks
1810635 yes ive always said that personal relations are the most difficult thing in life and here we have a really good example of that
1810636 it was really strange that was the hardest day of my life but during the gig i was able to forget everything that was about to come i think it was the best concert that we ever played everything was just great the arena all the visual effects and a lot more above all the fans were fantastic during our show a lot of dreams came true and it was the first time that i cried onstage during a gig for a number of different reasons
1810637 yes i wrote the letter about three weeks before the concert and when we decided on the title we thought that it would fit the dvd
1810638 the main reason was that we wanted to give her the letter personally so she didnt have to read its contents on the internet she wanted to fly to argentina where her husband marcelo is from the day after the show but after our performance we didnt want to take this last evening and her happiness away from her and in addition she was throwing a party following the concert so we gave her the letter hugged her and said its better that you read this tomorrow there were many different reasons for doing it this way and i dont want to explain in detail why we had to handle it like this there was no possibility for us to talk about it with her it was the only way all i can tell you is believe me
1810639 my conscience is clear and i have no doubts about whether we acted correctly or the way we did it
1810640 yes exactly that was a really important point in our decision to make it not only a personal letter but an open one for everybody to see if we had announced that tarja was no longer a member of the band and that we would go on with another singer we would have to do interviews about this for the next few years we wanted the truth to be told because we were a little bit concerned things went sour between us and we were worried that tarja would come out with something first before we had a chance to explain ourselves we wanted to be the first ones to tell the real story of what happened thats why everything happened so suddenly and then there was the fact that tarja wanted to leave finland the day after the show we wouldnt have had the opportunity to do this for a month if we hadnt done it when we did there was no other possibility anyway we hadnt really been talking to each other for a year we tried a few times but it was a nightmare i think she has to open her eyes first there is absolutely nothing that we could have changed by talking first of all she has to understand the facts and make them clear to herself
1810641 the thing is that we never saw tarja because she did everything on her own at gigs we always met her fifteen minutes before the start of the show she never came to interviews and she never turned up at soundchecks we saw her when she was completely dressed up and prepared for the show shortly before the gig started and afterwards she went directly to the car and drove to the hotel and that was it the next time we saw her was right before the next gig she didnt want to travel with us she didnt want to go by bus with us nor by car she didnt want to join us for meals she didnt want to do any interviews nothing actually there were two different camps during the last few months tarja told the finnish media about her solo career and she always emphasized that nightwish was not the thing that she wants to do in her life that it was not her voice and not her music she was only a guest musician she really hurt me with these words because it sounded like the whole thing felt just embarrassing to her
1810642 its like john lennon and yoko ono it was very difficult to get close to tarja because there was a huge argentinean wall between us when you sent her an email or an sms text message it was answered in english by marcelo all the financial issues and arguments started to be really ridiculous it is not so much that she didnt want to do gigs in america or australia because in her opinion the venues and fees were too small its more about her attitude as a whole it all started with two sentences from her one of them i already mentioned i dont need nightwish for my career anymore you know i can leave this band anytime that sent the coldest shiver down my back she is an old friend of mine and for her to think that way so these are her motives to be in the band it was unbelievable
1810643 yes i lost a friend i lost a lot and when you read the letter and read between the lines as well then i hope youll understand that im not angry with her that i dont hate her
1810644 during the last year i was very frustrated and i still am im sad and disappointed but it is not tarja that i see it is someone else
1810645 i was surprised that she sounded that shocked i dont know how blind and deaf she must have been over the last year things went incredibly bad between her and the rest of the band and i thought she would have at least expected something like this to happen
1810646 we were never bothered by the fact that you didnt participate in writing arranging songs you never in 9 years came to rehearse the songs with us before going to the studio not the fact that while on tour you always wanted to fly separately from us with your husband
1810647 i cannot do anything to change that many fans will feel that way and i dont criticize them for it in some way it is understandable tarja gave nightwish its image but i still hope that many people will understand how much the whole band makes nightwish what it is i dont claim that tarjas position was wrong because it worked really well like that i try to see it as the end of an era and the beginning of a new one
1810648 the harder songs have to be in the right place to give the singer time to recover you dont want to burn out the vocalist which we almost did the set needs to build air conditioning changes in the atmosphere and having to be able to sleep on the bus all affect the voice
1810649 im uneasy about turning my life over to someone i dont know driver what if he falls asleep
1810650 they had a relationship for the last three years where they were all one big happy family
1810651 to report an acquaintance of hers was being reluctant to let her see her own children
1810652 basically she took in the family including the mom and then when it came time for her to give the kids back to their mom she refused and she left the area
1810653 nobody knows where she is right now thats why were doing the amber alert thats the last resort
1810654 she has a lot of excuses and we looked into each of her excuses and her reasons and determined that we needed to file charges

1810658 in every single city where the test was conducted at minimum almost half of the phones were returned and despite the temptation that people must have felt to keep the phones and the fact that the test imposed on everyones time the average return rate was remarkable 68 percent or about two thirds of the 30 phones we dropped in each city

1810663 on one day you get a headline poles flood into england implying the country is drowning in immigrants and the next day you get poles desert england as if we are abandoning them
1810664 poles are not totally innocent no society is totally innocent and if a pole does something wrong then he or she should have to face the music
1810665 but when you get a series of articles and none of the headlines shed a positive light and all shed a negative light by using this sort of terminology then it is fair to say we can complain about bias
1810666 i was looking at the sturgis schedule and noticed that you had a beauty pageant so i encouraged cindy to compete

1810674 if all 17 000 permatang pauh umno members remain loyal to us and if we can attract about 10 000 non malay voters we can definitely defeat anwar
1810675 later in the 2004 general election the voters sympathised with wan azizah because of anwars imprisonment
1810676 in the recent march general election they once again sympathised because anwar was disqualified from active politics until april as a result to his earlier corruption conviction
1810677 reports that the examination done a few hours before saiful lodged a police report against anwar showed no evidence that saiful had been sodomised by anyone has raised serious questions

1810719 i think that my kids have so many opportunities in the united states and its important for them to realize its good to know who you are and where youre from
1810720 i know a lot of people arent giving us much of a chance to get out of the group stage and we know that
1810721 but people have said that about american teams in the past and weve been able to prove people wrong
1810722 we are just going in with the mentality that were a good side who is going to be working hard and giving it our all when we hit the field were focusing on what we need to do to get results
1810723 i think we have the talent we have the group of players who can get this done i believe in this team and i think we can surprise a lot of people in this tournament

1810743 the leader of the royal jeradine union the head of the jeradine state the prime minister of the jeradine alignment princess anais aria
1810744 it would appear we are standing on the threshold of conflict
1810745 a whirlwind of diplomatic activity continues for i shall always pursue peace
1810746 weapons of wonder have been visiting our shores once again power such as we have never seen before striking us from our outer borders to the heart of our capital even those misguided ones who choose to disagree with me are now being mercilessly felled my love and my compassion pour out endlessly to the fallen and their families
1810747 and i ask myself why what have we done to so offend yarcatzn our past differences are just that past conflicts of history are history we have not impinged on each others sovereignty in decades in point of fact we have deliberately stepped back so as to care for our own people and own lands and despite the difficulties we faced with open and determined hearts we have flowered into a respectful kindly peaceful alignment of nations
1810748 i am then compelled to ask is greed the reason you strike at us have you become envious of our prosperity perhaps or have you been cultivating a deep seated hatred toward us in the years following conflict
1810749 what is it about our jeradine and our loyal friends that causes you to expel my diplomats to expel those in the employee of your nation that were born in mine to expel our families who have lived with you and supported you in peace for years
1810750 it leaves a foul taste in my mouth but i have to and i shall continue to respond to you in kind for every man woman and child of jeradine descent you throw out i shall throw out two
1810751 and as for weapons of wonder and your filthy assaults on my people i declare to you that we are not as toothless as your leaders would have you believe i can and i will deploy weapons into theatre the likes of which you have never dreamed possible we have no desire to inflict suffering but i tell you this
1810752 continue these assaults and i shall unleash a storm of vengeance upon you the likes of which this planet has never seen
1810753 we have right on our side we will fight purely in defence of our own people and we are sure to win
1810754 it was nothing it was just a daft unbecoming thought
1810755 this has gone that is lost throw in an overused another avoidable tragedy and the standard is complete no
1810756 i have to say youre nothing if not prosaic brooke
1810757 i am however annoyed as hell by not only your lack of restraint but your brazenness what was going through your mind when you decided to send one of your lackeys to me in public in calcourt square no less
1810758 you are the one who needs to re establish focus considerable care goes into when where and how we drop kavas tell me who will it serve if this channel is shut down did you think through what would happen if loose stunts like that are discovered

1810762 ill be interested to hear what you make of the event itself
1810763 all right so the reason for my apparent lack of restraint and brazenness is that we have a lead were unable to follow up ourselves as she resides in tiaserene
1810764 your intel has spotted something mine has not on my doorstep
1810765 she lodges in severns yard and allegedly has knowledge perhaps even a capacity that it is highly suggestive ordinarily i would dismiss such chatter it as farfetched but im many suns away from rejecting any possible insight these days my report is on the clip though i understand you have to see her to see it
1810766 tian you are aware how we feel about this arent you

1810771 convivi com o jo o saldanha na inf ncia ele me falou coisas lindas sobre o botafogo quando foi na minha casa mas comecei a torcer mesmo pelo botafogo nos anos 80 e foi aquele per odo da travessia do deserto eu tinha que torcer por wecsley perivaldo cremilson jerson com j
1810772 com o botafogo as favas nunca est o contadas n s nunca temos certeza
1810773 eu gosto do cuca um dos melhores t cnicos do brasil mas eu estava em buenos aires e vi a rea o dele durante o jogo contra o river foi se encolhendo nesse ponto o cuca o anti felip o ele precisa viver um 89 como n s vivemos falta ao cuca um passe do mazolinha para o maur cio quando ele viver esse momento de alegria o momento da grande vit ria ser ainda melhor treinador
1810774 quando o botafogo ganha a alegria vem com uma intensidade muito maior do que a dos outros times foi assim em 1989 quando o rio viveu uma explos o de alegria que s se compara em intensidade tristeza com a perda da copa de 1982
1810775 f cil torcer pelo flamengo pertencer maioria ser botafogo n o desde a escola uma afirma o de identidade significa ter opini o pr pria n o seguir a moda por isso acho que o torcedor do botafogo um torcedor de fibra moral ser botafoguense te ensina muitas coisas a respeito da vida
1810776 eu n o quero que o flamengo morra n o mas eu quero que o flamengo perca
1810777 fiquei feliz quando o fluminense perdeu a libertadores se eles ganhassem seria como o rapaz que sempre cortejou uma mo a mas nunca teve chance de casar com ela porque ela nunca te deu muita bola a de repente o seu vizinho consegue namorar e noivar com ela est prestes a casar l gico que nesse caso voc prefere que ela case com um estrangeiro que vem do equador para lev la do que com o cara que est do seu lado e vai fic la exibindo o tempo inteiro

1810779 i would say that the team with the experience at quarterback probably has the lead going in because the experience at that position is so important
1810780 when youre breaking in a new quarterback theres always a growing process
1810781 mark will be a lot better this year he knows its his time the year of maturity where hes had a little experience means a lot
1810782 you can have a guy thats very talented and there are a lot of them in our league and a lot of new ones in our league that are going to be playing but theres nothing like having that experience on the football field
1810783 with rudy coming back i feel very good about that aspect of it not only has he played a lot hes been very successful
1810784 youve got to have support people because the quarterback cant do it on their own
1810785 its a dogfight and you have to protect your players and be healthy
1810786 the first time i came in here i felt like i was being recruited all over again
1810787 the no 1 thing its going to be a good recruiting tool
1810788 thats the no 1 thing we were able to do some good things at the old place but for long term it helps recruiting
1810789 i think it shows how much our program has evolved from where it used to be
1810790 we have flat screen tvs everywhere our locker room is huge our players lounge is great im so glad my senior year i get to have facilities like this
1810791 we almost have too many things and that cant be a bad thing its got everything we need and then some hopefully it boosts everything about jayhawk football as far as recruiting and everything
1810792 you need to have a place in college football that you have access to everything you need when you need it
1810793 when you need to be in the weight room youre there when you need to use the auditorium for meetings its there when youre having two a day practices and you have a lot of kids who need taped or treatment the tables are ready theyre not sharing them with others who are waiting
1810794 the thing the kids will really enjoy more than anything else is coming over here and actually relaxing in their complex and being able to concentrate on game day
1810795 a lot of times coming to the stadium on the bus on game day there are people stopping traffic to try to sell tickets our buses are sitting in the traffic waiting while somebody is trying to scalp some tickets
1810796 i filed the case against him because i was not informed that he would give the money i donated for the water pumps to gawad kalinga instead
1810797 clearly any resolution of this case is not only premature but will be done in grave violation of respondent rights to due process
1810798 they can fault me for my litigation skills but not my integrity
1810799 the initial position of the kbp was to support the calls for decriminalization however we received reactions from our own practitioners broadcast journalists pointing out that decriminalization would potentially increase violence against journalists because those who have been victimized by libel would have no recourse or would have limited recourse
1810800 while mr arroyo has withdrawn the charges the message sent is clear
1810801 in this modern day and age journalists spending time in prison for their work is anathema to a democracy
1810802 journalists report on public figures politicians and government institutions our work is central to a democracy where accurate and honest writing investigative reporting and critical opinion grounded on sound analysis help strengthen institutions rather than diminish them
1810803 we support a bill that would decriminalize libel insofar as public officials and matters of public interest are concerned but if the subjects of a libel are private persons when it is purely a private matter criminal libel should be retained
1810804 it will be a giant step towards strengthening of the democratic process in our land when freedom of expression is enshrined
1810805 we have to be honest my perception is that most of the legislators and government officials do not want to decriminalize libel because it is always the public officials who are the subject of news
1810806 being a government official for a number of years ive been always hearing comments from fellow public officials that the press can make or unmake a public officials
1810807 our congressmen know the situation and importance of press freedom
1810808 there are efforts of individual organizations to make staff members observe ethical standards some news organizations do investigate and have suspended their staff
1810809 at the same time public officials and those in government should get to know how media organizations work so that they become more tolerant of honest reporting and dissenting opinion
1810810 this is a trend we were hearing about even before talk of a recession really started
1810811 gen y students look to their parents for advice and support and this is just another example of a trend with this generation
1810812 if you can get a modern car built on the old structure i think you can i think we can
1810813 the olympics brings us to new markets on a worldwide scale and i cant imagine how big the game can become in countries like united states
1810814 i dont think that golf should be an olympic sport at all
1810815 i dont think basketball should be an olympic sport i dont think tennis should be an olympic sport
1810816 if i was running the olympics i would go back to the way it was originally gymnastics weight lifting swimming track and field marathons thats to me what the olympics is
1810817 to me the olympics was founded on amateur sports guys go in there training for four years and putting their whole lives on the line to win a gold medal
1810818 it is strange that someone has said there is systematic doping these situations are very unpleasant but to say it is systematic is premature
1810819 these results were known ages ago but they decided to release them just before the olympic games
1810820 there is a feeling that they officials did it especially to create unpleasantness for us
1810821 no one is excusing the athletes who broke the wada world anti doping agency code
1810822 there has to be some kind of weapon that will frighten those who dont have enough dignity to stop and for whom material profit is more powerful than moral gain

1810850 the lack of publication of respondent meralcos amended application for the increase of its generation charge is thus fatal by this omission the consumers were deprived of the right to file their comments thereon
1810851 the court disagrees with the investigating justice on this point to constitute gross ignorance of the law the acts complained of must not only be contrary to existing law and jurisprudence but were motivated by bad faith fraud dishonesty and corruption it was not shown that judge panday was thus motivated when he ordered the dismissal of criminal case no 94 5506 upon the filing by the public and private prosecutors of a motion to withdraw and or dismiss which was based on the affidavit of desistance executed by the alleged victim and her parents
1810852 the way people look dress and act reveals their attitudes and interests you can tell much about a societys ideas and values by observing the appearance and behavior of its people
1810853 doctors have long suspected that secondary infections may keep some patients from healing quickly after severe muscle strain this hypothesis has now been proved by preliminary results of a study of two groups of patients the first group of patients all being treated for muscle injuries by dr newland a doctor who specializes in sports medicine took antibiotics regularly throughout their treatment their recuperation time was on average 40 percent quicker than typically expected patients in the second group all being treated by dr alton a general physician were given sugar pills although the patients believed they were taking antibiotics their average recuperation time was not significantly reduced therefore all patients who are diagnosed with muscle strain would be well advised to take antibiotics as part of their treatment

1810900 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1810901 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1810902 hi im barack obama of course you know that maybe john mccains right and i am the biggest celebrity in the world but that doesnt mean i dont have a plan for a better america john mccain wants to stick to outdated technologies like coal nuclear power and offshore drilling which would continue to harm our environment and keep us stuck in the 20th century my plan emphasizes renewable resources existing effective technology like wind and solar power and will have us completely independent from foreign oil by the year 2018 hmmmm maybe they like me for a reason
1810903 outdated technologies like coal nuclear power and now offshore drilling
1810904 people who have fought the civil rights battle politically economically legally as we have since the 50s would often talk about look what would happen if we had an african american president or chairpersons of major congressional committees
1810905 it doesnt look like its going to be what we all thought it would be
1810906 when i saw him over a year ago on c span vigorously opposed to the impeachment of bush and cheney vigorously opposed he said it would be divisive that is a cop out word we have the most multiply impeachable presidency in american history
1810907 majority of the votes in all of the states across the country
1810908 you stupid fucking ass we are about to lose a presidency that was in the damn bag
1810909 obama spent more money in my state so therefore hes going to win the election

1810933 if someone was faced with the prospect of after they knock down the heritage listed buildings the land would be forfeited to the state and become a lovely park maybe thatd make them think
1810934 next time ill ensure that i seek the correct legal and technical advice that i should
1810935 sometimes the value of the land can be worth more than the fine and some people might make a simple commercial decision to do something illegal cop the fine and still go on with their project
1810936 so maybe what we need to do is maybe bring the fines more in alignment with what the value of the projects might be

1810961 there are probably more investors today who use positive price momentum as an important part of their buy or hold criteria
1810962 investors are ready to fire a manager if they underperform for two or three quarters in a row
1810963 the response of the investment managers is to reduce the possibility for short term underperformance and momentum criteria help do that

1810987 last week in buffalo my hometown i had the opportunity to appear live on monday night raw the biggest stage of them all i was right there in front of a crowd of my hometown fans
1810988 i went to canisius college in buffalo and for the first time i saw so many people i went to school with chanting my name outside the arena and they had the opportunity to buy a ticket to watch me wrestle and be a star
1810989 but then there were the same people who thought i wouldnt amount to anything
1810990 they were there chanting my name dying to buy wwe shirts from the company i work for and probably regretting all those nasty things they said
1810991 ozzfest was incredible the thing i realized when i was there was when i was standing up on the stage and as amazing as it was seeing ozzy and mike bordin the drummer from faith no more and all these amazing guitarists well as cool as that was my favorite part was looking out into the crowd

1810994 but i also like crazy game of poker because about four or five years ago when i was in college wed play that song all summer long every time i hear that song it brings back so many memories
1810995 its probably one of my favorite concerts there are always big names and they have a second stage with up and coming bands which is really cool

1811005 i havent been to a summer concert in years but one i will remember all my life because i almost died is the offspring

1811011 it was on jones beach so it was outside overlooking the beach you cant get a better atmosphere than that for a summer concert i love to go to jones beach as much as i can but that concert really really nailed it
1811012 summerfest is a yearly thing but i havent been there in about five years its been too long its the biggest festival of the year

1811174 we expect revenues in the second half of the year to be somewhat lower than the first half due to the timing of the delivery of several large integration projects in the travel and leisure marketplace that we completed in the first half of this year and due to the continuing weakness in the general economy we believe that there will be continued high demand for projects involving microsofts sharepoint software and demand for server virtualization and unified communications should begin to gain traction

1811182 thats what the vision is its not to do it just on twitchell island its to see if we can do it throughout the delta on subsided land
1811183 when oxygen is limited the bugs the microbes have to eat and breathe somehow
1811184 they will use sulfate iron or some other compound instead of producing carbon dioxide at the end of the pathway they end up producing methane
1811185 you probably wont be able to replicate it everywhere because we have a long growing season and we have very specific conditions that occur in the delta that dont occur worldwide

1811197 at this time we are doing very well from an institutional financial facilities and staffing perspective and naperville 203 is blessed with seven hard working and dedicated board of education members whom i am certain will work with each other and with parents staff and community to find a talented and capable leader who will continue to move this district forward

1811211 get back to what a school board should be doing
1811212 this is the time for them to get back to focusing on the classroom and children

1811217 more people will be using computer read paper ballots than at any other time in the nations history
1811218 as you get more registered voters and more people in the pool it exacerbates this bigger issues of paper
1811219 after 2000 there was a widespread revulsion about paper everyone had the mental image of the guy cross eyed looking at the punch card ballot
1811220 but theres no silver bullet youre trading one set of problems for another
1811221 a lot of officials are in damage control mode because theyre going to try to limit the problems of switching to paper
1811222 you will have ballots not showing up being printed wrong the litany of mistakes voters make with these ballots and then theres incredible pressure in a crowded polling place for people who are trying to make their decision
1811223 paper is traditionally the device that the public is really good at screwing up

1811246 we were impressed with the quality of the nsoro team and expect nsoros revenue to grow dramatically in the next few years as it supports wireless infrastructure upgrades we expect nsoro to be accretive in 2009
1811247 we are excited about joining the mastec team we have strong relations with our customers and by combining with mastec we will expand our ability to grow in this rapidly expanding market
1811248 the pope said i used to be more strict about this but the example of christ led me to become more welcoming in cases in which perhaps there is not a mature and solid faith but there is a glimmer a desire of communion with the church

1811262 allen uses a narrator christopher evan welch to explain who the women are and at first it seems as if the director is just filling in backstory and telling us things we might have noticed ourselves but this narrator does for allen what narrators once did for francois truffaut he allows him to skip merely functional exposition and jump from highlight to highlight
1811263 hes telling a story thats swimming in mad erotic currents
1811264 and yet hes clearly decided against boob exposure not even a casual random glimpse its obviously unnatural and un european presumably this was about avoiding an r rating but the oddly prudish vibe works against the story and the general mood so why even pick up the brush if youre afraid to paint a nipple
1811265 in every defalcation it would be said that the fraudulent acts were not in the course of or in connection with the legal practice

1811268 we condemn in the strongest possible terms the mauritanian militarys overthrow of the democratically elected government of mauritania
1811269 we call on the military to release the president and the prime minister and to restore the legitimate constitutional democratically elected government immediately
1811270 the members of the mauritanian parliament wish to underline that it was the army that liberated the mauritanian people from the yoke of the dictatorship of president taya and its them again today that are defending the democratic gains we made

1811277 its the same with swimming water keeps the body cool it wont prevent sunburn but swimming does help prevent dehydration
1811278 your thirst is an active indicator of when your body needs fluids
1811279 you also need to replace salt and sports drinks can be a very helpful replacement
1811280 some drinks can actually dehydrate you like carbonated beverages with caffeine for every carbonated beverage you drink you need to drink two waters or sports drinks alcohol is also not a wise choice

1811303 we respect the process and we want to wait for the decision
1811304 if this happens in quebec this will be a big shot in the arm for wal mart workers everywhere

1811310 with a lot of inner strength he has a good sharp punch and counter punch jitender carries a formidable single power punch lakra too is strong and determined with strong single and double punches
1811311 rinus michels changed the game with his dutch team in the late 70s before him the german style was dominant they used beckenbauer as the libero went for man marking and attacked through the wings michels changed all that there was no libero no man marking high tempo and fluid all round display took the centrestage
1811312 even a talent like cristiano ronaldo is starting only in 50 per cent of the premier league matches rotation is now the buzzword in world football so for me they have had changed the game the real greats of the game maradona pele cruyff zidane showed exceptional skill on the field and influenced the crowd and the media they have been icons of the sport but did they change the game i dont think so
1811313 in the 90s when i went to malmo ff for the second time we had a champions cup match against sevilla maradona by then had moved from napoli to that spanish club i had a notion about maradona that he was a selfish player happy to show off his individual skills however that day i saw how good a team player he could be he went for every ball and created space for others it was an excellent all round display
1811314 once i had a talk with the juventus coach giovanni trapattoni who told me it was the best way to stop maradona he said that during maradonas stint at napoli every team tried to man mark him with their best defenders still maradona scored 30 goals for two consecutive seasons giving napoli the serie a title and the european champions cup collective defending is a safer bet
1811315 mr dasmunsi alone cant do anything clubs and the state associations must support him they must act in the right earnest there are lots of young players in mohun bagan east bengal and other clubs i want to see them playing in less important tournaments also the national momentum needs to get going a full house for a match makes a difference you can achieve more than you think
1811316 we are pleased that cas has confirmed our legal interpretation
1811317 it is laid down quite clearly in the fifa statutes
1811318 bremen manager klaus allofs said the clubs preparation for the beginning of the german season
1811319 we dont feel were the big winners because an impossible situation has arisen as a result of the delay
1811320 five minutes before the olympic football tournament kicks off we now have to decide whether to recall the player or not
1811321 in that case we wouldnt have let rafinha go under any circumstances
1811322 argentina opens thursday against the ivory coast in shanghai and brazil plays belgium in shenyang
1811323 hes relaxed and asks the people at barcelona to understand his situation the club is relaxed and i was figuring to put messi in the starting 11
1811324 theoretically the clubs could ask their players to go back to europe because they would be entitled to do so
1811325 and if the players do not come back there could be a case of a breach of contract
1811326 reeb said the case was narrowly focused on the three under 23 players and did not address the question of the over 23 players who are playing in the olympic football tournament
1811327 this decision does not affect the eligibility status of the players who have been validly entered by their national olympic committee and who remain fully eligible to compete in olympic games of beijing 2008
1811328 i am innocent and 8230 i have been framed by senior sai bosses who did not want me to go to beijing i have cleared at least 30 dope tests before how come just hours before i was scheduled to leave for beijing news is flashed on tv that i have tested positive
1811329 they sai officials are all thieves and 8230 just because i got into the cleaning act and decided to do away with corrupt sai coaches they are now after monika sais executive director teams r k naidu and sai coach hansa sharma among others have all ganged up against monika and implicated her
1811330 shailaja her coach the andhra association secretary and sai officials naidu and project officer for lifting satish rana have all ganged up against me and 8230 i want sai to conduct a fresh test im sure ill come out clean i will not go for the b sample test as it will simply be re testing the tampered sample on july 28 when they came to collect my urine sample in bangalore i told them the sample collection bottle was not sealed still they asked me to give the sample
1811331 fly me to beijing and my dope test scheduled for tomorrow will come out negative
1811332 no lifter will ever take the salt when he or she knows it could be detected even after six months the substance monika is being accused of taking can remain in the body for two years
1811333 every athlete caught for dope plays the blame game and 8230 there is a procedure for appeal and i would suggest monika follows that
1811334 he is not involved with dope testing in any way
1811335 i havent said anything about breaking any record my goals have not been published
1811336 i like challenges when i make my goals they are all challenges
1811337 i stay in my room and watch movies all day but i walk to the dining hall and to the bus
1811338 its the olympic games be ready to swim and compete when you have the opportunity
1811339 revenues for the second quarter were below expectations as we were impacted by the combination of the devastating sichuan earthquake the loss of the seasonal recruitment peak following the elimination of the may weeklong holiday and reduced demand for recruitment services during the quarter we began to see sluggish hiring by our corporate customers amid higher labor costs challenging conditions for certain industries including exporters and slower economic growth in china we expect recruitment activity in the third quarter will further moderate as we believe regulations instituted by the government for the olympic games will restrict normal business practices for companies in beijing and indirectly affect businesses nationwide in addition we expect individuals will focus more on these once in a lifetime games in china and less on job searches during this period
1811340 despite this difficult market environment we continue to view 2008 as a year of investment and will remain aggressive in executing our strategic initiatives of new product development and brand building we manage our business for the long term and will not sacrifice future growth for short term results we strongly believe these investments will enable us to extend our market leadership position in china and position us for higher growth and profitability when economic conditions improve
1811341 i am happy to report that we followed a strong first quarter with an even stronger second quarter our second quarter results surpassed our internal expectations
1811342 our second quarter results have reinforced our ability to perform well in an unstable economy our record setting performance is a tribute to our recent turn around strategies and the way we have positioned the new company to succeed i remain proud of our employees for their efforts in making the second quarter a record setting quarter for us

1811371 i am innocent i have always stayed away from doping and that is why i was selected in the trials
1811372 everyone knows there are various international tests and no sensible athlete would dope i am ready to go to beijing where my dope test is scheduled for tomorrow if i fail there shoot me in public
1811373 it was a pre meditated move because they did not give me tickets and other stuff required for travelling to beijing when i asked for it and told me to collect it on the next day
1811374 in fact we have already been informed of one of those tests being negative i dont know which tests they are talking about of being positive
1811375 they can ask for a b sample test that is the athlete and the federations prerogative

1811387 our goal is to unstack the deck and undo the deals restoring fairness and fiscal sense to mortgages

1811419 i am pleased to see that turkcell improved its performance and financial results during the second quarter of 2008
1811420 hughes had an outstanding quarter setting new records for second quarter revenue adjusted ebitda and new orders
1811421 revenues increased by 13 over the second quarter of 2007 to 266 million the key contributors to revenue growth were our consumer business and the international vsat segment new consumer activations increased by a strong 21 and net consumer adds by an even stronger 32 in the second quarter of 2008 over the second quarter of 2007 churn in the second quarter was 2 3 the same as in the second quarter of 2007 arpu increased to 66 in the second quarter of 2008 from 62 in the second quarter of 2007 the overall effect of these was that consumer services revenue increased to 80 million in the second quarter of 2008 a strong 23 growth over the second quarter of 2007
1811422 revenue in the international vsat segment grew by a strong 43 over the second quarter of 2007 to 65 million driven primarily by our european service subsidiary and international equipment exports from the u s for the second quarter of 2008 adjusted ebitda was an impressive 38 million for a growth of 22 over the second quarter of 2007
1811423 we also set a second quarter record for new orders by booking new orders of 333 million in the second quarter of 2008 including significant orders from bp blockbuster social security administration and american general finance in our north america enterprise business our international enterprise business received significant orders from the african development bank micro tech pt abhimata unip telemar brazil the spanish lottery service provider stl telefonica and afsat our mobile satellite business was awarded a significant order for over 100 million by globalstar
1811424 reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to gaap financial measures
1811425 we are very pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter of 2008 our consumer business continues to show strong growth and the robust orders in previous quarters in the international business have started to yield strong revenue growth consumers are being added to spaceway 3 as planned and we expect to see the margin expansion in the coming months i am especially pleased with our new orders performance in the second quarter and the resulting strong backlog which has strengthened our position for the periods ahead we also raised 94 million of net proceeds from our equity offering in may 2008 and appreciate very much the faith and confidence that our new and existing shareholders have placed on us
1811426 our adjusted ebitda and ebitda showed strong growth in the second quarter of 2008 over the second quarter of 2007 hughes gaap net income in the quarter was 1 8 million or 0 09 per share compared with 9 6 million or 0 50 per share on a fully diluted basis in the second quarter of 2007 the variance is primarily due to spaceway 3 satellite and network construction costs being depreciated starting in the second quarter of 2008 with the launch of commercial service on spaceway 3 in april 2008 this is in line with our expectations the successful equity offering has strengthened our balance sheet and our consolidated cash and marketable securities improved to 191 1 million at june 30 2008

1811447 nurse family partnership developed by david olds ph d director of the prevention research center for family and child health at the university of colorado denver
1811448 the programs aim was to give first born children from a disadvantaged background a better start in life the intervention consisted of nurses who visited the mothers of these children before birth and during the two years after birth
1811449 four hundred women who were awaiting the birth of their first child served as subjects eighty five percent were young unmarried or from low socioeconomic backgrounds half received the nurse family partnership intervention the other half served as controls receiving standard prenatal and well child care in a clinic of the children born to the 400 women 315 were available for follow up during the next 15 years
1811450 children of mothers who had received the intervention experienced significantly fewer arrests convictions and probation violations than did the children of controls

1811460 cpis business environment remained stable and our operations remained fundamentally strong in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 our sales increased and we generated strong cash flow and continued to pay down our debt during the quarter in addition we maintained our commitment to investing in cpis future by sustaining our high level of company funded and customer funded research and development activity
1811461 we remain solidly profitable and our operations continue to execute smoothly we are encouraged that after some softening earlier in the fiscal year our markets have remained steady and we are pleased by the continuing demand from customers for cpis products
1811462 our third quarter results contained no surprises and our business conditions have held steady in recent months
1811463 we do not anticipate significant changes to cpis business environment in the foreseeable future therefore we are leaving our previously issued guidance for fiscal 2008 unchanged

1811467 bruce we found mcbrain and he was the worst jazz drummer ever and we asked him what he knows to do best and he said i like to break things so then we were a band that breaks things ever since then weve been braking records all around the world and doing all kind of shit
1811468 i have a fobia that someones always there fear of the dark
1811469 if you have the chance go fucking see iron maiden live
1811470 we know hes not as good on fast ground so all we can do is wait im a patient man and if it keeps raining i think hell be rewarded hes a very progressive horse
1811471 that brigadier gerard was better than a group three in my opinion and i think smokey oakey has the scope to be a group two horse if he is running on very soft ground
1811472 dame judi is a marvellous marvellous person and she loves racing
1811473 from when she was a young girl she has always loved ponies and horses two or three years ago she said mark id better have one with you and smokey oakey is the horse which she owns in partnership with agar hes won five races and weve even had a big offer for him
1811474 it was after hed won a handicap at ayr on heavy ground off a handicap mark of 86 last year we discussed it and i told dame judi and bryan that i thought the horse would probably improve with another years racing so they decided to keep him which is wonderful
1811475 the bible does not address the matter of appropriate behaviour for those who are for whatever reason homosexual by instinct or nature
1811476 by the end of the 80s i had definitely come to the conclusion that scripture was not dealing with the predicament of persons whom we should recognise as homosexual by nature
1811477 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had the about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
1811478 the church has shifted its stance on several matters notably the rightness of lending money at interest and the moral admissibility of contraception so i am bound to ask if this is another such issue
1811479 if i am really seriously wrong on this i can only pray to be shown the truth
1811480 treating it as the sole or primary marker of christian orthodoxy
1811481 clearly he is in a conflicted situation while holding these personal convictions with the job description of the archbishop of canterbury to uphold the teaching of the church
1811482 it puts him in an untenable position that he has neither fulfilled the expectations of those who share his beliefs on this matter to their considerable disquiet and that his understanding of the concerns of the orthodox has not been met by the appropriate action its an impossible situation
1811483 its no secret and no small matter that a significant part of the tension in the anglican communion is being played out in the heart of its leader
1811484 even if he formally holds to the churchs teaching that he personally disagrees with one cannot but wonder whether his personal views affect the ways in which he tries to resolve difficulties
1811485 as well as developing my coaching skills its an exciting opportunity to gain first hand knowledge on the best young players coming through the system
1811486 im very happy with him and think hes still on the upgrade
1811487 im here to represent my country as best as i can and my objective is to win a medal for spain
1811488 its a very very special experience its unforgettable to be in the olympic village with all the elite athletes that we only otherwise see on television to be with them there is a really marvellous feeling
1811489 i am very proud that lucy is getting involved with something like this
1811490 its a good cause for human rights and for democracy its also a totally non violent movement the protesters are not saying they hate the chinese or the government but are just trying to bring some very dire human rights abuses to the worlds attention
1811491 the whole world is watching china so i doubt while she is in detention they will do anything drastic
1811492 i knew very roughly what she was going to do there but i obviously didnt know the exact details i knew she would be protesting but that was all she said she was allowed to tell us
1811493 we did get a text directly from him saying he was fine and he was being treated well and that was about an hour after his detention
1811494 of course i am worried about his safety he has been detained by the police we knew he was going out to protest he is passionate about the tibetan human rights situation he wanted to do this and we have fully supported him we are behind him all the way
1811495 it will probably be one of the two or three most disappointing back to school seasons this decade
1811496 it will be very promotional consumers are more cash and credit constrained than any other time in u s history
1811497 we assume its going to be a very difficult customer environment so from a sales and promotions standpoint well be extremely competitive
1811498 frankly it smacks a little bit of desperation to me
1811499 wal mart has a captive audience because of the food they sell people are already there so its a little easier for them
1811500 i just dont have the disposable income i had last year
1811501 i will purchase a new backpack from wal mart with all her school supplies but nothing else will be new at the beginning of the school year
1811502 we recognized pretty early on the economic environment had taken a bit of a shift
1811503 we looked at what people are experiencing pain at the pump pain when we go to the grocery store
1811504 if we had been in the situation of a new team being put together we could have said ok these things happen but we have been a year together and have experienced tough situations
1811505 it seems ridiculous to reach a european final and then go out at this stage but we never felt comfortable at all anyway it would be an excuse to refer to the effects of last season we share credit and we share failure
1811506 this is as low as you can be there isnt one word to describe how i am feeling
1811507 we worked so hard although we never played as well as we can
1811508 getting selected for the olympics at my age was exciting enough but now to be asked to carry the flag by my fellow competitors is the icing on the cake
1811509 i am just blown away by the decision it was a big surprise
1811510 one thing ive always argued about english coaches is that not enough are working abroad im here for the longer term i have been six weeks with this team and we are looking to the future
1811511 i really dont know and i dont care i know what i am who i am and the most important people to me are those around me those ive worked with people have called me up to say we admire you because of the gamble youve taken i dont see it like that i see it as a challenge although ive had success and ive managed england i still have a lot to learn
1811512 you can never have everyone you want but we have a good group of players to work on
1811513 in this league you have to work with a limited budget i dont want to complain it is part of life part of the game ill just get on with what it
1811514 if my team play entertaining football and i get sacked after nine games do you think i would be a happy man
1811515 as a manager you are always under pressure i will need a lot of luck but that is part of life
1811516 thanou will not attend the committee hearing and neither will her legal team we will send a memo instead
1811517 we are being asked to answer charges that are vague they should at least tell us which exact rules she is accused of breaking
1811518 being called to a hearing without being able to prepare counter arguments is contrary to all legal procedure
1811519 the ioc has no jurisdiction to judge the court procedure in greece there is no conviction there and in all likelihood she will be acquitted
1811520 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury
1811521 he said he was not going to face the death penalty but instead had a plan to kill co workers and other individuals who had wronged him

1811523 ive been in touch with the charities and it doesnt look like they have received any of the money that was meant for them
1811524 you just really feel bad for your guests that they have to go through all of this with you when it was meant to be a really happy time
1811525 were angry and were upset as far as were concerned it is our guests money they want to support us in our life together and wrapit and potentially hsbc have stolen that from us its not good enough
1811526 some of these new grooms and brides its their first time setting out in life gifts are supposed to be there to help them on their way
1811527 its a disappointment a let down wrapit is supposed to deliver and they havent hsbc who knows we just want to see some justice
1811528 frankly we are so ridiculously embarrassed on behalf of all of our guests and loved ones the people we care about the most are the ones who basically funded this company thats gone under and the bank are not willing to honour the debts
1811529 we feel there is a solution on the table that the bank can adopt but theyre just refusing to do so and we want to encourage them to adopt it and do the right thing
1811530 im not worried because its all you guys in the media
1811531 im not saying anything im just preparing myself to compete as fast as i can i havent said anything about breaking any record my goals havent been published they are known only to bob bowman his coach and myself
1811532 the only person i can control is myself i know im clean and i cant control what everyone else does so i dont worry
1811533 i dont plan on going because i compete the next day
1811534 i pretty much stay in my room all day watching movies theres not a lot else to do
1811535 im just messing around with the facial hair it might go before the first race it might not im having fun here thats what its about not many people get to represent their country at an olympics i intend to enjoy it
1811536 eu espero que o governo se decida se o secret rio rui costa o respons vel pela rela o do governo com os deputados ou se vai ficar usando a m quina do governo em favor de seus candidatos nestas elei es
1811537 its going to be very important that we play good cricket and entertain thats what the message is and were going to try to enjoy it and make sure we let our natural ability and flair take over
1811538 i am incredibly disappointed on behalf of my guests they are so upset
1811539 my husband was recovering documents from the kitchen and we thought we had ten minutes until the brook broke its banks
1811540 the waters met in our lounge there was a whoosh of water and a geyser effect there was a crashing from the kitchen as water dislodged pots pans and moved furniture the furniture blocked his egress
1811541 i was really frightened that he was going to drown i kept shouting but there was no response
1811542 i was wearing a floating suit i left the boat and approached him i spoke to him but he didnt appear to understand
1811543 i managed to make him understand that my suit would keep both of us afloat i supported him under his armpits we lifted him into the boat with help from a neighbour
1811544 july 20 is a date burnt into the memories of all those people affected by the floods
1811545 floodwaters carry with them all sorts of toxic elements it passed through fields where animals were grazing and defecating and came up through sewers and drains it is hardly surprising that people who swallow water like that are placed at risk
1811546 wherefore the lord commandeth you when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation because of this secret combination which shall be among you
1811547 labour have said over and over again that they will improve cleanliness in our hospitals but these figures clearly show that they are failing it is difficult for health service estates to maintain a completely pest free environment but the level and variety of these infestations is concerning
1811548 were not claiming that there has been some change over time because there is no previous data
1811549 these figures must be put into context it goes without saying that as the fourth largest trust in the country our hospitals are bigger than most others around the country and therefore our figures should be compared with trusts with similar sized estates rather than smaller acute trusts
1811550 cleanliness and hygiene are issues of critical importance to patients and the public we receive a wide range of information on hygiene from different sources however concerns around pest control have to date been negligible
1811551 clearly in a small minority of cases these infestations are actually impacting directly on the areas where patients are present
1811552 his brand of cricket is going to have to change with the style of play that he wants the team to play
1811553 you can do those things until you bump your head and the pressures on and you need to win series and win tests
1811554 knowing the man like i think we do hes going to be trying to prove to everybody that he can
1811555 but for him its going to be about finding the balance where he can marry the two of his captaincy and batting
1811556 i think theres certainly a lot more responsibility in terms of having to walk the walk with your team
1811557 you are always asking a lot of your players demanding a lot from their performances and thinking and you have to do that yourself that will come in time
1811558 its in time when you need to sustain your success
1811559 he has some tough challenges ahead hes got to develop a team pretty quickly and decide on what his style of play will be
1811560 nor is there a clear case for an immediate increase in the bank rate
1811561 xstrata believes that lonmins operations are attractive but that a significant transformation of operating and management practices is required to return lonmin to its former growth trajectory
1811562 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1811563 we sense a lack of approach to lonmin shows the disdain xstrata have in the incumbent management team and the very low value they place on getting a recommended offer
1811564 our proposed offer will provide lonmin shareholders with an opportunity to realise a cash premium for their investment which fully and fairly values lonmins operations and growth potential while acknowledging the risks time and investment involved in a turnaround of this scale and nature

1811617 for 2009 we expect prices to start coming under pressure as oversupply becomes evident in dubai we forecast a 10 per cent decline between 2008 and 2010 in our base case
1811618 while we expect these price declines to be limited to dubai given the level of undersupply in surrounding markets we cannot rule out a contagion effect on the middle east north africa property shares prices as investor confidence suffers
1811619 no i dont think so you have to take into account the population growth coming over 40 000 units are required each year to keep up with this in addition to the pent up demand from those people living in sharjah and ajman

1811629 i have never supported the brutal expulsion of all palestinians i have said repeatedly that the expulsion of the palestinians is immoral and impracticable
1811630 under some circumstances expulsion is not a war crime i dont think that the expulsions of 1948 of nearly a million palestinians were war crimes you cant make an omelet without breaking eggs you have to dirty your hands moreover if he israeli prime minister ben gurion was already engaged in expulsion maybe he should have done a complete job i know that this stuns the arabs and the liberals and the politically correct types but my feeling is that this place would be quieter and know less suffering if the matter had been resolved once and for all if ben gurion had carried out a large expulsion and cleaned the whole country the whole land of israel as far as the jordan river it may yet turn out that this was his fatal mistake if he carried out a full expulsion rather than a partial one he would have stabilized the state of israel for generations

1811638 irans leaders would do well to re think their gamble and suspend their nuclear program barring this the best they could hope for is that israels conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities to be sure this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation but the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland

1811712 el a o para el deporte espa ol ha sido fant stico venimos con humildad sabiendo lo dif cil que es conseguir lo que hemos hecho ser dif cil repetir una temporada como esta a veces cuando ocurre esto nos acostumbramos demasiado a las victorias y dejamos de valorarlas nos olvidamos de lo complicado que ha sido
1811713 para m el n mero uno es un triunfo bonito pero no tengo tiempo de disfrutarlo porque estoy en los juegos y esta es una experiencia nica y ahora s lo pienso en intentar hacerlo lo mejor posible
1811714 es una experiencia inolvidable estar aqu estar en la villa ol mpica con deportistas a los que ves por la televisi n es una experiencia maravillosa
1811715 el calendario de este a o es terror fico no he tenido tiempo de descanso s lo una semana despu s de wimbledon es un a o duro y dif cil y espero que los d as de entrenamiento sean suficientes para afrontar la competici n tengo que asimilar un cambio horario de doce horas pero los ltimos esfuerzos de la temporada son aqu y en estados unidos porque despu s la temporada vuelve a europa

1811719 while i was running an experiment at the caltech brain imaging center a group of students happened to pass by on a tour and i volunteered to explain what i was doing
1811720 as part of the experiment a moving display was running on my computer screen with dots rapidly expanding out somewhat like the opening scene of star wars
1811721 does anyone else hear something when you look at that
1811722 i queried a few hundred people and three more individuals turned up
1811723 do you hear sounds when you see things move or flash

1811725 we are ambitious for the future of superannuation but we cant do anything unless we do it within a responsible fiscal envelope

1811729 it is a fascinating thought that once upon a time a horse was born that turned gray and subsequently white and the people that observed it were so fascinated by its spectacular appearance that they used the horse for breeding so that the mutation could be transmitted from generation to generation
1811730 since the first description of melanomas in grey horses in 1903 researchers have questioned how a mutation causing loss of hair pigmentation can also cause melanomas our results suggest a possible explanation
1811731 we propose that the grey mutation stimulates growth of melanocytes and that this leads to a premature loss of the melanocyte stem cells needed for hair pigmentation whereas the mutation promotes an expansion of some of the melanocytes causing skin pigmentation
1811732 it is very likely that regulatory mutations like the one we found in these white horses constitute the dominating class of mutations explaining differences between breeds of domestic animals as well as between species like humans and chimpanzee
1811733 what we should be worried about is what the impact will be on this river lets not be worried about the political spin that this government keeps pushing out about how good this dam would be when clearly it doesnt stack up

1811735 most homeowners dont consider replacing their furnace unless it breaks down
1811736 but the reality is that replacing an inefficient furnace can help save hundreds of dollars on energy costs especially during the winter heating season this program is designed to make it easier for middle income families to replace their old furnace or boiler with one that meets a higher efficiency standard
1811737 with projected prices for heating oil this winter expected to be around 5 per gallon its important that we do all we can to be prevent what could be a crisis for many connecticut families id expect the demand for this rebate program to be very high over the next few months and i urge all of my qualifying constituents to take advantage of this opportunity very quickly

1811778 we are focused on improving operating efficiency and controlling costs during this period of weaker demand for our products our efforts to control selling administrative and general expenses and operating costs lessened the earnings impact of lower volumes and the effects of sharp increases in energy related costs on a comparable basis our selling administrative and general expenses in the second quarter were approximately 16 percent lower than the second quarter of 2007 this focus on cost control will make us a stronger company and improve our earnings leverage when volumes begin to recover additionally we reduced inventory levels of aggregates in the second quarter by reducing operating hours this planned action reduced second quarter earnings but increased cash generation and positions us for improved performance efficiencies going forward
1811779 pricing for our products remained strong and helped to mitigate the earnings effects of lower volumes and higher energy related costs

1811817 social media marketing the latest buzz on word of mouth
1811818 companies are enamored with the possibilities of social media marketing as the foundation for consumer driven referrals and brand advocacy
1811819 the challenge lies in identifying key influencers engaging them as brand evangelists and then tracking the impact of their words and actions over time social media marketing can also mean extending the reach of a brand through viral videos or by joining the conversation to that end companies need to understand peoples motivations for having a conversation and then contextually engage with that audience making marketing programs conversational and contextualized to niche audiences that naturally gravitate around a specific theme or shared passion is the essence of social media marketing and perhaps the future of marketing itself

1811830 this is the first time weve demonstrated a camera on a curved surface to really make it look like a human eye
1811831 if you simply bend it those materials are brittle like a ceramic bowl they break
1811832 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
1811833 currently when you take photos the middle part of the picture is very clear but when you go to the edge it is not so clear
1811834 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
1811835 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye
1811836 right now weve already got a camera working it works very well with computers its just how to connect the camera to the brain that is the issue to be solved

1811897 this is not about what costs might or might not be passed onto retail consumers
1811898 a lot of the things that we do in the community like our roadworks each community doesnt have an engineer so theres no point having one in our community because itll cost too much so what were trying to look at is a concept where we could share the resources in regards to service delivery
1811899 psa testing for all men between the ages of 40 and 50 years makes sense as it allows for early intervention if necessary
1811900 there is evidence now that if you were to give every man baseline psa tests in their 40s to see who is at risk you would be able to identify a sub group of men who are at high risk
1811901 if those men were followed carefully with repeat screenings their cancer would be found at an early curable stage
1811902 but evidence was still only strong enough to advocate testing on a case by case basis
1811903 some men can be over diagnosed and over treated suffering side effects like incontinence and impotence when their cancer may not have caused a problem and psa cannot reliably predict which is which
1811904 a large amount of cash is going to be given to the coal fired sector under the rudd governments green paper yet there will be no discount to consumers says total environment centre tec director jeff angel
1811905 theres a simple way out of this dont give the coal fired generators any subsidies
1811906 it wouldnt surprise me if it was being written into contracts now
1811907 penny wong and prime minister kevin rudd are set to join saddam hussein and the baathists of baghdad as only the second government in the world to have presided over the destruction of a ramsar listed wetland
1811908 an act of monumental environmental vandalism without precedent in australian history
1811909 what we should be worried about is what the impact will be on this river lets not be worried about the political spin that this government keeps pushing out about how good this dam would be when clearly it doesnt stack up
1811910 this further muddies those waters surrounding the proposed traveston crossing dam
1811911 thank you for contacting me about karl roves failure to appear before the judiciary committee i appreciate that you took the time to share your thoughts with me the judiciary committee is taking karl roves failure to testify very seriously and we are currently considering all options including contempt proceedings to compel him to answer important questions regarding the firing of several u s attorneys some have suggested that congress implement inherent contempt as if that is a viable option the jail cell in the basement of the capitol doesnt exist and the sergeant at arms is an over 60 year old executive congress is not a police force and we will likely need to continue to utilize the courts and system of justice to pursue these matters again thanks for being in touch please do not hesitate to let me know if i may ever be of assistance to you or your family
1811912 resolved that rooms a and b opposite the room of the solicitor of the court of claims in the capitol be and are hereby assigned as guardroom and office of the capitol police and are for that purpose placed under charge of the sergeant at arms of the house with power to fit the same up for purpose specified resolved that said wooley for his repeated contempt of the authority of the house be kept until otherwise ordered by the house in close confinement in the guardroom of the capitol police by the sergeant at arms until said wooley shall fully answer the questions above recited and all questions put to him by said committee in relation to the subject of the investigations with which the committee is charged and that meanwhile no person shall communicate with said wooley in writing or verbally except upon the order of the speaker
1811913 under the inherent contempt power the house sergeant at arms has the authority to take karl rove into custody and bring him to the house where his contempt case can be tried presumably by a standing or select committee if he is found by the house to be in contempt of congress he can be imprisoned for an amount of time determined by the house not to exceed the term of the 110th congress which ends the beginning of january 2009 or until he agrees to testify the supreme court has recognized the power of the house to enforce its own subpoenas through the inherent contempt provision stating that without it congress would be exposed to every indignity and interruption that rudeness caprice or even conspiracy may mediate against it before congress asked the justice department to try contempt cases on its behalf the inherent contempt power was used more than 85 times between 1795 and 1934 mostly to compel testimony and documents
1811914 both chambers also have an inherent contempt power allowing either body to hold its own trials and even jail those found in defiance of congress although widely used during the 19th century the power has not been invoked since 1934 and democratic lawmakers have not displayed an appetite for reviving the practice
1811915 u s code title 2 the congress chapter 6 congressional and committee procedure investigations sec 193 privilege of witnesses no witness is privileged to refuse to testify to any fact or to produce any paper respecting which he shall be examined by either house of congress or by any joint committee established by a joint or concurrent resolution of the two houses of congress or by any committee of either house upon the ground that his testimony to such fact or his production of such paper may tend to disgrace him or otherwise render him infamous

1811926 im a fan of sport literature but i like stories like friday night lights that are about more than just sports this is more of a social piece not just about baseball and how the town rallied around its team but about the heyday of the coal industry and what happened when it dried up
1811927 a little old guy pulled me aside and said i appreciate what you had to say but you are incorrect he told me there were minor league teams in six cities id grown up in southern illinois and didnt know that i found it intriguing
1811928 in the late 40s during the peak of the coal age west frankfort had a bigger population than marion
1811929 it had a trolley and three movie theaters there were housing booms and construction because people were having trouble finding places to live money was flowing freely
1811930 they built the stadium in 1947 the team won the illinois state league championship in 1948 but attendance started slipping there was a big mine explosion in 51 the team folded the mine closed and the town shrank
1811931 i never knew it was such a hustling kind of place to drive through it now you wouldnt think that its bittersweet to see how its fallen on hard times i wasnt going to do a book but i fell in love with the story
1811932 theres a guy in my church who was a kid at the time and a vendor at the stadium
1811933 he was able to tell me what game days were like

1811943 the most common method of sternal closure remains sternal wire but this is not without problems especially in the larger patients
1811944 the patients often exert forces on the wires that can cause the wires to break pull through the bone or loosen which can lead to sternal instability infection and increased pain
1811945 one of the most surprising outcomes of the use of the sternal talon r was the reaction of the post operative nursing staff who commented that you could tell which patients had the sternal talon r as they were up and moving around quicker with less pain

1811980 it is indicative of our continued dedication to be the leading innovator in synthetic sports turf
1811981 according to this study the risk of injury due to increased stress on knee and ankle joints is elevated on artificial turf systems that have less fiber and more infill and have a greater potential for compaction
1811982 the good news is that breakthrough innovations such as the root zone in astroturfs gameday grass 3d represent a significant advancement in the evolution of synthetic turf making it much more realistic and forgiving than most of the standard artificial turf systems currently in use something that coaches athletic trainers and athletes should be very excited about

1812003 the law is not preventing racial profiling or giving departments a way to track it and hold people accountable for it
1812004 we want them to see to it that law agencies collect racial data its good for the agencies and its good for the public
1812005 in every town city and parish examined people of color were arrested at a higher rate than their representation in the population
1812006 in bunkie black people are 3 8 times as likely to get arrested as white people
1812007 there are two types of arrests discretionary and nondiscretionary where the officer has no say about arresting the person
1812008 if you lump those two together it will skew the statistics but does it show racial profiling i suggest it does not

1812054 this law is so sweeping that it makes it a crime for our clients to provide medical services to tsunami survivors in sri lanka and to provide assistance in human rights advocacy to the kurds in turkey
1812055 the humanitarian imperative comes first aid is given regardless of the race creed or nationality of the recipients and without adverse distinction of any kind aid priorities are calculated on the basis of need alone
1812056 for only a remote chance of affecting terrorist activity the us counterterrorism regime may be interfering with charitable work that would weaken the impetus for terrorist activity in the first place

1812063 i call her the grey lady because she is almost a ghost a spectre whose cries and screams continue to haunt those who heard her
1812064 this is one of the greatest lies of the 21st century

1812071 but unsanity cant be held liable for people that refused to install the most up to date software that they could get
1812072 due to reports on developer preview releases of mac os x leopard in internet forums apple has denied access to the final version of 10
1812073 if you screw around with system files you get what you deserve
1812074 if you screw around with system files you get what you deserve
1812075 yes i have been able to update to leopard and didnt encounter any problem no blue screen nothing
1812076 how the heck am i supposed to start my macbook you fools
1812077 we have a build internally that works with mac os x 10 5 so its a matter of days for the compatibility update
1812078 basically you chose to put your self interest of keeping your software installed
1812079 some myself included up until about 2 weeks ago actually have a leopard dvd sitting in their office without even opening it since 10 4 is the only way to use app enhancers
1812080 we are having a lot of problems but are working on it
1812081 hey guys we can see the light at the end of the tunnel
1812082 apple did some really funky shit with this last round of an os build and well get thru it but were stumped at the moment
1812083 making things work is harder than we thought due to some last minute changes apple made in the code maybe 2 possible three weeks we hope
1812084 hp plans to release the first major update until the end of december 2007 which will be focused on all in one and scanner drivers to provide scanning and faxing functionality until then scanning functionality is limited to certain hp products please refer to the next pages for details
1812085 please make sure you have application enhancer 2 0 3 or later installed before you upgrade to mac os x 10 5
1812086 and if you have already installed leopard do not install any preference panel that installs ape if you do your computer will not be able to restart
1812087 we are hard at work getting application enhancer ape and our haxies compatible with mac os x 10 5 leopard weve been so delayed because ape didnt even run until we received the shipping version of leopard unsanity has 9 shareware products and about 4 free products that must work in leopard and ape requires some of these other products be updated first we will release ape when we feel it is ready and not a moment before but we will not be posting further status updates until then
1812088 insanity is repeating the same thing over again and expecting different results
1812089 ever since leopard was released dozens of inquiries about shapeshifters status have been made by forumgoers artists and even some of our own staff and two months in we have yet to get an official update from unsanity on its status however the idea of simply updating shapeshifter is a colossal effort and fundamental changes by apple to the way aqua works means that while its not coming soon the new shapeshifter will be groundbreaking for gui customization
1812090 we will release ape when we feel it is ready and not a moment before but we will not be posting further status updates until then

1812097 we continue to generate strong operating results and are achieving our goals regarding improving same store margins our second quarter produced our highest margins to date and our margin growth continues to be one of the strongest in the industry our positive operating results were somewhat tempered by the severe flood damage to our center in terre haute indiana i am very proud of how our employees quickly responded to this natural disaster to ensure a safe evacuation of all residents and employees from the center in a responsible and caring manner

1812111 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation
1812112 we are pleased with this earnings performance in this difficult gaming market environment
1812113 we had slightly improved earnings in the second quarter 2008 in spite of the 130 000 of other income in the second quarter 2007 primarily related to foreign currency exchange gains that did not recur in the second quarter 2008 this means on a comparative basis our earnings increased by around 140 000 on reduced sales the main contributing factors to this performance was the reduction in operating expenses of approximately 330 000 due to tight controls and the reduction in interest expense of approximately 90 000 due to lower inventory levels and interest rates the sales decline was caused by a reduction of 1 7 million in non core amusement sales partly offset by the 9 3 growth in gaming sales margins were maintained in the second quarter 2008 at 16 1 compared to 16 4 in the first quarter 2008
1812114 the balance sheet has been considerably strengthened with debt being reduced to 5 2 million as of june 30 2008 compared with 7 4 million at june 30 2007 and 9 9 million at june 30 2006 as a result the debt has been reduced almost 50 percent in the past two years the company has generated 1 6 million of operating cash flow in the first six months of 2008 being the main reason interest expenses has been reduced by almost 150 000 in the first half 2008
1812115 considering we earned more in the first six months 2008 than we did in twelve months 2007 we expect the net earnings for the full year 2008 to be better than that of last year despite reduced sales we currently expect that sales for the full year 2008 will be in the upper fifty million dollar range slightly less than last year as the worldwide gaming slot machine market remains sluggish for a longer period of time than many had anticipated we will continue to aggressively control costs interest expense and inventory levels ahead of the expected rebound in the slot machine replacement market
1812116 our second quarter 2008 results reflect the leverage our quarterly performance can achieve when we achieve operational excellence our downstream performance greatly improved over the first quarter benefited from the seasonality of the refinery maintenance business and the strong market for field services and storage tanks we saw strong revenue in our upstream segment even after the effect of the spring break up in canada and our engineering segment continues to provide excellent returns executing high value added assignments our focus on risk management and improved processes and procedures has contributed to the improvement in execution as have the hard work and dedication of our employees we will continue to focus on our plan to grow willbros while managing for the best risk adjusted returns and improvement of our execution skills we believe the outlook for our business remains very positive and we continue to add backlog including recently announced significant project work in our pipeline construction operation in canada
1812117 we are very pleased with the growth we are achieving in revenue earnings ebitda and new orders particularly in light of uncertainty in worldwide economies
1812118 we are now benefitting from our investments in new product development evidenced by increased revenue and orders from emerging markets as highlighted by mtn south africas order for our dynamic sim allocation dsa solution we believe that dsa is a unique solution with very significant potential for higher margin growth dsa orders comprised 27 of our second quarter license and services bookings up from 10 in the first quarter this has helped drive a near record backlog entering the second half of 2008 positioning us for solid results through year end

1812172 agreed to seek new sanctions against iran over its nuclear program after the country failed to meet a weekend deadline to respond to an offer intended to defuse the dispute
1812173 develop either a nuclear bomb or the ability to make one even if it has not decided to build one right now
1812174 same technology used for producing fuel for nuclear power can be used to enrich the uranium to a much higher level for producing fuel for a nuclear explosion
1812175 at a minimum is keeping open the option to develop nuclear weapons
1812176 because of intelligence gaps doe and the nic assess with only moderate confidence that the halt to those activities represents a halt to irans entire nuclear weapons program
1812177 iran probably would use covert facilities rather than its declared nuclear sites for the production of highly enriched uranium for a weapon

1812187 kosovars used to identify with the palestinians because we albanians are muslims and christians and we saw serbia and israel both as usurpers of land

1812225 there are two democratic party conventions in chicago in august of 1968 one is inside the international amphitheater with banners and placards and gavels and speeches the other is in the streets and parks of mayor richard daleys city with tear gas and rocks and mace and clubs and most of all with blood and the cloud marked vietnam hangs over both tangling them together
1812226 the issue is whether or not the democratic convention is going to vote today to continue to kill american boys in south vietnam we cant possibly justify this killing of our boys we gotta have a change in policy and i hope the democratic party will take advantage of the opportunity to unite the party and theyll never unite this party unless they change the policy in vietnam
1812227 thanks to the pacifica radio archives this generation can listen to the sounds of chicago 1968 the speeches the sirens the police clubbing that carry an eerie resemblance across the decades to this time to this illegal and unjustified war and to these places st paul and denver where peace and justice advocates will be out in the streets keeping the bill of rights alive pacifica was there for us then and pacifica is there for us now you cant say the same for the mainstream media
1812228 out on the streets pacifica reporters were in their element covering the quickly changing action the fiery speeches and the violence throughout the 1960s in pacifica radio one name seemed always be connected to the biggest events of that decade pacifica produced an award winning documentary called a night in chicago about the events outside the convention that summer in 1968 this recording is universally acknowledged as one of the most quintessential pacifica programs in the archives collection

1812256 a person of interest is not an official designation it is abused law enforcement is politics those in power use the term to assure the public that theyre doing something police authorities fear admitting that they literally have no clue who committed a crime
1812257 unfortunately these politicians trash lives along the way the person of interest is someone against whom there is no real evidence but someone who can be at least for a time used vilified scapegoated its time our law enforcement politicians learn to say no comment and for them to educate the public that very often especially at the beginning of a case police have no idea who the perpetrator was or at least no real evidence the public should want responsible action and restraint not simply action the media should also cease its complicity in this charade and rigorously question politicians who finger someone as a person of interest asking what evidence the police have to support their grave allegation otherwise naming someone a person of interest cheaply serves many of the same cynical purposes that show trials serve in totalitarian regimes
1812258 the person of interest phenomenon is something like the opposite side of the coin from terrorist watch lists in the name of improving public safety government authorities want to create some status for suspicious seeming individuals that would enlarge governments investigative power without triggering the civil liberties protections that go with identifying anyone as an actual criminal suspect so far it is not at all clear how much safety the public is getting out of the shift to a preventive law enforcement mentality there is a substantial risk that we will wind up less free but actually no safer
1812259 but alas in our day this life is unknown throughout the world it is neither preached about nor sought after we are altogether ignorant of our own name and do not know why we are christians or bear the name of christians surely we are named after christ not because he is absent from us but because he dwells in us that is because we believe in him and are christs one to another and do to our neighbors as christ does to us

1812273 meu primeiro pensamento quando vi o filme com meus filhos e ouvi o tom de abertura do mac foi que sutil
1812274 a apple est presente mas n o de forma direta trata se de um grande exemplo de como patrocinar um filme este modelo pode ser denominado product homage e tem mais valor do que o product placement refor a toda uma gama de produtos da apple desde o macbook at o ipod e o iphone
1812275 get out of the way dummy youre going too slow
1812276 now look what youve done stupid youve ruined every bit of information on the whole internet

1812278 i tell convention planners that if we can host an olympic games we can host anything
1812279 one of the best presentations ive seen at an iabc conference tod maffin did an awe inspiring job explaining the impact of the social web to a packed ballroom of communicators having them laughing while simultaneously terrifying them
1812280 podcaster blogger and cbc radio broadcaster tod maffin provided a roll in the aisles funny case for the power of social media solid ideas illustrated by real world examples i just couldnt stop laughing long enough to catch up with maffins delivery
1812281 my mind is still buzzing with todays outstanding lunchtime presentation by tod maffin and his powerfully honest insight into the power of the geek when avenging poor customer treatment
1812282 cable companies will become the power brokers of real time viewing habit information
1812283 they reduce drop ad inventory to add more station promos reminding viewers that you are watching us
1812284 but nicole that will take a long time for that kind of initiative
1812285 we wanted to ask the question in the global sense what is the genetic dictionary of the west nile virus
1812286 you dont need to destroy the whole bridge to stop a car going across it
1812287 we wanted to ask the question in the global sense what is the genetic dictionary of the west nile virus
1812288 for the most part the rna screens in the past have been done with fruit flies
1812289 we wanted to go as close to human cells as possible
1812290 about 40 or 50 of the 300 were common between the two experiments we hope there are others in common with several if not the majority of flaviviruses

1812294 the sting of the webswarm crisis communications in the age of blogs
1812295 if the internet is like a swarm then sometimes good buzz can quickly turn into bad buzz and you can get stung tod will introduce your delegates to both the swarm culture and both the danger and opportunities in blogs and podcasts
1812296 the space where this file is is now available for other data
1812297 no its not possible at all theres a lot of folklore and voodoo afoot about the ability to read trace data but theres simply nothing there that can be put back into anything intelligible
1812298 you can connect it to 2 tvs for separate viewing and recording on each tv
1812299 82 this new satellite is ten degrees lower on the horizon which makes it more difficult for dishes to find
1812300 thats right that means you dont get any service from us
1812301 the time for action is now in fact it is past due pelosi and hoyer sent the congress on vacation while families are cancelling their vacations because of high gas prices
1812302 i call on david boswell to join me in signing a petition to let the democrat congressional leadership know that people and businesses are hurting and that kentuckians need and expect action to lower prices immediately
1812303 we the undersigned believe that gas prices are too high speaker pelosi has closed congress for a five week paid vacation without taking any action to lower gas prices we the undersigned have a simple demand call congress back madam speaker
1812304 the liberal congressional leadership is apparently beholden to the fringe element in their party that opposes expanded oil production in the united states it is time to put partisanship aside and allow a vote on a bill that offers a comprehensive solution including more domestic drilling greater conservation measures and investment in new technology
1812305 today congressman ron lewis is in washington joining the fight to bring the house back in to session as a constituent i am appreciative of his leadership and as a candidate for congress i pledge to continue his steadfast support for american energy independence
1812306 dass auch diejenigen empfangsger te mit denen rundfunkprogramme empfangen werden k nnen geb hrenpflichtig seien
1812307 in einem demokratischen land kann keine unternehmensleitung als zensor bestimmen was die besch ftigten lesen
1812308 detention treatment and trial of certain non citizens in the war against terrorism
1812309 determined that an extraordinary emergency exists for national defense purposes that this emergency constitutes an urgent and compelling government interest and that issuance of this order is necessary to meet the emergency
1812310 possible habeas jurisdiction over aliens held in guantanamo bay cuba
1812311 this quasi category created a universe of legal nihilism where human beings including us citizens can be disappeared detained incommunicado denied access to attorneys and regular courts tried by kangaroo courts executed tortured assassinated and subjected to numerous other manifestations of state terrorism
1812312 international treaties and federal laws on the treatment of individuals detained by the us armed forces in afghanistan the laws of armed conflict dont apply to the conditions of detention and the procedures for trial of members of al queda and the taliban militia
1812313 do not protect members of the al queda organization or the taliban militia
1812314 are not entitled to prisoner of war status for purposes of the geneva conventions of 1949
1812315 application of treaties and laws to al queda and taliban detainees
1812316 none of the provisions of geneva apply to our conflict with al qaida or taliban detainees in afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world
1812317 it meant theyd be afforded no protection under international law and could be treated any way authorities wished including use of torture as was later learned
1812318 military interrogation of alien unlawful combatants held outside the united states
1812319 enjoys complete discretion in the exercise of his authority in conducting operations against hostile forces
1812320 a monument to executive supremacy and the imperial presidency and a road map for the pentagon to avoid any prosecutions
1812321 unusual lack of care and sobriety in its legal analysis and it seemed more an exercise of sheer power than reasoned analysis
1812322 serious physical injury so severe that death organ failure loss of significant body functions or permanent damage
1812323 interpretation of the geneva conventions common article 3 as applied to a program of detention and interrogation operated by the central intelligence agency
1812324 a member or part of or supporting al qaeda the taliban or associated organizations who might have information that could assist in detecting mitigating or preventing terrorist attacks within the united states or against its armed forces or other personnel citizens or facilities or against allies or other countries cooperating in the war on terror
1812325 so small that he had to double up his limbs in the fetal position
1812326 alternately in suffocating heat and in a painfully cold room
1812327 bright lights and eardrum shattering sounds 24 hours a day
1812328 have an ongoing confidential dialogue with members of the us intelligence community and we would share any observations or recommendations with them
1812329 warned that the abuse at torture prisons constituted war crimes placing the highest officials in the us government in jeopardy of being prosecuted
1812330 members of armed forces who laid down their arms shall in all circumstances be treated humanely
1812331 without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees
1812332 fails to make clear whether cia authorized interrogation techniques are still permitted
1812333 as authorization to continue using techniques such as waterboarding stress positions hypothermia sensory deprivation and overload sleep deprivation and isolation it sends a powerful and dangerous message
1812334 the dark side the inside story of how the war on terror turned into a war on american ideals
1812335 the dark side is a dramatic riveting and definitive narrative account of how the united states made terrible decisions in the pursuit of terrorists around the world decisions that not only violated the constitution to which white house officials took an oath to uphold but also hampered the pursuit of al queda in gripping detail jane mayer relates the impact of these decisions us held prisoners some of them completely innocent were subjected to treatment more reminiscent of the spanish inquisition than the twenty first century
1812336 torture the official law of the land in all but name
1812337 hard line law and order stalwarts in the criminal justice system
1812338 error prone legal decisions whose preordained conclusions were dictated by addington
1812339 to override existing laws that congress had specifically designated to curb him
1812340 a course not only for our international response but also in our domestic constitutional relations
1812341 which tend to be suppressed because of the social and psychological costs of not doing so
1812342 not just about what was legal but what was moral ethical right and smart to do
1812343 fundamentally the drive for expanded presidential authority was about unlimited power
1812344 a deadly interrogation can the cia legally kill a prisoner
1812345 yet swanner wasnt charged and continued to work for the agency
1812346 fashioned secret legal guidelines that appear to indemnify cia officials who perform aggressive even violent interrogations outside the united states
1812347 its going to be vital to use any means at our disposal
1812348 the black sites a rare look inside the cias secret interrogation program
1812349 for decades governments allowed their officials access to detainees to insure that proper treatment was being maintained
1812350 tantamount to torture and responsible american officials could have committed serious crimes
1812351 if the full story of the cia program ever surfaced agency personnel could face criminal prosecution
1812352 at every stage there was a rigid attention to detail it was almost automated people were utterly dehumanized they fell apart it was the intentional and systematic infliction of great suffering masquerading as a legal process it is just chilling
1812353 were not going to kill you but were going to take you to the brink of your death and back
1812354 black masked commandos attached to the cias paramilitary special activities division
1812355 taken to their cells by strong people in black outfits masks that covered their whole faces and dark visors over their eyes
1812356 hog tied stripped naked photographed hooded sedated with anal suppositories amounting to sodomy placed in diapers and transported by plane to a secret location
1812357 tear clothing from them by firmly pulling downward against buttons and seams pulling detainees off balance
1812358 hear people knocking their heads against walls and doors screaming their heads off
1812359 im not interested in unfair justice even for bad people danny was such a person of conscience i dont think he would have wanted all of this dirty business i dont think he would have wanted someone being tortured he would have been repulsed
1812360 saw to it that some of the sharpest and best trained lawyers in the country working in secret in the white house and us department of justice came up with legal justifications for a vast expansion of the governments power in waging war on terror as part of the process for the first time in history the united states sanctioned government officials to physically and psychologically torment us held captives making torture the official law of the land in all but name
1812361 extralegal counterterrorism program presented the most dramatic sustained and radical challenge to the rule of law in american history
1812362 is like a graveyard where you place a dead person in a tomb
1812363 she behaved in an improper way she came very close with her whole body towards me
1812364 clearly at odds with the most basic norms of fair trial and due process
1812365 the president can pick up any person in the country citizen or legal resident and lock them up for years without the most basic safeguard in the constitution the right to a fair and speedy criminal trial
1812366 that evidence derived through waterboarding was off limits that should still be our policy to do otherwise is not only an affront to american justice it will potentially put prosecutors at risk for using illegally obtained evidence
1812367 unfortunately i was overruled and i resigned my position to call attention to the issue efforts that were hampered by my being placed under a gag rule and ordered not to testify at a senate hearing while some high level military and civilian officials have rightly expressed indignation on the issue the current state can be described generally as indifference and inaction military justice has a proud history this was not one of its finer moments
1812368 after trials we can truthfully call full fair and open in that service we must declare that evidence obtained by waterboarding be banned in every american system of justice
1812369 the us administration chooses ships to try to keep their misconduct as far as possible from the prying eyes of the media and lawyers we will eventually reunite these ghost prisoners with their human rights
1812370 by its own admission the us government is currently detaining at least 26 000 people without trial in secret prisons and information suggests up to 80 000 have been through the system since 2001 the us government must show a commitment to rights and basic humanity by immediately revealing who these people are where they are and what has been done to them
1812371 for the majority of private individuals the intolerable became tolerable
1812372 this administrations approach to security unfair out of control a waste of resources treating the rights of the innocent as an afterthought
1812373 portland is in the forefront of efforts to encourage more and safer cycling something of critical interest to every community in the nation as we address issues as varied as traffic safety climate change and the obesity epidemic
1812374 research based public policy why is it not the golden standard
1812375 evidence is important but only one small component of effective advocacy
1812376 global village provides an opportunity for people to not just attend the conference but to make it their own paying the high registration fee is something that only a privileged group of people can do the gv is free and open to all so everyone can take advantage of what this meeting has to offer the gv is a space where real people can talk about and work toward real solutions dialogue is possible here something thats not happening in the panel sessions
1812377 that ensures that there is a place in the conference to gather and express the leadership and knowledge of people affected and infected
1812378 acceptance is one of the keys to preventing hiv transmission
1812379 if your family thinks that youre worthless and disgusting will you really value your life and yourself will you really engage in sex practices that help to protect you if youre hiv will you really take your medications
1812380 this is a space where money and ones access to resources does not define ones access to information and opportunities for discussion
1812381 this space re energizes me there are so many ways that people are presenting information and helping others to understand their realities with art photography dance and not just through one way lectures here you can focus more on processes which are so important for creating alliances
1812382 this space is so important for us to connect to other people throughout the world its a space for the free flow of ideas and exchanges which doesnt happen in the panels
1812383 the global p e a c e coalition model teaming public private and faith sectors
1812384 take botswana which had one of the highest rates of hiv in southern africa and the government and international organizations put in strong prevention and treatment programs prevalence among teen girls dropped from 25 percent to 18 percent
1812385 weve not done better for women and girls in the fight against hiv aids because we have not respected their human rights from the beginning
1812386 in multi display hosted sessions our remote software offers a better multi monitor experience than integrated graphics
1812387 in addition to better handling of window positioning across multiple monitors administrators can auto program and configure desktop settings on a per user basis giving them more control when deploying multiple systems
1812388 there are more people arriving at the ers and there are fewer ers
1812389 it takes me a month to get an appointment for my own doctor and im a physician for gods sake
1812390 half of people had waiting times of 31 minutes or less
1812391 the er has become the front door to the hospital
1812392 millions more people each year are seeking emergency care but emergency departments are continuing to close often because so much care goes uncompensated
1812393 this report is very troubling because it shows that care is being delayed for everyone including people in pain and with heart attacks
1812394 portland is in the forefront of efforts to encourage more and safer cycling something of critical interest to every community in the nation as we address issues as varied as traffic safety climate change and the obesity epidemic
1812395 we need to be clear that this is the best researched disease in history we know what to do to prevent hiv infection but were not drawing a straight line between what we know and what we do
1812396 why do we need hiv to fight against sexual violence
1812397 mya nichole is kicking ass at table tennis she had some inside knowledge that billy sucks at it so mya challenges him to a quick match he loses and her plans to get in his pants are coming together he might not be able to return her serve but hell return the favor with some cum on her face

1812441 by government standards i am statistically speaking a failure of the system

1812447 when applied to customers who did not make any long distance calls the monthly fee was equivalent to an unauthorized increase to the residential local service rate
1812448 we can do better and were incredibly well placed to drive success in the region weve got to make sure we tailor our resource needs to the games we are making
1812449 were going to invest in more ways than we have before
1812450 there is additional value to the government for the additional fuel offload amount above threshold

1812485 how then do you compete against the cnns and the cbcs and the ctvs of the world who tell their audience when a big news event happens upload it to
1812486 in many cases we work with those news organizations like the associated press where were basically providing them with eyewitness reports there are cases where people will send to us because they feel like they have a greater chance of getting their side of the story told

1812516 the notion that more troops would mean more order i think is not a particularly controversial one
1812517 we can send 15 000 more troops 20 000 more troops 30 000 more troops i dont know any uh expert on the region or any military officer that ive spoken to privately that believes that that is gonna make a substantial difference on the situation on the ground
1812518 the best way to secure long term peace and security is to establish a stable prosperous and democratic state in iraq that poses no threat to its neighbors and contributes to the defeat of terrorists when iraqi forces can safeguard their own country american troops can return home

1812531 sir alex ferguson heard my arguments i heard his and in fact it was settled that the best for both parties would be for me to stay therefore i can confirm that next season i will play for manchester united
1812532 before rumours emerge saying that i will play against my will i want to make this clear whoever says or writes that is lying i will play for manchester with all my heart and soul i will fight and honour that shirt with the same commitment and dedication as always
1812533 i was responsible for all this controversy i was the one who publicly expressed my desire to go to real madrid i ended up being even involuntarily responsible for the poor relationship between the two clubs
1812534 i knew real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very high offer to manchester united my desire was for some time that manchester had accepted my transfer to madrid saying otherwise would be to trick people and my own consciousness

1812538 the concept of the hotel was born out of the owners love for contemporary art and the desire to revitalize downtown louisville
1812539 there is art everywhere within the 9 000 square feet of space
1812540 the property is easily accessible from the street and people walk in just to see the exhibits in fact there is one lady who works in the area and will park her car across the street to walk through the hotel on her way to work

1812543 has been such a fabulously good thing for the scrabble franchise that hasbro should have been celebrating
1812544 many copyright owners today are over inclusive as they try to assert their rights the question for hasbro is whether the benefit they get in terms of direct and indirect revenue from their own scrabble game exceeds the cost of negative publicity from this action but it certainly got them a black eye in the online community although most people who play scrabble have no idea this has happened
1812545 if someone had sold a board game called scrabulous that is just like scrabble then people wouldnt object to the company trying to shut it down as an infringer
1812546 so fundamentally i am not sure why this is a different situation
1812547 just because they think they have the right to instead of pursuing whats in their shareholders best interests
1812548 one is the downside they have created for themselves and the other is a lack of an upside
1812549 need to move aside from knee jerk tendencies to bring in legal action
1812550 it would have been smart to pay the agarwalla brothers millions of dollars that would have been minuscule compared to legal fees and their own application development expenses hasbro may have won the battle but it has surely lost the war
1812551 as the scrabulous matter is before the courts our lawyers have recommended that we do not appear in the media or give comments to the press as it might compromise the case
1812552 scrabulous is an amazing word game it is entirely web based at scrabulous you get a top notch rating system a state of the art game room and user profiles with images the interface exudes perfection minimalism and above all functionality
1812553 id be okay with you forcing out scrabulous if you had a decent application to replace it with
1812554 i am sure there will be conflicts because the boundaries are not too well defined
1812555 the theory of platform economics suggests that a platform operator actually has an incentive to facilitate the optimum level of activity on its platform
1812556 facebook benefits by having lots of applications even though the applications are making money and facebook isnt on the applications themselves it gets more users it gets more activity and so forth
1812557 a thoughtful approach here for facebook is not to see it necessarily as a conflict but to see the benefits the application brings
1812558 whats interesting on facebook is you have large venture funded startups that are staking their business on building applications on facebook and other social networking platforms
1812559 all the opportunities for application developers that were there prior to this are still there if you have an application that fits scrabulous has proven how popular some things can become by being hosted on a popular social networking site like facebook the fact that you need to have an original game where you have free and clear intellectual property doesnt mean that there is any less opportunity to take advantage of the reach the distribution and the built in platform features that social networking sites give you
1812560 we are very happy with the response wordscraper has received
1812561 it had the highest activity level among all applications on facebook on august 3 right now we are working on a number of new features and user requests primarily we shall improve the navigation and interface of the application
1812562 we are not sure whether scrabulous has been sued for copyright trademark or patent violation
1812563 clearly we are in fast changing times in this environment of social network platforms and there will be more equilibrium points that develop
1812564 its not necessarily obvious that there is a model that is a win win for everyone the shares of the rents from this market are not necessarily equal and the costs also are not exactly equal
1812565 the old adage that content is king no longer holds distribution is the ace in the hole
1812566 there are so many examples especially related to youtube where getting your offering out there to a wider audience is surely a good thing
1812567 we are at that turning point where this kind of hasbro action is becoming more the exception than the rule
1812568 well soon get to the point it may take years where this kind of thing will not happen
1812569 wir freuen uns mit focus online und dem nachrichtenmagazin focus zwei starke partner gewonnen zu haben diese partnerschaft erm glicht uns zuk nftig die darstellung von sehr detaillierten informationen ber rzte heilberufler und institutionen aus dem gesundheitswesen ein service der f r viele patienten von hohem wert sein wird
1812570 oliver samwer lukasz gadowski und suhas gopinath haben schon fest zugesagt
1812571 the whole mindset has been lets get rid of it
1812572 of course its a little risky to hold inventory that might lose value especially perishable goods and fashion oriented goods but to the extent retailers know that prices will be rising over time they will start to try to hold more inventory
1812573 what i expect is that sourcing from farther away becomes less attractive because the extra transportation costs are now going to swamp
1812574 i suspect that some retailers will start to consolidate their network closing marginal stores because theyre too expensive to supply given their low profitability
1812575 theresa lot of volatility right now and with a lot of volatility a retailer who typically runs with very small profit margins can go from making money to losing money pretty quickly
1812576 is going to require some experimentation and probably a lot of coordination between the two groups
1812577 for the wal marts of the world inflation is actually something pretty good because so many customers are trying to figure out how do i save money during these inflationary times and that takes them more and more to the value based retailers the costcos and wal marts and dollar stores should be thriving during such periods
1812578 the problem is not only that there are inflationary pressures but that aggregate demand is going down
1812579 thats why you see retailers like boscovs and mervyns in trouble because they may still be marking up their goods but theres not enough demand to keep the stores full
1812580 the smart way for the retailer to do it is to raise prices a little bit here a little bit there over time so that the consumer doesnt have one big sticker shock
1812581 in order to do that the retailer has to absorb some of the pain in the short run and eventually pass it on down and frankly the manufacturers are trying to absorb pain too because they dont want to be the one thats raising prices when their competitors arent
1812582 this is a way to hedge against future changes in the market
1812583 a prime choice is to emphasize their private label goods its their ace in the hole
1812584 it might be an opportune time to run some deep discounts as a way to try to capture some volume
1812585 its crafting and putting the best face on the value statement that youre making
1812586 those that do not cut back tend to have much bigger returns for their marketing spend in economic downturns than during times of prosperity
1812587 and thats a real surprise because you would think during prosperity people have money to spend and youre more likely to get a return for any of your marketing investment most marketing spending has an impact basis that is how much youre spending relative to your competition
1812588 companies with enough cash to boost spending on marketing can use a bad time as a period in which to focus on gaining more market share
1812589 retailers need to go out of their way to provide friendly customer service because everybodys going to be out there screaming value

1812596 whether this may apply to other similar kidney conditions and may translate into long term protection from renal function loss and the potentially life threatening complications remains to be established
1812597 obviously food safety is very important to us its a matter we take very seriously
1812598 the court came perilously close to shutting down turkeys democratically elected government
1812599 the case should be a wake up call to the government to resume the constitutional and human rights reform turkey so desperately needs
1812600 the government should now see the value of ensuring freedom of speech and association in turkey
1812601 but ensuring people in turkey actually secure these rights will only come through a new constitution tinkering with laws wont fix the problem

1812609 almost by definition a person who is leading change or transformation sits physically and metaphorically in the old world they are a part of and the new world they are trying to achieve
1812610 so many of the women in this program live in two worlds
1812611 those women are against my point of view about the rights of women in islam and they say i am too westernized this is hard
1812612 as a result many women who wear headscarves end up in jobs where they have no contact with the public such as call centers
1812613 i explained i was in charge of the team and the meeting started very coldly
1812614 when i go back to lebanon i am the american depending on how people there view american policy thats quite a complication
1812615 nelson mandela faced resistance from black south africans who did not buy into a gradualist non violent movement it was the same for gandhi and martin luther king
1812616 thats exactly why we consider them leaders their views transcended their need to be liked by others
1812617 if you look at a woman and she retreats under your gaze how will she lead
1812618 i see incredibly powerful passionate women in this room on the verge of change
1812619 i present this possibility it could be the dialogue with one another that changes you
1812620 where in the quran does it say that women and men must work separately
1812621 could you point out that the quran doesnt separate men and women and that they pray side by side in mecca
1812622 when it is time for tea or lunch every face turns in my direction
1812623 you as a leader need to speak up about the impact their assumption is having on your role in the team
1812624 we give these women a sense of community so they know they are not standing alone
1812625 research suggests that women have ambition but that it gets dissipated as they get older
1812626 i think as women face challenges to realizing their ambition they lose energy for it
1812627 i want to be a role model for them to show you can be successful and be religious at the same time
1812628 a muslim woman must prove not just that she is as good or better than a man but as good as a western woman
1812629 we are a minority so we have to perform very very well on the job
1812630 if you are morally and religiously empowered that gives you a different kind of confidence
1812631 you have to know with confidence that you can make a difference and more strongly that you should make a difference people in this program had a very high sense of calling and purpose
1812632 her narrative is professional but she brings in her personal family story talking about mental illness without a sense of shame
1812633 that relationship with her brother drove her career her leadership was embedded in something incredibly meaningful to her and thats very important to remember
1812634 i know women who have been left destitute after a divorce i want to educate muslim women about what rights they have in marriage and divorce
1812635 simply dont know whats going on with women in their communities
1812636 i like to choose the most expensive liquid on the planet
1812637 as sovereign wealth funds have grown they appear to be demonstrating an increasing risk appetite very little transparency and virtually no clarity of objectives
1812638 your appetite for risk should depend on the cash flow pattern of your expected liabilities until you undertake a good analysis of the liability stream you need to cover its impossible to know what you should be invested in in the majority of cases these funds dont report enough information to track their future liabilities so we cannot tell whether their investments are appropriately matched to future promises
1812639 new zealand is charging todays workers while theyre young so the young of the next generation wont be so heavily taxed when todays workers retire
1812640 the well managed funds are very explicit about where their money comes from and what their objectives are
1812641 theyre reporting the nature of their investments and the funds geographic diversification they issue quarterly reports and they protect the funds managers from political interference new zealands plan has even put in place guidelines for corporate responsibility outlining the way it will intervene or not in companies in which it invests and what types of assets it will or wont seek to hold it publishes a formal responsible investment policy manual which takes into account the environmental impacts and employment rights practices of companies in which it invests
1812642 new zealand has been explicit that its building this asset pool now in the hope that it will help to buffer future pension payments
1812643 it takes resolve to be that unambiguous about intergenerational tradeoffs
1812644 what happened was that the pool of assets started to build up and it was too tempting politicians increased benefits and reduced the retirement age
1812645 one group didnt want investments in companies that werent green
1812646 another was worried about companies that shipped jobs overseas at the time it became quite clear that it would be difficult to insulate a u s government investment board from these kinds of pressures this may be one reason that the australian future fund will eventually steer all of its money outside of the country
1812647 it is often the case that investors like to keep their strategies close to the vest so as not to be preempted
1812648 enhanced pension reporting including making annual reports on financial actuarial statistical and investment information to stakeholders can improve returns by 2 1 percentage points annually
1812649 the european commission is drafting a plan to prohibit non european union members from investing in the european energy business
1812650 german chancellor angela merkel has mentioned designing a system similar to that implemented in the u s where a governmental committee on foreign investment must review and approve foreign based investments that might be deemed a threat to national security such financial protectionism might be avoided if these publicly managed investment pools were made more transparent clearer in their objectives and more accountable to their many stakeholders
1812651 these public pools of assets managed by governments are growing dramatically just when financial markets seem particularly fragile
1812652 the concern is that they seem to foretell a return to global financial socialism when governments direct these large pools of money without being transparent about their objectives or their methods this makes many politicians and financial experts nervous
1812653 and fuel costs feed into just about everything which means that raw materials prices and food prices should continue to stay high too
1812654 investing in efficiencies can relieve pricing and competitive pressures for businesses
1812655 we saw about 3 9 billion invested in the sector in 2007 in north america alone more than triple the investment in 2002 its the third largest venture sector now behind it and life science
1812656 were seeing an accelerating rate of business formation and greater deal flow and exit opportunities
1812657 and the pool of seasoned entrepreneurs and experienced executives entering the space is increasing
1812658 if you take every cent of venture capital thats been invested in the history of the category it nearly equals one week of exxons revenue
1812659 there are many things that you can do right now to reduce carbon emissions without great cost that pay for themselves almost immediately weve recently added three insulation technologies to our portfolio
1812660 at lighting science were trying to do well by doing good and were doing it one light point at a time
1812661 all of the streetlights in new york city are being redesigned with leds
1812662 we have to reduce greenhouse gases by 90 by 2050 to keep the temperature rise to just 2 degrees celsius
1812663 most people think thats impossible i think we can get there but we have to start today in europe theyve already started lights go off when you leave a room even if you dont turn them off
1812664 perhaps because were an island we like offshore turbines and things bobbing in the water
1812665 when youre in the sea you have to think about things like how quickly the equipment rusts how youre going to maintain it and how much thatll cost
1812666 some large companies are paralyzed with fear their strategy is called wait and see and let someone else go first thats fine with us the landscape is wide open and theres a tremendous land grab going on in lighting and lighting controls
1812667 we had this chocolate manufacturer and we were able to show them that two thirds of their cost base was energy related costs are risks cost analysis can have a big impact in a corporate context
1812668 although the early use of p2p networks was for digital piracy p2p networks are increasingly being used for legitimate content distribution including music video and software
1812669 for example grooveshark rvibe we7 and imesh are firms that use p2p networks to distribute music to users the music is licensed from the music labels the files are distributed from users machines and the p2p firms provide software and billing a number of technologies have also emerged to prevent piracy in p2p networks as a result distribution of digital products through p2p networks is likely to become more prevalent
1812670 diffusion models for peer to peer p2p content distribution on the impact of decentralized constrained supply
1812671 rvibe pays 5 cents for a 99 cent track grooveshark has recently changed its policy but i think it was originally 10 cents a song our conclusion is that you want to offer really high payments early on and that payments shouldnt be fixed we found in many cases that the referral payment could be higher than the price for example you might initially pay 1 50 for a 99 cent file
1812672 the initial high payment brings in a lot of distributors and it gets them to share files when theres scarcity
1812673 the optimal strategy seems to be to price the product low at first and pay the majority of the amount collected to the p2p distributor
1812674 so initially your profits are lowest over time you increase your price and reduce your referral payments
1812675 in the past it was difficult to do customized pricing
1812676 the music industry has generally been one that was slow to adapt
1812677 an apple has the capital and expertise to manage that but not everyone does
1812678 allows a firm to efficiently distribute media at a relatively low cost
1812679 further the distribution infrastructure automatically scales as new consumers join the network
1812680 apple is going to find it impractical to negotiate deals with a lot of independent unknown artists while with a grooveshark or rvibe the independent artist signs up for the service creates an account and uploads his songs
1812681 apple isnt going to want to negotiate contracts with a bunch of unknowns
1812682 but i do think its here to stay i recollect a statement that i read in early 2000 where somebody said p2p was a solution in search of a problem thats moot now
1812683 the revenue generated from these advertisements goes to artists labels and other rights owners
1812684 you get music for free and the artist gets fairly paid
1812685 all of the cmbs issued this year were underwritten in 2007 and only got unloaded this year
1812686 took a huge hit around the same time as the credit crunch last august
1812687 the blowup in the housing market affected the commercial market mostly for not very good reasons most commercial loans on shopping centers office buildings and the like had nothing to do with the residential side some contamination was not justified and the result was a dramatic widening in spreads i think though there is one good fundamentally based reason why cmbs went down
1812688 in 2006 and 2007 in particular the underwriting deteriorated loan to value ratios went up and debt service ratios went down people decided that there was too much commercial mbs out there
1812689 it was good for everybody instead of pension companies writing a mortgage where you could suffer a loss on a direct loan in securitization you could layer the risk if you dont want much risk you could buy a triple a loan and then there are a lot of classes below that which would suffer first the market opened up a pool of potential investors and over the years as more came in they recognized it as a very stable asset class between 1995 and 2007 there have not really been any major defaults in cmbs
1812690 in a commercial property you have to underwrite what you think the cash flows are
1812691 when katrina hit it proved how resilient and diversified the asset class was
1812692 three states were basically knocked out of line with thousands of properties devastated defaults climbed substantially but they still never reached 1 that tells you something bond investors suffered only incidental losses on the lower rated classes but they were all prepared for this when katrina hit they knew right away what would be problematic
1812693 there were some that didnt need amortization mezzanine financing debt that can be converted to an ownership stake was widely available and you could buy commercial property for close to no money down in some places anything that was structured investors were buying
1812694 we got into a situation where there was so much demand for yield that you could end up with a poorly underwritten product and there would be some bond desk out there that would buy it thats going to go away
1812695 it clearly is going to matter more to investors who they are
1812696 i honestly dont know but somethings got to change because they failed and that process failed
1812697 more likely is that they would only rate simple more transparent issues that also tells you what cmbs will look like in the next few years simpler better underwritten regular cmbs as opposed to more complex collateralized debt obligations
1812698 cmbs is probably the most transparent structured finance market that exists
1812699 you do your due diligence based on data and how it did historically in cmbs the data set is relatively robust and at the end of the day you still have a property that generates income
1812700 compared to their fair value and returns relative to their risk
1812701 i dont see how this is going to get them anywhere close
1812702 i dont see any great synergies appearing out of this
1812703 microsofts search is as good as googles but nobody knows it or believes it
1812704 will strengthen our competitive position in the convergence of search and display
1812705 we see this as a natural extension of efforts we have already made toward an open marketplace
1812706 will strengthen our competitive position in the convergence of search and display
1812707 early figures from the second quarter indicate little immediate or sustained improvement in the core ad economy
1812708 what happens is that the current economic crisis puts pressure on advertisers to save money and find more effective marketing channels
1812709 effectively the crisis accelerates the shift of advertising budgets from traditional media into new media
1812710 im always dismayed when people use overall spending as an indicator for measuring online or offline advertising
1812711 it not only crowds out those classifieds it appears to be more efficient
1812712 two years ago 20 of our ads had some video component to them now its more like 50
1812713 if you can have a mini web site within an ad its a lot more powerful than having the user clicking off
1812714 the new into old models a shotgun wedding at best
1812715 tend to be longer term more about developing a two way relationship than a single transaction
1812716 they provide high information content and seek to alter the users perceptions
1812717 we really got the audience and then stumbled onto the idea for the business model
1812718 fun and meaningful to the gaia community as well as beneficial to sponsors
1812719 focus on making the user experience great making it so good that people will want it if you can do that youll acquire an audience if you can attract a really big audience that unlocks every business model
1812720 you dont have to think about every application making money
1812721 push the product early so we could test and be realistic about what customers really wanted
1812722 theres usually a point where you face a courage and esteem crisis as to whether the product is really good enough to ask someone to pay for it but when it comes to monetization id advise doing it early
1812723 despite the recent decline in crude oil prices refining margins specifically for gasoline continue to be weak efforts to optimize our refining system in the third quarter will focus on expanding to our slate of light sweet crude oils to include those that trade at lower prices while running our crude units at rates that reflect the current challenging market conditions
1812724 once you have the perk to take it away is seen as a violation of a psychological contract you have with your employee
1812725 i put it in our annual report in the tiniest type i could find
1812726 boards were pushing back on some of these perks because they thought they didnt look good
1812727 but i think that passed and now the issue is whether these practices are important in recruiting and retaining people if the economy softens there will be push back again we did see that when the economy softened in 2001
1812728 if you are taking anything away from employees its important to explain the need for doing it
1812729 it helps a lot if the need is something driven by factors outside the firm the need to improve share price isnt going to satisfy a lot of people
1812730 i do not recommend taking away perks but if a company has to management needs to remember that taking things away from people almost always leads to feelings of unfairness
1812731 if management does such a thing it has to be very sure to explain very very clearly why it was necessary in a way that seems fair to the employees
1812732 its hard to say they were deliberately trying to exclude people at lower levels
1812733 it seems to me that the emphasis was on quality and wanting to provide an excellent opportunity for employees it just came at a higher cost
1812734 we found that while perks have this perception that they are excess our results showed that while there may be excess at the extremes on average there seems to be evidence that firms offer perks to enhance the productivity of executives
1812735 many of those spouses dont view it as a vacation
1812736 there are a lot of what the sec calls perks that frankly the person receiving them would say thanks for nothing
1812737 you see big numbers related to security systems but the individual would probably say id rather have the cash thank you
1812738 just because of the emotional connection he or she has to the perk theres an alchemy to choosing the right perks
1812739 in the old days the management team was made up of older white men who all wanted the same thing
1812740 now some people with young kids value supplemental child care over membership at the club
1812741 often you have to keep these deals quiet so others dont feel their own deal is bad
1812742 we have seen an expansion into voluntary benefits as the costs of health care and traditional benefits are rising employers are looking to provide at no cost to them something thats perceived of as valuable to the employee
1812743 it is worth considering the extent that employees trade pay for perks
1812744 absent tax benefits employees may prefer cash to perks and may be willing to take a dollar reduction of perks for a less than dollar increase in pay
1812745 perks are not the only thing companies need to make it
1812746 it is 10 times easier to withhold than to withdraw
1812747 what could be more relevant than hearing about leadership from someone in the middle of a multitude of challenges
1812748 dealing with greater challenges while at the same time your stock price is down is more difficult than you can imagine but deal we must persevere we must
1812749 a better tomorrow as this cycle inevitably bottoms out and turns upwards
1812750 the economy was strong and most economic forecasts did not suggest a deep housing decline the prevailing thinking was that only a handful of companies would be significantly impacted primarily the small mortgage lenders out west and orange county california seemed like a long way from philadelphia
1812751 has turned into a raging housing credit and capital markets storm of global proportions
1812752 it is a storm that has engulfed many large and small companies and a storm whose passing is likely to permanently alter the housing credit and risk markets in ways that remain to be seen
1812753 he never complained about his uncles having spent his inheritance instead he focused his energies on what he could do positively and built a successful business from scratch
1812754 we have a choice we can either complain about our circumstances and the unfairness of those circumstances and allow them to paralyze us or we can focus on continuing to move our companies forward
1812755 is that you could do seemingly impossible things if you accepted the fact that you had no choice but to do them as we leaders face our own doubts and the doubts of our colleagues and as we face seemingly possible situations we can either surrender before starting and never find out if the situation was truly impossible or challenge ourselves and our colleagues to keep moving forward
1812756 if you talk about dealing with uncertainty and dealing with a tough situation you cant think of a tougher situation than where people came in and put their life in peril by signing a document that was a breakthrough
1812757 they were people who were drawn from everyday walks of life and they rose to the occasion and did extraordinary things
1812758 i look around this company and i look at people who should be debilitated by whats happening around them who rise to the occasion and say i can deal with this
1812759 the japanese kid never knew there was anything other than 300 characters so he does it
1812760 on the contrary and i dont mean this in a demeaning sense we had very nice ordinary people but they did things that were extraordinary just because maybe they didnt know any better or the processes of the organization focused on getting them to do those things rather than doing other things
1812761 what separates a leader from a manager is the ability to inspire others to go beyond the limits that they and others may have set for them
1812762 ive often found that an apt quote helps get people moving when they get stuck
1812763 the one language all people understand is passion ive always been intensely passionate about my business and my people this has enabled me to work with people far more brilliant and capable than i and to get them to overcome their inner barriers
1812764 i never cease to be impressed by how our leaders constantly rise to deal with every situation we encounter im also amazed at how new challenges breed new leaders these are the leaders who will make the realization of a better tomorrow a reality for us
1812765 you have to find the right balance because youre human beings and you cant allow your life to drift too much to one side

1812777 the lack of financial skills and understanding is a critical problem for young people and their parents today there is a very little if any guidance on the secondary school level and the average high school graduate enters college with over 1 500 in credit card debt

1812779 our peoples liberation army pla soldiers are up to their necks in debt
1812780 they have been borrowing heavily to buy food after the government stopped paying them the monthly allowance it had promised theres no drinking water in the camps little electricity and acute shortage of medicine if the pla is not rehabilitated it is going to impact the peace process there wont be any restructuring of the state and there wont be any new constitution
1812781 we havent been paid the promised monthly salary of nrs 3000 us 45 for the last 13 months even the daily food allowance of nrs 60 less than one us dollar is grossly inadequate with the spiraling price rise there are 94 breast feeding mothers and minors in the camp and we cant get adequate nutrition for them
1812782 the maoists have shown themselves to be treacherous and untrustworthy
1812783 consequently we will not induct the pla into the nepal army they will have to be assimilated into other sectors
1812784 if the pla is not merged with the nepal army it will violate the peace pact and push the country to the brink of disaster
1812785 is the nc ready to take the blame for that disaster
1812786 the nepal army recruits soldiers in accordance with international norms
1812787 recruits have to meet the physical mental and psychological requirements of the army
1812788 if they try to get rid of the pla there will be resistance that may lead to civil war the pla will have no choice but to take up arms again

1812822 theres been an all or nothing at all view by those on the green side
1812823 what i havent bought into is this almost dictatorial concept that you must do it my way
1812824 let me just start by saying that it would not be unheard of for a republican candidate to win the youth vote
1812825 were going to talk about character and try to make that contrast with senator obama who many people think is a shaman and a mystic leader whos going to transform our politics when the most noticeable thing about him is that he voted 130 times present in the illinois legislature
1812826 obama is a man with a thin record and a man of few accomplishments who is running to be president of the united states against a genuine war hero and a man who actually put his political career on the line as recently as last year for his country
1812827 there are understandable reasons for people my age supporting senator obama to the degree they do
1812828 hes very eloquent and i think he appeals to young peoples general sense of optimism and ideals
1812829 if we can get young people to focus on his record closely
1812830 theyll see routinely he has worked for the prosperity of the us
1812831 the top thing i would say is how hes going to reform economic institutions to work for us
1812832 we need to convince young people that he has a plan to do this
1812833 they definitely havent reached out to the younger generation as strongly as i hoped they would
1812834 its a big mistake youve got to create something that people want to be a part of im just not getting that feeling this go round
1812835 republicans are sort of talking down to gen nexters not bringing them in
1812836 we view the youth vote as very competitive and we will campaign aggressively
1812837 i think its going to be very close and i think we need every vote we can get
1812838 if we can get that many more youth votes out for senator mccain and we can convince them he has the best politics for americas future prosperity then that could be decisive
1812839 we have to work every day every minute of the day to convince young americans that we offer the best policies for america for americas future and for them
1812840 as the olympic games come closer and closer china is continuing to use the games as a platform to legitimize their illegal occupation
1812841 the situation in tibet has not improved since china was awarded the olympics the situation in tibet has actually dramatically worsened
1812842 i think the olympics were politicized from the very beginning when the chinese government and the international olympic committee promised the world that human rights would improve inside china
1812843 all were doing is trying to tell the truth and use the olympic spotlight to shine it on the situation inside tibet
1812844 our job is to ensure that while individual rights are protected and respected we reach the most peaceful ending to any situation that were faced with
1812845 as canada prepares to host the 2010 winter olympics we must remind everyone that hosting the olympic games is not only a privilege it is a responsibility
1812846 the ioc and the host country have a responsibility to see that international human rights commitments are respected
1812847 based on the totality of the evidence we had gathered against him we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks

1812857 these storms depend on warm water as they move northward
1812858 if the waters are cool its like turning the thermostat down
1812859 more storms in the south likely will equate to more potential for storms in the north atlantic it is of concern obviously if people are raising their projections weve already had five tropical storms including the two hurricanes and the peak season doesnt really get going until mid august
1812860 if the weather pattern is unfavourable for hurricanes in our area which it certainly is now then the water could be 26 degrees here and it wouldnt make any difference
1812861 when a child can simply be handed from one legal guardian to another with little or no scrutiny of the new guardians background there is a problem here
1812862 child welfare has whats thought to be a pretty strict screening process
1812863 any time a child dies under these circumstances we as a community as a society have something to learn
1812864 theres no reason whatsoever why premier dalton mcguintys government couldnt proceed to learn as much as they can about how this little girl died because she fell between the cracks of a system that clearly has holes in it
1812865 they should get on with that investigation right now today not three hours not three weeks or three years from today
1812866 she had like the two black eyes she had a bruise on her nose scratches on to her face
1812867 she had a big bump here and a big one back there i mean you wouldnt do that to a dog

1812886 its an example of a number of computer systems in which the state made a large investment decades ago and has been keeping it going the last few years with duct tape

1812890 i also think that iraqi prime minister nouri al maliki recognizes that theyre going to need our help for some time to come as our commanders insist but that the help is of the sort that is consistent with the kind of phased withdrawal that i have promoted were going to have to provide them with logistical support intelligence support were going to have to have a very capable counterterrorism strike force were going to have to continue to train their army and police to make them more effective
1812891 would never seek in any way to compromise israels security

1812895 a dream is a dream but at the same time even i could not imagine that we would play together for omsk i think that such a thing as playing on a line together is possible anyway now i dream of scoring off a pass from jagr
1812896 jaromir knows that i have been invited there and once said you want to play in the nhl train more after these words i began to work even harder by the way after each practice jaromir works extra with me shows me all kinds of techniques teaches me how to shoot tells me how and on what i still need to work in a way he is one of my coaches
1812897 my contract with avangard still runs for one year so i did not think at all about a departure
1812898 and then when i learned that my idol would play in omsk i generally forgot about the nhl for awhile the arrival of jagr should give to us the young guys more confidence we will watch jagr and learn
1812899 for example cherepanov today he played simply superbly in any case i admire his game its obvious that alexei is an extremely skilled guy in practices he tries very hard and i think his efforts will bring results
1812900 thats something that we definitely think about it and envision
1812901 we actually see it in reality at the same time
1812902 probably the most exciting win ive been involved with here

1812905 wed like to dedicate this to tom brady your quarterback were big fans of his and very honored he came to the show and i hope to goodness it was worth it
1812906 patiently waiting for every album each has been better than the last
1812907 its a devastating injury for him its a devastating injury for us
1812908 he can be such a dominant force when hes healthy
1812909 he has been such a leader for us on and off the field and has had such a presence in the community as well
1812910 during the time he was injured last year as we went down the stretch he was with us and really made valuable contribution with our receivers

1812935 in truth in granting the faa the flexibility to design a personnel management system untethered to the pay and benefits requirements of title 5 congress intended to permit the faa the freedoms of a private sector employer but with those freedoms come the obligation to follow the flsas basic overtime pay requirements just as private sector employers must do
1812936 the court notes that overtime is standard in the private sector under the fair labor standards act
1812937 if as it appears congress sought to enable the faa to operate in a more businesslike manner analogous to the private sector abrogating the overtime provisions of the flsa does not appear consistent with that goal there is an absence in either the text of the legislation or in the legislative history of a clearly discernable indication of congressional intent to abrogate the protections of the flsa
1812938 were reviewing the decision and discussing our options with the department of justice
1812939 the courts decision that our members are due financial compensation is an affirmation that the faa cannot railroad everything past natca without any oversight or accountability of federal laws rules and regulations
1812940 this is a very important step in making our members whole again

1812944 i have been very fortunate twice in my career as a student of poetry
1812945 first to have been at reed college as an undergraduate with gary snyder philip whalen and lew welch second to have been in john berrymans extraordinary and intense poetry workshop with w d
1812946 i remember a day in the old tin barracks that served as our classroom down by the river when john berryman scribbled some lines of mine on the blackboard
1812947 it was that kind of blow torch approach that cut berrymans class in two weeks from about 40 to thirteen
1812948 i like to think of us now as the lucky thirteen but we were crazy too
1812949 phil levine punched berryman in the eye one night breaking a pair of glasses and establishing a life long friendship
1812950 the bad or perhaps i should say the tragic result of campus patronage in the u s is the depressing effect it sometimes has on major talents i think that the tragic and near suicidal deaths of randall jarrell theodore roethke and john berryman are not unconnected with their being in positions where although they were admired they were very isolated spender 286
1812951 he made a thousand years ago a many songs for an excellent lady wif whom he was in wuv shall he now publish them
1812952 so free them to the winds that play let boys amp girls with these old songs have holiday if they feel like it ix
1812953 is filled with accounts of friends deaths and suicides events which took their toll on berrymans psyche randall jarrell sylvia plath r p blackmur yvor winters william carlos williams and above all delmore schwartz to whose memory berryman dedicated the book and penned these personal losses were experienced during a time of great public loss as well john kennedy robert kennedy martin luther king ernest hemingway william faulkner yet none of these personal or public deaths figure so importantly in the volume as the suicide of berrymans father which is in one sense the sole subject of the latter collection 93
1812954 berryman is a poet so preoccupied with poetic effects as to be totally in their thrall
1812955 his inversions his personal and often irritatingly cute colloquialisms and deliberate misspellings his odd references his basing of lines and whole poems on private allusions create what must surely be the densest verbal thickets since the modernist english poet and critic william empsons dickey 198
1812956 these songs are not meant to be understood you understand they are only meant to terrify amp comfort
1812957 packed with private jokes topical and literary allusions berrymans reading and personal library are legendary they boggle many minds when the first were published robert lowell admitted
1812958 at first the brain aches and freezes at so much darkness disorder and oddness
1812959 the situation was considerably beclouded when four years later berryman dumped on the world a truckful of 308 additional as his career progressed unlike robert lowell and most other members of the school except for snodgrass berryman remained a formalist inventing for his work not only a poetic diction and a style of writing that is clearly recognizable as his own and no one elses but a specific poem form as well in

1812965 yes yes i do and i actually wrote an entire paragraph in what i wrote you but ended up deleting it because i could not define refine it enough

1812968 we are thrilled that this convention has prompted new and innovative programs among our official recycling providers waste management and coca cola
1812969 as part of our efforts to make this convention as eco friendly as possible we are working with them to keep a large portion of the recycled material right here in the state
1812970 the 2008 republican national convention has made it a priority to implement numerous conscientious environmentally friendly initiatives
1812971 we are pleased that coca cola and waste management have joined our efforts to be as environmentally friendly a convention as possible
1812972 waste management wanted to make it as easy as possible for people to recycle properly while attending the convention
1812973 by using co branded containers waste management and coca cola have made it simple for convention attendees to do their part for the environment
1812974 by creating opportunities to easily recycle coca cola recycling can help to ensure that we capture the packaging for all of the beverages consumed at the 2008 republican national convention
1812975 our expertise will not only allow us to provide the infrastructure to divert most of the materials collected at the xcel energy center and saint paul rivercentre from local landfills but the recycling bins energy efficient coolers and hybrid electric trucks that cce will use throughout the venues will stay in minnesota providing a sustainable and long term solution to help keep minneapolis saint paul green long after the convention is finished

1812992 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
1812993 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent it s like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1812994 cash flow from operations is superior to any deal we can get from the usual suspects
1812995 its kind of ironic that zillow is the one talking about homeowners optimism since they have historically overvalued homes although they have gotten a little better recently
1812996 zillows estimates have been found to be wrong by measurable amounts so the homeowners could be correct and zillows estimates could be off
1812997 prices are falling steeply in neighborhoods with large exposure to subprime loans while neighborhoods with very little subprime loan exposure are doing fine
1812998 their home values may be better now than two years ago so they see much of the current data as short term statistical noise

1813000 the answer is yes they see and notice racial differences from a very young age even in infancy
1813001 for children under the age of seven race or rather physical traits like skin color language and hair texture are just signs that someone is in some way different from themselves similar to gender or weight its not unusual or unhealthy for kids to gravitate toward the familiar so early in life kids views only become prejudiced when they start linking these physical traits to flaws in character or behavior we adults are the ones who ascribe malice to simply noticing racial differences
1813002 they assume that if they raise their children not to recognize racial differences theyll prevent them from becoming racist
1813003 instead of trying to ignore race research suggests that parents should be more pro active
1813004 well it looks like a lot of black kids like playing basketball do you want to play basketball with them when youre older
1813005 this certainly puts a big dent into our requirements for this region and for nova scotia
1813006 if you are trying to measure your ad campaign in clicks you are completely missing the impact
1813007 people are beginning to understand how these online ad exposures do have a brand building impact and as they begin to see the value in that and get out of the mindset its all about direct response and purchasing something online right now more dollars will begin to shift online
1813008 a much larger share of the paid search ad market
1813009 we question whether such collection and use of personal data is necessary for advertising purposes whether subscribers have consented to such uses of their personal data and whether the practice is appropriate in the circumstances
1813010 in theory they could know everything you would see on your screen
1813011 at least without some fairly clear consent on the part of the users
1813012 if we make those eyeballs less trusting they wont come to your site and then they cant be reached by advertisers
1813013 that positions us as the eighth most visited online destination in canada
1813014 were looking at 214 million in internet revenue annualized by 2010 online should reach about 20 per cent of our revenues its a growing category
1813015 you have to honor the price in effect at the time you made a written contract
1813016 we just couldnt possibly top off everybody who asks us
1813017 they told me they were not going to do it because they would be losing money filling me up
1813018 if youre under contract youre under contract auto delivery means just that
1813019 it opens up a lot of information about keywords and markets that was previously unavailable or only available through paid tools this coupled with the real data being provided in googles keyword tool and trends data is pushing into the paid keyword tool market they could make them obsolete eventually
1813020 we arent going to just be able to cruise in and take customers from them
1813021 you are going to be able to text and we arent going to be tracking and saying oh you know what you had 500 text messages oh you had 501 text messages
1813022 theres nothing like that its always part of a wireless service why should it not be included
1813023 i think theres perhaps a notion thats floating out there post spectrum that any number of new players can just enter the market and pick up and acquire new customers
1813024 its much more difficult to deliver that value over the long term of a contract or on a month to month basis to customers who have experienced fairly sophisticated service over the last few years
1813025 thats really where we are positioned if you are looking for the cheapest price we dont attract that kind of customer
1813026 that s where the reflection is for the left it s that we need to be able to articulate ourselves in this process of change that does not belong to mas but rather to all of us
1813027 the government treats everyone who are against it like oligarchy if you are masista you have to subjugate to the government but if we are not masistas we are completely maltreated and discriminated those are the causes of the current fight and the division among bolivians

1813052 when i compare our high schools to what i see when im traveling abroad i am terrified for our work force of tomorrow in math and science our fourth graders are among the top students in the world by eighth grade theyre in the middle of the pack by 12th grade u s students are scoring near the bottom of all industrialized nations the percentage of a population with a college degree is important but so are sheer numbers in 2001 india graduated almost a million more students from college than the united states did china graduates twice as many students with bachelors degrees as the u s and they have six times as many graduates majoring in engineering in the international competition to have the biggest and best supply of knowledge workers america is falling behind

1813056 companies take their profits with them and we are left to deal with the impacts on our people communities and public health
1813057 families pay more than ever at a time when colorado companies are drilling more than ever
1813058 drilling is part of the solution but not all of it and we need to make sure that drilling is done in a safe responsible way
1813059 financials bounced back because the second quarter wasnt as bad as feared
1813060 i still think youre going to see massive volatility in the sector
1813061 people will review the second quarter earnings season and see nearly every bank with deteriorating credit conditions despite banks and lenders managements saying were not going to be raising capital i think the equity market is going to be somewhat sceptical of that perspective when credit losses continue to rise
1813062 clearly what were seeing is the unwinding of a lot of enthusiasm
1813063 i would not be surprised to see oil keep on falling and maybe it will overshoot i still think oil will persist above 100 bucks could we see it shoot down to us90 in the short term very possible is it going to us50 i dont think so
1813064 we are confident that we can try cases to the highest standards of justice
1813065 it is a surprising result in a globalising world with increasingly mobile capital flows for a small open economy to have the highest weight given to the taxation of capital income
1813066 i dont necessarily find thateverything in this paper gels with everything that i have said on tax in the past and that is as it should be
1813067 but you will hurt everyone who has put savings into superannuation and all those small businesses that are accumulating franking credits
1813068 the alternative for the government is do the unpopular thing of shift the tax burden to the community and lower the tax rate on the corporate sector
1813069 dont stand too close to each other or you wont have room to wave your flags
1813070 specifically the australian tax authorities are investigating whether hogan evaded the payment of taxes
1813071 the australian tax authorities have reason to believe that hogan may have failed to properly report all taxable items on some or all the australian income tax returns that he filed for the years 2000 to 2007
1813072 are at the core of the australian tax investigation and are not appropriate for resolution by a us court
1813073 hogan simply misunderstands the nature of summons enforcement proceedings and completely ignores the supreme courts ruling on treaty request summonses
1813074 need only make a minimal showing that the summons was issued in good faith
1813075 probably only using 30 or 40 of the power of the ps3 right now

1813085 it is our belief that net 3 5 in general and silverlight in particular will change programming more significantly than anything that has come from microsoft for a least a decade
1813086 promoters and participants in aggressive tax shelters should know that the irs will remain vigilant
1813087 i think if theres any problem the government has when i say a problem i dont think its a problem necessarily it is to not have an overarching narrative in place

1813096 we hope that everyone will understand and support this decision as it is the only right one for the circumstances we want to deliver a full production and a killer live experience when we finally come to south america and not some amputated half assed shows it is a known fact that it takes a considerable amount of time to organize such a tour in south america as opposed to europe not to mention finding the right promoters our main priority now is to set our minds 100 into making this album as astonishing as it has to be and therefore we see no other alternative than to postpone the tour please note that we are using the word postpone here we will reach your shores after the new album is released to give you a show that you as well as the band deserves
1813097 agri processors categorically denies the suggestion that it knowingly hired or retained minors as employees and it protests the issuance of a press release that has patently been motivated by a desire to ride the crest of the wave of current public opinion adverse to agri processors
1813098 notwithstanding the leisurely pace of its investigation the inability of even the governments expert to identify any employees in the plant as minors and the refusal to disclose the identities of any employees who the labor commissioner believed to be employed in violation of child labor laws the commissioner has now issued an inflammatory press release alleging that there were 57 cases and egregious violations

1813124 les politiciens se sont arrog s le droit de parler au nom de tous les habitants
1813125 pourquoi les loi conomiques seraient elles plus importantes que les lois sociales

1813130 yvon fleurent a crit 1 ao t 2008 2 49 peut tre parce que les loi conomique sont comme kevin oui m carl des peut tre des si des hypoth ses des principes des conceptions et des affirmations qui nont jamais exist ou qui nont jamais fait leurs preuves par contre le socialisme lui qui na rien voir avec le marxisme et dans lequel est inclus le capitalisme fait ses preuves en am rique en europe et merge en chine en russie et en inde en fait partout enfin pour ceux qui peuvent comprendre les libertariens cest exactement comme le maxiste et les ra liens ra l fait de largent mais pas les ra liens le socialisme na pas t crit il est inn chez l tre humain comme chez les chiens et les l phants qui sont de bons compagnons pour lhumain mais ils ont de beaux r ves dont la propagande profite plusieurs fortun s en capital
1813131 le socialisme na pas t crit il est inn chez l tre humain comme chez les chiens et les l phants qui sont de bons compagnons pour lhumain
1813132 videmment on a pu voir le public s mouvoir dun tel comportement chez les d taillants dessence et r clamer plus de vigilance de la part du gouvernement ainsi que des p nalit s exemplaires pour les coupables raison car la concurrence est essentielle au bon fonctionnement du march
1813133 et il y a toujours le danger de se faire prendre la main dans le sac
1813134 encore faut il que les amendes soient dissuasives on pourrait galement y ajouter des peines de prison car il sagit bel et bien de cas de fraude et de vol conomiques
1813135 hmm d sol mais malgr que lon soit en 2008 avec des contr les gouvernementaux conomique du plus en plus pr sent je crois que dans une bussiness priv e ont a encore le choix de vendre aux prix que lon veut
1813136 ce quon na pas le droit de faire et qui est contre la concurrence cest de sallier en cartel pour fixer les prix et ainsi cr er un quivalent doligopole qui maintient les prix lev s inutilement et abat la concurrence qui se veut loyale pour maintenir son h g monie ill gale

1813141 sil fallait consulter tout le monde 100 de la population
1813142 explique nous la d finition de retomb e conomique dans ce cas tu sais que quand je vais acheter un sandwitch au d paneur je fais des retomb es conomiques autant que quand je me fais couper les cheveux ou acheter une 24
1813143 un b mol peut tre appropri dans le cas d v nements qui attirent des touristes car il y a effectivement injection de nouveaux fonds et certaines retomb es sont consid rer
1813144 supposons que l levage des enfants bin oui comme des vaches tait la responsabilit du gouvernement
1813145 maintenant jaimerais que tu mexpliques pourquoi sans gouvernement il ny a pas dinvestissement possible
1813146 pour un d fenseur de lanarchie qui fait la moral tout le monde sous dautres billets tu es m lang pas mal dans tes chim res
1813147 quoi je pr f re que mes imp ts payent un tel inoubliable spectacle que plut t pour payer des politiciens couchons qui font rien pour le bonheur et le bien tre des personnes je vais couter quelquun qui est part de lhistoire
1813148 par contre le fait quun v nement attire une client le qui quitte un autre nest pas mauvaise en soi quun concurrent se retrouve avec la client le dun autre moins efficace je nai absolument rien contre le perdant se r orientera dans une discipline o il excelle
1813149 ce que larticle devrait d noncer cest que les subventions ne cr ent pas de richesse elles la d place il tait temps quon le d nonce mais je trouve a mal fait en fait a ressemble plus un texte pleurnichard sur la situation des autres festivals jaurais aim quil d montre tr s simplement parce que cest tellement simple comprendre que l tat fait les choix la place des citoyens parce quil serait omniscient
1813150 vos employ s municipaux sont l pour vous le priv lui est l pour qui
1813151 en effet la strat gie de gestion de crise qui vise ins rer la t te vers un autre orifice corporel est assez efficiente

1813154 on devrait interdire la cigarette sur tout le territoire qu b cois si on peut sauver ne serait ce quune seule vie le jeu en aura valu la chandelle
1813155 nationaliser le p trole pour payer ses dettes et placer de largent pour le futur
1813156 je ne comprend pas pourquoi le libertarianisme peut il d ranger autant les gens comme ce type
1813157 cest impossible que les gens soit suffisamment charitable pour remplacer le gouvernement
1813158 le capitalisme m ne lextr me de pauvret et seulement une lite se retrouve en haut en poss dant tout il ny aurait alors que des patrons et des esclaves

1813160 and i sincerely believe with you that banking establishments are more dangerous than a standing armies and that the principle of spending money to be paid by the posterity under the name of funding is but swindling futurity on a large scale
1813161 i am not among those who fear the people they and not the rich are our dependence for continued freedom and to preserve their independence we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual dept
1813162 par ailleurs cest pas mal le qu bec et lontario qui ont finnanc le d veloppement de lindustrie albertaine
1813163 en passant je suis pas mal sur que la russie est un pays europ en
1813164 fasse des milliards de dollars en exploitant une ressource qui en principe tappartient plus qu lui
1813165 on peut pas avoir un march libre regardez la russie comment elle va mal elle se fait piller par le capitalisme sauvage depuis la chute du communisme
1813166 regardez comme la russie va bien aujourdhui cest parce ya un monopole sur lindustrie p troli re
1813167 je r p te comment un tel scandale aurait pu se produire sans lintervention de l tat
1813168 dans un monde ou r gne lanarchie il ny aurais plus de fraude ni de corruption
1813169 lorsquun enfant est victime dabus on prend son gun et on fou une balle dans la t te a lagresseur si un citoyen viole ma propri t je lui passe dessus avec ma voiture pour r gler le probl me non il y a une justice et jusqu pr sent elle est a mes yeux efficace il na rien de parfait
1813170 il y a toujours des groupes qui vont se former librement et chercher dominer les autres les petites se feront craser il y aura des scandales de lexploitation et des passes droits souvent sans la moindre impunit
1813171 sans m me un tat de droit cela a d j exist dans le pass et les r sultats ont t catastrophiques en ce moment il y a la darfour ou il nexiste pratiquement aucun etat et regarder le paysage

1813173 jusqu preuve du contraire la justice m me imparfaite prot ge les citoyens contre les abus physique et psychologique elle permet a une personne disposant de peu de moyen de voir certains de ses droits respecter
1813174 je parle ici du r le des agences de surveillance des aliments et dinspections
1813175 si les services dun tat sont des besoins essentiels et universels si les loi nous prot geaient si la s curit monopolis e tait une bonne chose pourquoi garder des gouvernements de pays et de province

1813184 un handicap la raison pour laquelle nous ne pouvons pas faire rayonner notre agriculture comme les autres grands pays cest que nous avons un handicap le climat nous ne serons jamais concurrentiels ouvrir toutes grandes nos fronti res serait l quivalent de rayer des pans entiers de notre agriculture de la carte ce qui aurait des effets catastrophiques en termes doccupation du territoire tout a pour baisser le prix de lait de 3 cents le litre il faut cesser de comparer la nourriture nimporte quel objet industriel le courant de lavenir est celui des achats de proximit de la dispersion des lieux de production sur tous les territoires on ne peut pas risquer de p nuries alimentaires
1813185 no way moi je ne mange rien qui ne provienne dun animal

1813193 its incredibly hard to solve because theres so many licence holders involved youve got the guys that own the license to the gaming rights now the guys that have the licence to bond as an ip and there are umpteen licensees

1813195 our list is not for retirement age workers who still have their nose to their primary occupation grindstone according to robert skladany vice president of research and services at retirementjobs com
1813196 those workers often have to go where the jobs are in their industry or profession regardless of the location
1813197 additionally we plan to further focus our resources in the second half to improve gross margins and operating efficiencies
1813198 the world cannot grow its way out of this slowdown
1813199 huge spike in global commodity price inflation is prima facie evidence that the global economy is still growing too fast
1813200 dollar bloc countries have slavishly mimicked expansionary u s monetary policy
1813201 absent a significant global recession it will probably take a couple of years of sub trend growth to rebalance commodity supply and demand
1813202 there was an alan horn conversation where he said his vision and spikes vision werent on the same page
1813203 we support spikes vision were helping him make the vision he wants to make
1813204 spike wanted to do things low tech he wanted big animatronic wild things in the jungle which look great as you go deeper in the jungle and weather sets in we misjudged that production wise
1813205 spike wont talk down to kids hes got a kids soul
1813206 its good to see the market holding onto yesterdays gains cisco is probably responsible for much of the nasdaqs move
1813207 the fundamentals in these commodity related stocks are still pretty good it could be bargain hunting maybe its also a little more belief that the economic growth story is not completely over
1813208 i dont see much light at the end of the tunnel
1813209 i still think there will be more problems not only with fannie and freddie but also with a number of banks
1813210 i think were getting into better territory ive been very much focused on the fall in oil prices as a necessary ingredient to avoid recession to the extent that were getting that thats just great
1813211 what we need in this market is for the financial stocks to stabilize i think theyll stabilize well before the housing market fixes itself
1813212 this commodity pullback is very timely because i think it does take that stress point away from the market
1813213 grandparents probably dont speak to grandchildren using messenger yet those are very strong communication links
1813214 it would take a lot of effort to go back and grab more data
1813215 any random sampling will destroy the structure of the network

1813230 not only is custom design prohibitively expensive for all but the most successful bloggers but also the odds of any designer developer nailing a functional flexible easy to modify codebase from scratch on the first iteration are a zillion to one

1813232 if i go to a website and i see that it looks almost exactly the same in design layout as another site ive previously been to and i see ads on that site ive already moved on to another site i am a firm believer in custom design if you want to stand out amongst your competition peers then you need originality not a theme

1813236 we go to tons of tech social events its hard to make a connection let alone separate the schmoozers from the geniuses corporate espionage is a test of smarts and strategy the most dynamic marketing guy and geeked out developer can get trumped by a recruiter who understands how to build a team and work with stock options its just a deck of cards but it tells you a lot about who you might want to do business with

1813239 i dont think it has ever been easy but i think nowadays you have to be able to drive to a higher standard
1813240 quite a lot of learners want to pass as quickly and as cheaply as possible which is not always the safest way
1813241 if people are not happy with the standard of their driving then they should take up further training such as the pass plus test
1813242 the pass rate is quite low so if we made it harder then less would pass
1813243 i think people need to be more aware of road safety
1813244 i wouldnt say that passing your driving test is easy but it is easy when you put the work in
1813245 i dont think that they should change the theory or practical part of the driving test

1813249 using iphone to read feeds means i get that when i sit down i already have all my information and all i have to do is post
1813250 right now mainly using my iphone for keeping up on my email and feeds and doing some live blogging but hard w o c amp p
1813251 the thought of having to write 1000 words on an iphone is enough to make me want to curl up in the fetal position and start crying
1813252 that made me laugh sadly its the situation for just about any hand held device and even harder on my n95
1813253 i could definitely see the iphone as replacing my moleskine notebook as a tool for capturing ideas

1813257 consumers who would like to be able to buy local fruits and vegetables not just at farmers markets but also in the produce aisle of their supermarket will be dismayed to learn that the federal government works deliberately and forcefully to prevent the local food movement from expanding and the barriers that the united states department of agriculture has put in place will be extended when the farm bill that house and senate negotiators are working on now goes into effect

1813283 sungguh suatu pengalaman menyenangkan dapat memberikan tambahan ilmu kepada anak anak yang sangat antusias mengetahui lebih jauh profesi polisi
1813284 sebuah drama akan ditampilkan dalam kota mini ini yang akan membantu anak untuk lebih mengerti

1813307 ada satu dua parpol yang benar benar baru seperti partai indonesia sejahtera pis dan partai matahari bangsa pmb
1813308 selebihnya diisi oleh pemain lama yang telah diketahui jejak rekam dan prestasinya
1813309 sulit memetakan ideologi parpol baru karena dari yang ada mayoritas masih mengusung ideologi nasionalis sekuler dan inklusif
1813310 akan lain skenarionya jika parpol baru menghadirkan gagasan baru dan kandidat baru dalam kepemimpinan nasional ini akan punya prospek perubahan
1813311 makanya kita menerapkan sistem parliamentary threshold batas ambang keterwakilan parlemen red untuk merekayasa perampingan parpol
1813312 itu adalah gambaran bahwa gagasan perampingan partai tidak berhasil saya takutkan partai baru yang ada tidak bisa mengkoordinasikan aspirasi masyarakat dengan baik
1813313 kan parpol baru itu banyak yang pecahan dari partai sebelumnya dan ini menunjukkan politik masih dipersepsi untuk penuhi kebutuhan kepentingan
1813314 ya kita hargai saja proses demokrasi yang ada tapi nanti secara alamiah akan tersaring kan legitimasi perolehan suara harus dilihat
1813315 dengan penyederhanaan partai ini kan kita juga berharap sistem pemerintahan juga akan lebih baik

1813526 miss buffalo chip isnt a beauty contest in the traditional sense its a relatively debauched topless and sometimes bottomless multiday contest where women dance jiggle and reportedly even perform blow jobs on bananas for the titillation of the spectators and john mccain offered up his 54 year old wife as a contestant he did it to pander to the crowds idea of appropriate masculinity and that apparently includes over sexualizing your wife and the mother of your children for the amusement of a few people in a crowd mccain offered up the thought of his wife objectifying herself for the sexual gratification of others at his suggestion in order to get a couple of chuckles inspire some male fantasy and make a few friends fun i think its another piece of gravel in a growing mountain of evidence that john mccain doesnt think a lot about women their place as equals in society or their rights in that society but he does seem to think a lot about us as sexual beings or at least sexual objects

1813532 its an initiative to prevent the worst abuse of farm animals in the food industry in the state it seems to me that chaining veal calves by the neck and forcing pigs as intelligent and as emotionally evolved as dogs into crates that prevent them from even turning around are practices that truly need to end

1813536 obama is shallow hes an empty suit he doesnt have the relevant experience to work the country out of its problems and john mccain does ive been advocating an action policy to solve these problems and thats resonating with voters thats why ill say mccain is going to carry massachusetts and im going to beat john kerry

1813542 as the olympic games come closer and closer china is continuing to use the games as a platform to legitimize their olympic occupation
1813543 the situation in tibet has not improved since china was awarded the olympics the situation in tibet has actually dramatically worsened
1813544 i think the olympics were politicized from the very beginning when the chinese government and the international olympic committee promised the world that human rights would improve inside china
1813545 all were doing is trying to tell the truth and use the olympic spotlight to shine it on the situation inside tibet
1813546 our job is to ensure that while individual rights are protected and respected we reach the most peaceful ending to any situation that were faced with
1813547 we have always been open to having a meeting with the embassy
1813548 as canada prepares to host the 2010 winter olympics we must remind everyone that hosting the olympic games is not only a privilege it is a responsibility
1813549 the ioc and the host country have a responsibility to see that international human rights commitments are respected

1813564 a lot of times transwomen specifically transwomen of color are targeted for multiple reasons regarding various identities transgender identity being one of them a hate crime like this serves to intimidate and disrupt an entire community no one should ever live their lives in fear and intimidation regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity

1813568 when you read through the books there is no mention of islam allah or the koran
1813569 i used an islamic archetype but the actual stories dont show any islam because they are based on values that we all share
1813570 are based on religious archetypes like the prophets from the bible they are all orphans superman left his parents on the planet krypton and batman sees his father and mother gunned down in front of him
1813571 the goal is to teach children that there are 99 ways to solve a problem
1813572 in the eighth issue jabbar the powerful must rely on nooras ability to see the light of truth in others to annihilate the bad guys
1813573 even though there are approximately 50 female superheroes only five will be covered in that way
1813574 i want to send the message out that there is not only one way to be muslim
1813575 when you hear these stories of saddam hussein who was cast as a hero and then ended up torturing his own people you ask yourself what kind of message we are sending our kids about what a hero does
1813576 with the 99 i wanted to make a difference and give muslim kids positive role models
1813577 we believe aafia has been in custody ever since she disappeared
1813578 and were not willing to believe that the discovery of aafia in afghanistan is coincidence

1813580 im not afraid the truth is its pretty safe here its not like this sort of thing happens every day
1813581 starting from last year the east turkestan forces at home and abroad tried sabotage and violent activities targeting the beijing games
1813582 the east turkestan islamic movement and the east turkestan liberation organization are the two most active ones
1813583 the beijing games are our one last golden opportunity to inflict such attacks on china even though we know we are weak like an egg on a stone they will try to smear the stone
1813584 kashgar people of all ethnic groups are a strong foundation to combat east turkestan forces
1813585 we have a unitary ethnic environment and a very stable society

1813603 it sounds like paris hilton supports john mccains all of the above approach to americas energy crisis including both alternatives and drilling paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan

1813612 first sigma rho members brought a dead body to a hospital and all autopsies point to grave physical punishment as the cause of death on that point alone the frat is caught red handed as the culprit on the other hand the gma administration came up with a deal involving zte and all scrutinies point to the deals inability to comply with the laws standard operating procedures on government transactions
1813613 hindi ko alam na naaprove pala yan ng opisina ko
1813614 hindi sa malacanang nanggaling yan province of tarlac ang nag approve ng deal na yan
1813615 the sigma rho case has a lot of circumstantial evidence saying that the dead neophyte was a recruit of a sigma rhoan who was a popular college student leader in up and that the neophyte contacted his friends about a scheduled initiation rites with the frat on the other hand the existence of the zte deal itself is enough evidence to point that malacanang was its source then came lozada and company to prove what is already obvious
1813616 third in both cases the accused chose to shut up and ignored public outrage they did not participate in hearings and investigations snubbed sub poenas employed technicalities to avoid the issue
1813617 why should you care after all its peoples money which is the very attitude of those in power its still taxpayers money to think that it is perpetuated through a loan than would only burden us more
1813618 this is why our politicians get to make damage control here and there for their slip ups

1813630 here we are 45 years after the i have a dream speech forty years after the assassinations of kennedy and king and this party that i have been a part of for so long this party that has been accused of taking black people for granted is about to deliver the nomination for the nations highest office to an african american how do you describe that all those days in jail cells wondering if anything you were doing was even going to have an impact
1813631 but ive got a head too and in the beginning my head was with clinton the conventional wisdom was that this thing was going to be over in february
1813632 youd be real embarrassed if he won and you wasnt down with it
1813633 conversations like those i had with clyburn and lewis however begin to illuminate just how emotionally complicated such internal deliberations were
1813634 if anybody tells you they expected this result theyre not being honest with you
1813635 of course i would support someone i knew and had liked and had worked with versus someone id never heard of
1813636 every kid is always talking about what his parents have been through
1813637 and no kid has any clue what hes talking about
1813638 but now i realize had i been given the opportunity what i could have been and im about to die
1813639 the people i work with are the new black politics we dont carry around that history we see the world through post civil rights eyes i dont mean that disrespectfully but thats just the way it is
1813640 i dont want in any way to seem critical of the generation of leadership who fought so i could be sitting here
1813641 barack obama is the sum of their struggle hes the sum of their tears their fights their marching their pain this opportunity is the sum of that
1813642 but its like watching something that youve been working on all your life sort of come together right before your eyes and you cant see it
1813643 its like youve been building the great wall of china and you finally put that last stone in and you cant see it you just cant see the enormity of it
1813644 he should keep hope alive and any personal attacks and insults to himself
1813645 but youve got to learn one basic lesson youre trying to start at the top and you cant start at the top in politics
1813646 i dont think a group with 435 members can be the top of anything
1813647 race was a factor in the contest between obama and clinton
1813648 theres no question race will be a factor with obama and mccain but im not sure it plays out as neatly as people think theres no question that some young cohort of white voters were drawn to obama because they like the idea of a break with the past a young white politician from illinois might not have gotten that support so race probably cost obama some votes and it probably won him some votes thats the complex reality were living in
1813649 you know what its like growing up every single day and having people ask to touch your hair because theyve never seen hair like that
1813650 to have the entire class laugh and giggle when somebody pronounces niger as nigger the constant bombardment of that kind of thing really affects your spirit and its every single day like when people want to come back from a vacation and compare their tan to yours and joke about being black
1813651 i dont want people to expect me to speak about those issues
1813652 i want people to ask me about nonproliferation i want them to run to me to speak about the situation in the middle east
1813653 i dont want to be the person thats turned to when cnn talks about black leaders
1813654 so obamas the first one out there on the ice
1813655 this campaign is giving other african americans like myself the courage to be themselves
1813656 there was an arrogance and a complete dismissiveness in our campaign against obama that he was a lightweight that he couldnt get black support
1813657 a lot of the black leaders didnt know him didnt think he was black enough didnt think he was of the civil rights movement
1813658 internal polling in both campaigns after iowa showed obama suddenly garnering closer to 75 or 80 percent of the black vote in primary states
1813659 i grew up in the south where men like barack obama who right now is older than bill clinton was when he ran for president were called boy
1813660 there was something about the condescension on his face when he said it and the dismissiveness in his voice
1813661 the memories of humiliation and doubt and fear have not gone away nor has the anger and bitterness of those years at times that anger is exploited by politicians to gin up votes along racial lines or to make up for a politicians own failings
1813662 in the context of what i do for a living ive not figured out a black or white way to fill a pothole
1813663 i think there was a lot of sensitivity some warranted and some unwarranted
1813664 its based on your life experience and its generational you know if you have a sore on your arm you dont necessarily have to touch the sore to feel the pain you can touch another part of your arm youve still got a certain sensitivity to it so if race is the sensitive thing then anything that even gets close to it sounds like it looks like it feels like it is it
1813665 you guys told me it was a skin condition i thought i was talking to a brother
1813666 look i never asked anybody to be for me because i was black
1813667 i asked people to be for me because i thought i was the best candidate when i ran for city council and when i ran for mayor im proud of the votes i received im proud i received the votes of the majority of the african american community and the majority of the vote from the white community but i never asked anybody to give me anything because i was black i asked people to give me a chance because i thought i was the best
1813668 its presumptuous it demonstrates a continuation of this notion that the african american community unlike any other is completely monolithic that everyone in the african american community does the same thing in lockstep in contrast to any other group i mean i dont remember seeing john kerry on tv and anybody saying to him i cant believe youre not for hillary clinton why
1813669 the challenge there is never forgetting where you came from
1813670 so yes i am mayor of all philadelphia but i am quite well aware of and raise on a regular basis the fact that the majority of people who are killed in philadelphia are african american that the overwhelming majority of people who have health care challenges are african american that education has tremendous disparity gaps unemployment incarceration poverty homelessness housing all affect the african american community at a disproportionate level as opposed to everyone else
1813671 this isnt a struggle that began in the 1930s or 1960s its a struggle that began in 1620 its a struggle against slavery and its children
1813672 one of the things i talk to clients about is that the digital divide has changed
1813673 its no longer along racial lines like it was in 1996 and 2000 now its more economic and educational
1813674 things are changing from where they were 30 years ago the fights are changing and you have an infrastructure thats not producing results look at the incarceration rates the difference between whites and blacks what are the old organizations accomplishing
1813675 there are some members who need to go or to update and be accountable
1813676 its not about getting rid of the n a a c p or our members of congress its just wanting to be proud of our leaders
1813677 shes poised to be one of the most influential people in politics and particularly among african americans in politics
1813678 even as we continue to defend affirmative action as a useful if limited tool to expand opportunity to underrepresented minorities we should consider spending a lot more of our political capital convincing america to make investments needed to ensure that all children perform at grade level and graduate from high school a goal that if met would do more than affirmative action to help those black and latino children who need it the most
1813679 if obama is president it will no longer be tenable to go to the white community and say youve been victimized
1813680 and i understand the poverty and the condition of black america and the 39 percent unemployment rate in some communities i understand that but if you go out to the country and say youve been victimized by the white community while barack obama and michelle and their kids are living in the white house you will be shut off from having any influence
1813681 its a very interesting question but as a black person you should feel confident that he will focus on your injustices and know that all the other injustices in other communities affect you too
1813682 there have been wounds in all the communities not just in the black community there are plenty of wounds to go around
1813683 youre constantly tested by a whole host of factors to see whether youre speaking for the entire commonwealth or just for one community
1813684 i dont fit in any box and i think thats what the electorate has had to learn about me
1813685 yes but its not good enough for me to have the reaction that you just did to say im the governor not the mayor
1813686 you wouldnt believe how many times in the last few days people have stuck microphones in my face to ask my opinion about jesse jacksons comments
1813687 all i have to be is as good a human being and as good a governor as i can be and the rest will take care of itself
1813688 we may have to think about how to spend hiv prevention dollars if these trials are as effective as we all think they should be
1813689 our study suggests that compounds such as sulforaphane from broccoli may help counter processes linked to the development of vascular disease in diabetes
1813690 in future it will be important to test if eating a diet rich in brassica vegetables such as broccoli has health benefits for diabetic patients we expect that it will

1813705 were hoping to lower the barrier to participation by providing a forum for surfacing sharing and collaborating on new ideas and concepts our goal is to bring even more people to the table and provoke thought facilitate discussion and inspire future design directions for firefox the mozilla project and the web as a whole
1813706 as with most mozilla projects were developing the concept in the open and hope to see the idea and process evolve with the wider participation of the global community of collaborators if the early response is indication well certainly have more to share over the coming weeks and months
1813707 a sentence paragraph or even bullet points to kick start the process ideas can be simple and non technical it should be easy for anyone and everyone to help shape the future of the web so throw your notions inspirations dreams and visions out to the community
1813708 they are in a new environment they are discriminated against they are living in harsh conditions sometimes just in boxes covered in plastic near the farms where they work
1813709 when people live that way they engage in high risk behavior
1813710 its about decisions it was a pretty well placed ball where i was forced to make a decision come or go i came and she beat me to it
1813711 norway are great competitors and we have a lot of respect for them
1813712 it was just unfortunate that they got two early goals on us our team bounced back and there were some good moments we just have to take the positives and lucky for us it was the first game
1813713 this was a crazy game with us giving up two goals at the beginning of the game but then we bounced back
1813714 in the second half we made some tactical changes tried three in the back and tried certain things the effort of the players is the reason we will be successful and we still have a chance to win a gold medal
1813715 i am stepping down from the volunteer role i recently agreed to take on with the obama campaign as arab american and muslim american coordinator in order to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change
1813716 we need muslim americans to get excited about the campaign and theres a lot to get excited about
1813717 and of course there are added sensitivities with our faith given the
1813718 the look of the course is pretty much the same its obviously a lot tougher than it was at the ryder cup
1813719 obviously the rough is thicker they have added some good length bunkers are a little bit deeper
1813720 i had had a bit more to drink than ive had right now although i think we all were sort of pretty well on our way
1813721 its not the way my mind was working i was just kind of focusing on this week and not what happened in the past on the golf course
1813722 only probably on the 18th green where i stopped sort of preparing for this weeks tournament and i just said to my caddie do you remember that putt that sergio holed there it was only because he nearly hit me with the putter when he tossed it up in the air thats the only reason i remember that
1813723 if they dont its their own damned fault for not having it because they really took it to us
1813724 i played last july in the british open qualifier here and the golf course is right in front of you the greens are difficult but they are still right in front of you i remember them all
1813725 its not rocket science its just youve got to be under these holes you cannot play them from over the greens theres no tricks obviously just a lot of long clubs for me and i enjoy hitting them
1813726 walking to dinner last night one guy stopped the car on the street sent his son over i signed the autograph and he got back in the car
1813727 it was kind of freaky actually it was fine there wasnt much going on it wasnt a busy street

1813795 you want to play your best and put your best foot forward in these two preseason games or three however many i dont know yet when the final verdict comes in

1813803 and hes a natural leader but hes got to show people in the community that this isnt talk
1813804 its in the past and all i can do is worry about now i cant worry about yesterday
1813805 im just going to do everything im supposed to do whether its off the field or on the field and get past this he said
1813806 its just being the best player i can be in the community and on the field
1813807 and like i said i have a job to do and i plan on getting it done
1813808 any time you lose a guy like brandon for a couple of games its going to hurt cutler said

1813824 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment in his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a non story

1813874 what we want to have happen is for senator obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
1813875 the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated
1813876 obama knew exactly what he was doing he knew chicago reporters would not spend the night nor would the crowd he didnt want cameras around to sympathize with the willises and badger him about the demise of choose life at his hand he was right not many were present on march 13 2003 when obama and the democrat controlled committee voted to kill choose life obamas fanatical support of abortion extends not only to opposing legislation to save abortion survivors but also to opposing legislation to help mothers and families in need cover adoption expenses and obama will roll over anyone standing in the way

1813880 five years ago there were lots and lots of people whod never heard of a churro and many of the people who did know what one was had had one at disneyland or at a ballpark
1813881 ill tip my hat to them they familiarized the american people with churros and gave people that first wonderful experience
1813882 theyre sold in the mornings by women who carry large flat baskets on their heads
1813883 these churros are made at home and brought into the market to sell still hot and covered with granulated sugar
1813884 the menu is churros and four kinds of hot chocolate and thats it
1813885 i am so wild about churros theyre one of my favorite things in the whole wide world
1813886 i think its all part of the big latino boom in the u s
1813887 weve worked a lot of latino ingredients into our cooking and weve hit the second wave now people are thinking past hard shell tacos and looking for more authentic flavors

1813890 continuous exchange of gaseous substances between plant leaves and the surrounding atmosphere
1813891 while it is true that plants remove carbon dioxide from the air and the ability of plants to remove certain other pollutants from water is the basis for some pollution control methods the ability of plants to control indoor air pollution is less well established as a practical means of pollution control the plant removal mechanisms appear to be inconsequential compared to common ventilation and air exchange rates in other words the ability of plants to actually improve indoor air quality is limited in comparison with provision of adequate ventilation
1813892 what this filter does it performs the function of about 100 200 potted plants in removing chemicals such as formaldehyde from the indoor environment
1813893 now when you pull the air down through there this activated carbon and we have a dry and wet zone this filter absorbs all these nasty chemicals including formaldehyde benzin what have you it traps them and what happens the plant microbes convert these trapped chemicals into a source of energy and food for the plant and the microbe

1813905 great literature creates a level of empathy for other peoples lives with all its emotional intellectual and philosophical complexities in a way that no polemic or journalism memoir or blogging can do lazarus rocked my world because it magically weaves historical fact autobiography journalism fictional narrative and real and imagined characters into a work of art that draws haunting parallels between the anti anarchist hysteria of 1908 chicago the violent nationalism and wars in the balkans and americas post 9 11 xenophobia and politics of fear more amazingly it helped me to feel the struggles as i sit here in lilly white marin county of not only the books main characters lazarus averbuch and vladimir brik but of every muslim mexican or dark skinned immigrant or citizen in america today
1813906 the bush administrations attitude has always been that they can construct the most outrageous realities and then sell them as self evident much like project runway
1813907 somehow somewhere along the way thinking while reading became undesirable a lot of readers started reading for comfort not for doubt to me this is at some level definitely connected with the decrease in civic agency people are afraid to think for themselves and then voice those thoughts in a public space there is a loss of intellectual self confidence all across the board for capitalism prefers a non thinking consumer to a thinking citizen the restoration of public space in blogosphere i think alleviates that problem i hope it can also provide space for a resurgence of serious literature

1813915 while im saddened even shocked by the guilty verdict it is not for a layman like me to judge the sandiganbayan justices who rendered the decision i may choose to disagree or be disheartened by the sentence of reclusion perpetua but the justices obviously had better access to all d information and evidence they need to arrive at their unanimous decision

1814141 the tsunami was nothing compared to the impact of tourism it is a much larger long term problem i was born in 1972 and when i was eight or nine it was still largely virgin rainforest here on the island by the late 1980s though it was mostly developed we have now lost so much of the biodiversity and primary forest and the soil is destabilising in many places the construction of hotels upstream is creating a lot of sediment in the water and this causes damage to the coral reefs when it washes out to sea it also affects the mangroves on the east coast a lot of our waste water about 40 per cent is still being pumped out to sea on the west coast where all the resort areas are land is now so expensive here due to tourism the cost of living is even higher than bangkok it has meant that many local people have been forced to sell off their ancestral home and have now lost their only real asset there is even competition for schools here for the first time and there is a lot of overfishing here this is for export rather than for the tourists per se but lobsters are now being brought in from burma to meet the tourists appetite for these vulnerable creatures the corals are also damaged by tourism snorkellers actually cause more damage than divers because they touch the coral more often
1814142 we have to explain that looks can be deceiving and that it looks like fog but actually the air quality is good

1814144 i dont drop out of races in my backyard let alone ones i fly to the other side of the world for but i did this one i had no option after two laps about 25 minutes of riding very comfortably with the lead group up and down the short steep pitches of lashan mountain and thinking i could probably attack whenever i wanted and win for a while my lungs stopped working it started with a routine deep breath on a descent to recover a bit which produced a sharp pain and fit of hacking
1814145 then progressed rapidly to a state where i was unable to take more than one quarter of a breath even that producing coughing hacking spitting up all sorts of gross stuff and feeling nauseous
1814146 i become bored so quickly but i really liked the material i just try to do good material how its made is secondary anyway its really nice to receive a decent pay cheque
1814147 i do like the challenge of finding material people dont want to risk a lot of money on and that studios dont necessarily jump to and go yeah we want to tell that story how could i not after i had done monster everybody wondered how that movie could be successful
1814148 and it took a woman a first time female director to offer me that role paul haggis director of crash and in the valley of elah recently said to me you know often its the material that will define an actor but you didnt do that you defined yourself with what you chose to do i thought that was a nice compliment
1814149 i could see from a distance that she was not someone who youd want to mess with a lot of the women i met with who were also incredibly talented actors had a much sweeter softer side but i think aileen became incredibly strong and disciplined and macho so an inability to deal with confrontation would never have worked
1814150 i was trying to make the correlation between aileen wuornos and her experiences when she was very young and i was reminded of something that happened to me
1814151 i was five years old and we were driving all the cars stopped because a truck had rolled over and was ablaze and there was a man trapped inside
1814152 in south africa everybody carries a weapon and the man begged for someone to shoot him
1814153 nobody could get him out so somebody shot him it was horrific but definitely a moment that made me have a great value for life other things in life have taught me not to take a moment for granted
1814154 people drank some people drank more but it was never considered that this might be a problem it was just the way it was then
1814155 her personal life represents a grand metaphor of south africas move from agony to achievement
1814156 i dont think i want to be a pin up for anything the people who inspire me are the ones who just live life and live it in a way thats good natured do unto others what you want done unto yourself
1814157 enjoy life travel adventure enjoy i try to just live my life in as good and authentic a way as possible and i just wish people would write about that and the matter of fact way that that is rather than on a summers day her mother shot her father
1814158 i live my life the way i want to i have chosen this life i want to be able to go to sleep at night and feel that im not haunted and im happy and that i enjoy my friends and my love and that if this is all gone tomorrow that it was good
1814159 i dont believe in charmed lives i think that tragedy is part of the lesson you learn to lift yourself up to pick yourself up and to move on
1814160 it just bummed me out because i was what do you want
1814161 no i think its the opposite to that the way they focused on my appearance i felt it hurt that film i was embarrassed paul had worked really hard and they were talking about my ponytail
1814162 people arent willing to see conflict or ugliness or the more flawed side of life through a female characters eyes

1814182 if upstream emissions from heat and electricity are included emissions from buildings total 40 of global emissions and up to 80 of total greenhouse gas emissions in our cities and towns the building sector provides more potential for quick deep and cost effective greenhouse gas mitigation than any other industry
1814183 an integrated eets will improve the energy efficiency of the vast majority 98 of building stock existing buildings which hold the lowest cost abatement opportunities in the world
1814184 high value carbon credits of aud 34 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent tco2 e could realistically achieve a carbon zero position in commercial office buildings at nil cost and based on the mckinsey cost curves energy efficiency in buildings represents an estimated cost negative abatement of us 45 billion to the united states economy and 5 2 billion to the australian economy
1814185 a project only qualifies if it can prove that the emissions reduction would not have occurred without the project in its strictest sense this means that the project must not have been financially feasible without carbon credits

1814245 on 14 june 07 at least 16 members of the k of c in the legislature defeated the efforts of 170 000 signatories to put traditional marriage on the 2008 ballot
1814246 as supreme knight for the past 7 years carl anderson has refused to expel the pro abortion and pro sodomite politicians and members they anderson and devin must go supreme chaplain bishop william lori and the other bishops must excommunicate the pro abortion and pro homosexual politicians and members
1814247 devin is an attorney and as such he should know parliamentary procedure but he apparently chose to ignore that when he made that ruling how can a resolution that merely calls for the knights to honor their own constitutions article 162 7 be ruled unconstitutional

1814264 if it is decided to fight be prepared to fight bring a backpack entrenching tool tent and other equipment of an infantrymen you will need it for bush and his supporters decides it is better to fight than to accept the will of the people the fight to overthrow them will be a long fight
1814265 it takes three things to overthrow a tyrant 1 popular support you must have the majority of the people on your side i e democracy even the communists and islamics both try to show they have the support of the majority of the people 2 organization to perform the overthrow this is why madison wrote the first like he did these are how you organize an opposition without the first it is hard to organize an opposition and any resistence organized in absence of the rights stated in the first tend to be as tyrannical as what you are opposing 3 weapons to push the issue if the leadership that is being overthrown tries to use force to stay in power you have to be willing to answer force with force weapons do not overthrow a tyrant weapons just protect the people who are overthrowing a tyrant
1814266 you have more weapons in the above calibers than any other calibers thus should be your first choice in weapons saying this i must point out i like the 7x57 and 7 92x57 mauser rounds and the m1898 mauser bolt action rifle but the 7 92 sometime called 8mm mauser but these rounds are less common than the above and thus harder to obtain when re supply is needed and re supply will be needed if the struggle lasts for any length of time re supply of ammunition has always been the bane of any military operations without ammunition you can not fight to get you ammunition it is easier if we can keep the number of different rounds to a minimum i e 5 56x45 and 7 62x51 i list the 30 06 and 30 30 winchester rounds for these are two very popular rounds and ammunition for both are easy to obtain the same with the 12 gauge shotgun i list the 7 62 ak round do to the huge number of skss and aks imported since the fall of the soviet union i list it for while there are probably more 30 30s and 30 06 rifles out they than 7 62 aks and skss the aks and skss may very while outnumber the rifles in 5 56x45 and 7 62 nato also if it is decided to fight be prepared to fight bring a backpack entrenching tool tent and other equipment of an infantrymen you will need it for bush and his supporters decides it is better to fight than to accept the will of the people the fight to overthrow them will be a long fight

1814421 if you just look at the main stage and say heres what the festival is about youre missing most of the festival
1814422 one of the things weve learned is that certain acts belong on certain stages you wouldnt put a chamber music ensemble in a football stadium were presenting more intimate acts and straight ahead bands in the rep were using the imax theater for the smith dobson stage because those bands need a quieter and more intimate space

1814466 what word has pat ford gotten from the state ethics commission
1814467 we have learned that the preliminary inquiry docketed and concerning mr ford has terminated without a formal investigation
1814468 and when you say pat ford has been cleared to explain cleared of what he was never charged with anything what was going on here to recap what the state ethics commission was looking at what was he cleared of
1814469 a the state ethics commission was investigating or had conducted a preliminary into certain nominal gifts received by mr ford from a lamar executive those gifts were not violative of law and therefore no formal investigation is merited
1814470 he himself had requested that the state ethics commission look into this conveyed that the ura board which passed that on he requested and was granted a paid leave of absence with word that the state ethics commission review is over what does pat ford want to have happen next
1814471 we have formally and respectfully requested that mr ford be fully restored to his position as executive director of the ura and that correspondence and request was sent to the counsel for the ura this morning
1814472 what was the scope of what they were looking at and what did they say specifically about what they found and what they did not find
1814473 the scope i believe was limited to these so called gifts that mr ford received i think anyone who seriously believed that a multi million dollar billboard project could be influenced by a couple of ties and cigars is foolish this entire matter was a political tempest in a teapot mr ford did nothing wrong he did not violate the law and now he has been exonerated by an inquiry which was really not necessary but for political reasons went forward we have been advised that no formal investigation would follow and thats our understanding of the law and the state of the matter now
1814474 when you say for political reasons went forward he himself asked made it known that he wanted the state ethics commission to look at this from his point of view to clear his name
1814475 that is correct because there are those out there who were sullying his name such as council president doug shields for example grandstanding on the issue raising all sorts of concerns in the media and publicly that there was something improper about a friend receiving a christmas gift from another friend
1814476 it was necessary to combat councilman shields and his political tactics to request this investigation no investigation will occur we had a preliminary inquiry and it has concluded that there is no formal investigation merited
1814477 given the fact that it took this many months any regrets that he asked for the paid leave of absence could he should he have stayed on the job all of this time
1814478 well he certainly could have stayed on the job all of this time however for political reasons that didnt happen it is unfortunate for the city that political grandstanding resulted in the temporary leave of a decent public servant it has been my privilege to represent pat ford and i am pleased to return a decent public servant to the service of our public
1814479 did either the mayor or yarone zober as chief of staff and in his capacity as an official of the ura pressure or encourage pat ford to take a leave of absence while this was reviewed
1814480 well there were certainly discussions with mr zober and mr ford insisted upon his innocence and insisted upon a fair and proper treatment of the accusations against him i dont want to characterize the interaction any further than that mr zober is of course mr fords boss at the ura and they need to go back and work together and work through any difficulties that this painful process has caused
1814481 how would you characterize mr fords relationship with the mayor going forward can you at this point
1814482 well i know that pat ford is fond of the mayor and looks forward to working with him understands the difficult position that the mayor was placed in by virtue of the president of council and real political avarice that seems to be going on in our city these days its kind of disappointing to see such politics of personal destruction being played out by a city council president instead of moving forward with the business of the city we had the business of the city halted for four months while we proved something that should have been obvious to everybody from the outset
1814483 you single our the comments of council president doug shields specifically as a source of politicizing this in your view
1814484 there were bloggers who had spotlighted the friendship between pat ford and jim vlasach of lamar advertising any comments about the way the information about their friendship came to light and the way it was spotlighted
1814485 i think the bloggers are a red herring in all of this i know theyd like to think of themselves as a real important piece of the story but the politics are really occurring upstairs and not down there

1814489 i went blind deaf and dumb id read the words and these ideas streamed through my body that started a process thats still at work today
1814490 not so much is known about her and everyone wonders and projects was she gay or was she straight did she have sex should she have been on prozac thats all well and good but i think her magnificence is in her words
1814491 one of the things i really like about his writing is that you can hear hes drawing from a lot of different musical traditions but he manages to make them work together in a very interesting way
1814492 it has a relevant contemporary sound but it always feels accessible
1814493 the way people are introduced to her in freshman english they tend to put her in a certain box being meek and mild talking to the flowers insects and birds
1814494 but she dealt with some of the most extreme emotions particularly in the poems weve chosen she talks about loneliness being so far worse than death but on the other hand its the maker of the soul she explores worlds that most people do not want to examine

1814544 the letter that the iranians presented to mr solana yesterday is disappointing
1814545 we dont think it is responsive and we have to take that into account as we consult with our partners on next steps
1814546 expecting the security council will not take that into account and remain static is unrealistic
1814547 we havent set any deadlines ourselves for their response and there is ongoing dialogue
1814548 to the best of my knowledge there has been no firm agreements or understandings or any kind of concerted work in this regard
1814549 the negotiating track is open and it is being pursued and there are contacts between the parties
1814550 so lets try to focus on what kind of opportunities those negotiations can bring about

1814595 combining the organizations will allow the nationwide brand to set itself apart from the competition by aligning our entire product and service portfolio around the customer
1814596 a simpler ownership structure will open new opportunities for stronger top line growth by attracting new customers as well as retaining current customers with a broad and integrated product offering it will also facilitate more effective deployment of capital across the enterprise putting more assets to work where they can deliver the best value for customers
1814597 while nfs current structure has served us well over the past decade our ability to grow and meet the needs of our customers over the next decade and beyond will benefit from a simpler and more customer centric business model
1814598 we believe that this transaction will create great benefits for our customers business partners and associates under terms that provide fair value for the public shares in light of the difficult economic and capital markets environment we were particularly pleased that the price represents an attractive premium to nationwide s original proposal

1814601 so if its insert prospective obama vp here what will our vp be facing in the debate
1814602 if i were walking through the slums of of bangkok what kind of weapon would i need to fend bayh kaine sebelius etc off are we talking knife or like some weird throwing star thing or what
1814603 concentration this strategy also allows him to see who obama chooses and to strategize accordingly
1814604 voting for barack obama is the political equivalent of bunjee jumping
1814605 i think that we need to develop some strong contrast ads knocking the tire gauge proposal
1814606 i havent made a decision about my vice president yet
1814607 in contrast those polled said they have heard too little about presumptive republican nominee john mccain 38 percent said there is not enough coverage of the arizona senator and 26 percent think there is too much there is however a break across party lines republicans said they have heard too much about obama and too little about mccain meanwhile 57 percent of democrats think the coverage of their partys presumptive nominee has been just right
1814608 they are a life story not a life oratory but a life story
1814609 it is simply a matter of fact that less than four years ago he was a state legislator
1814610 its not even a close call in my book as to who you want in sitting in the oval office as president of the united states leader of the free world commander in chief
1814611 i know that senator mccain likes to call himself a maverick and the fact is there have been times where in the past he did show independence from his party
1814612 but the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position and now he embraces the failed bush policies of the last eight years
1814613 you cant be a maverick when politically its working for you and then not a maverick when it doesnt work for you when youre seeking your partys nomination
1814614 but i also dont think that thats a way to become energy independent
1814615 last night after all that senator mccain actually said he agreed that keeping our tires inflated was a good idea
1814616 so in the coming days its going to be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1814617 true energy independence requires john mccains all of the above approach which includes alternative energy additional offshore oil drilling and safe nuclear power
1814618 last night after all that senator mccain actually said he agreed that keeping our tires inflated was a good idea
1814619 so in the coming days its going to be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1814620 i can no more disown rev wright than i can the black community
1814621 the obama camp acknowledges theres still work to do campaign officials say introducing obama is the key idea in making voters feel comfortable with him
1814622 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling
1814623 because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
1814624 but it is not surprising newt gingrich would raise that threat since he and the republican party shutdown the government in the 1990s
1814625 we shut the federal government down for a brief period in order to get a balanced budget
1814626 republicans are doing nothing but pushing the failed johnny one note policies of the past
1814627 and i think weve got a lot of energy left in us dont we
1814628 attack attack attack to drill here drill there drill now

1814631 however the fact is i do not know them because richard abanes has never ever made
1814632 those who need to know exactly what abanes found to be problematic in silvas article already know the specifics
1814633 our research told us consumers are looking for new ways to help the environment they already recycle but they want to do more

1814640 we were successful this quarter in creating value on both sides of our balance sheet
1814641 we continue to focus our underwriting activities on creating economic profits and we benefited in the second quarter from positive returns in our asset portfolio during a challenging investment environment
1814642 our underwriting portfolio continues to perform in line with our expectations
1814643 our premium numbers were lower in the second quarter primarily due to clients reducing planned exposures in an increasingly competitive market this further affirms our underwriting strategy most of our frequency based business is written with significant risk sharing and profit sharing incentives to align interests between greenlight re and our clients

1814651 hamdans trial violated two of the most fundamental criminal justice principles accepted by all developed nations
1814652 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values the rules for the guant namo military commissions are so flawed that justice could never be served from start to finish this has been a monumental debacle of american justice the judgment against hamdan undoubtedly will be challenged in legitimate courts but there is no appeal from the judgment of future generations this system was devised to permit the prosecution of alleged wrongdoing by detainees while continuing to cover up the wrongdoing by government interrogators trials that are shrouded in secrecy and tainted by coercion are the very antithesis of american justice
1814653 in the strange world of guant namo justice even if hamdan had been acquitted on all charges he would have been detained indefinitely nowhere else in the u s justice system can someone be held for life regardless of whether he is convicted or acquitted of a crime todays outcome represents nothing more than an illusion of justice it is time to shut down these commissions and put an end to this shameful chapter in american history
1814654 hamdan guilty of material support acquitted of more serious conspiracy charges

1814672 the latest predictions are that the total television market is down 3 5 to 4 5 per cent for the year that would imply the final quarter is down between 5 and 8 per cent

1814693 that is why i tell you not to worry about everyday life whether you have enough food and drink or enough clothes to wear isnt life more than food and your body more than clothing 26 look at the birds they dont plant or harvest or store food in barns for your heavenly father feeds them and arent you far more valuable to him than they are 27 can all your worries add a single moment to your life matt 6 25 27 nlt in i talk back to the devil a w tozer reminds us money often comes between men and god someone has said that you can take two small ten cent pieces just two dimes and shut out the view of a panoramic landscape god to the mountains and just hold two coins closely in front to your eyes the mountains are still there but you cannot see them at all because there is a dime shutting off the vision in each eye it doesnt take a large quantities of money to come between us and god just a little place in the wrong position will effectively obscure our view despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary most people still believe that money brings happiness rich people craving greater riches can be caught in an endless cycle that only ends in ruin and destruction how can you keep away from the love of money paul gives us some guidelines 1 realize that one day riches will all be gone 6 7 17 3 monitor what you are willing to do to get more money 6 9 10 4 love people more than money 6 11 5 love gods work more than money 6 11 6 freely share what you have with others 6 19 pharaoh and the egyptians did not follow the israelites because they missed them they followed them because they had left with all their silver and gold 2 tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold
1814694 speak now in the hearing of the people and let every man ask from his neighbor and every woman from her neighbor articles of silver and articles of gold
1814695 why have we done this that we have let israel go from serving us

1814697 each tunnel has several exits on the egyptian side so that when one is discovered and destroyed another one can be opened it is a cat and mouse game but one in which the egyptians are reluctant to pursue the smugglers
1814698 its fine with the israelis for hamas to remain strong in gaza because it means that no one forces them to seriously negotiate a peace plan
1814699 the ceasefire may be good for the people of gaza but not for us
1814700 anyone who has committed murder must also be punished with death
1814701 before hamas came into power there was a lot of crime here now we have restored order
1814702 we will take the best aspects of the iranian and the saudi arabian system
1814703 we need at least another five years before we can take on hamas
1814704 hamas is in power but it still thinks like an opposition party
1814705 you can buy your way out of prison and its even cheaper than under fatah
1814706 it would be best to die in an attack on israel
1814707 we are disappointed because israel isnt opening up the borders completely as promised thats why we will soon end the ceasefire

1814723 we are very pleased with interdigital s performance this quarter
1814724 we recorded strong recurring revenue based on good sales growth from our broad base of 2g and 3g patent licensees we also secured our first product win for our slimchip tm high performance mobile broadband ic and successfully delivered our 3g modem ip to a fabless customer
1814725 we also progressed nicely toward our top priority of growing our base of new 3g patent licensees including the very important task of signing all of the top 5 manufacturers
1814726 toward that end the u s international trade commission usitc action against samsung moved forward with the evidentiary hearing held in july we believe our case is going very well and we remain confident that we will prevail in this matter last week we also prevailed in two important legal actions one against samsung and the other against nokia the decision by the arbitral tribunal in the samsung matter confirmed interdigital s position that samsung cannot use the 2006 settlement agreement between interdigital and nokia to avoid its obligation determined by a prior arbitration panel to pay over 150 million in royalties owed for samsung s sale of 2g handsets as for nokia we believe the decision of the second circuit court of appeals clears the path for the resumption of the usitc investigation regarding nokia s sales of 3g terminal units these positive developments create the right environment for the resolution of these patent license disputes on favorable terms
1814727 our second quarter was strong with a sequential increase in royalty revenue from several of our licensees combined with a decrease in our core operating expenses as well as a decrease in litigation and arbitration costs
1814728 as is our practice we will provide an update on our expectation for third quarter 2008 revenue after we receive and review the applicable royalty reports and update our forecasts on anticipated revenue from work associated with technology solution agreements

1814921 a california investment firm has agreed to modify 200 massachusetts homeowners subprime mortgages slashing interest rates and forgiving thousands of dollars in late charges legal fees and past due interest
1814922 attorney general martha coakley sued fremont investment amp loan a lender notorious for aggressively pushing subprime mortgages during the housing boom last year winning an injunction that limited the firms right to foreclose on its 2 200 massachusetts customers
1814923 fremont has since sold off 490 of its bay state loans 200 to wmd capital markets llc and 290 to carrington mortgage services
1814924 but foreclosure expert john anderson said the pact does nothing to address the fact that many subprime borrowers are under water for many people the best thing to do would be to take the 10 000 to 25 000 that wmd is offering and walk away he said

1814944 with his unconventional condo project in a former locust point grain elevator nearly done developer patrick turner unveiled pricing for the 228 upscale units and said he expects as many as 60 buyers to close in the next month
1814945 as the housing market tanked the head of turner development group developed a strategy to forgo pre sales and wait to set prices until he finished converting the former archer daniels midland co plant into housing
1814946 the project near the tip of the locust point peninsula will be completed by mid september when the first home buyers should move in
1814947 two years ago gary caruana built more than 40 homes in the region this year he says hell be lucky to get four or five built it takes appointment after appointment after appointment to get them under contract said caruana head of virginia beach based caruana homes inc and gtc homes
1814948 its not a line of business that were coveting in this environment said ben berry ceo of gateway bank amp trust co whose parent company is based in virginia beach
1814949 some builders say now that they overpaid for properties that developers made available for example caruana said he bought 10 lots in the great bridge area of chesapeake in late 2005 for 315 000 apiece despite misgivings about the cost several are still vacant he said and their values have plunged
1814950 william brice president of watab construction corp in norfolk recalled having the same problem some developers he said required that builders buy a minimum number of lots which required taking on additional debt
1814951 they had us over a barrel but you had to take it brice said
1814952 jane hwang spent 120 000 and devoted five years waiting for her perfect custom home then in one brief phone call she learned she might lose it all the builder seville homes couldnt pay its bills and its bank was seizing hwangs nearly completed house
1814953 despite buying the annandale home at a foreclosure auction for 700 000 hwang said losing her deposit as well as paying to complete construction and resolve lingering zoning concerns means that the home will cost her more than 50 000 over the original 800 000 price
1814954 hwang said she saw stephen korfonta sevilles owner nearby during the auction but they did not speak i was so angry she said
1814955 seville homes a small virginia builder collected hundreds of thousands in deposits in recent years for homes in northern virginia that it never delivered there are foreclosure filings on 19 seville properties including a vienna house assessed at 1 2 million and an annandale house assessed at 1 million a 2 2 million five bedroom home owned by korfonta personally has also been in the foreclosure process
1814956 it is common for some small builders to use a buyers deposit to help fund operations instead of putting it in escrow said kenneth wenhold director of the mid atlantic region for metrostudy
1814957 some seville customers whose homes have not been delivered are still hoping for their money back jeewon kim heard the news about the foreclosure of her five bedroom house in annandale from a friend kim immediately called korfonta who she said agreed to return her 50 000 deposit she did not receive the first payment which was due in may
1814958 but another is due in september we have to find a way to make him pay us the money back she said
1814959 here is what a prospective buyer would encounter while touring one foreclosed home in spotsylvania county a tree lay on the roof and blocked the front entrance it was unclear how long the tree which apparently was hit by lightning had been on the vacant home
1814960 theres mold in the refrigerator and water damage in the basement its difficult to take the smell for long realtors say that house which is under contract is in worse shape than most foreclosures but inspectors say its not uncommon to find significant damage and many require thousands of dollars of repairs before theyre move in ready
1814961 its mind boggling said joel webber who has run the stafford county based old dominion home inspection services since 1998
1814962 webber said the vast majority of his inspections these days are on homes in foreclosure many area residents have lost the pricey homes purchased during the peak of the housing boom a couple of years ago
1814963 webber questioned why the banks wouldnt take better care of the homes if theyre trying to sell them suzy stone a realtor in spotsylvania said some banks do fix up the homes but she said most buyers of foreclosures know there will be some problems many of the buyers are investors they buy them on the cheap sink in some money for repairs and flip them
1814964 stone said that frequently people take their appliances out of the home before theyre forced to leave theyll also often leave trash behind and neglect the lawn as they no longer care about the home old food is sometimes left in refrigerators
1814965 i opened the front door and couldnt go in it was so bad stone recalls of one foreclosure home she was showing
1814966 the new owners will frequently have to repaint the home and put in new carpeting and flooring stone said but thats sometimes worth it considering how little some of the homes are selling for stone said the aforementioned house in spotsylvania was listed for less than 120 000 about a 50 percent discount from what it might have sold for a couple of years back
1814967 the suit filed one week ago indicates the pestanas would not have gone into foreclosure if they had reached someone at wamu with authority to resolve their problem
1814968 i think its interesting that in massachusetts people are suing to stay in loans plus damages of course and in florida they are suing to get out of deals
1814969 now that ive bought these two nags behind your back we wouldnt have to pay a stable to board them if we bought a horse ranch
1814970 the bad news ive found out that there is not a huge demand out there by women to meet 50 something overweight average looking guys with no money
1814971 but honey youll have to park on the street its gonna get scratched up
1814972 im somewhat pleased that the number of building permits is down but weve got a real problem in certain pockets of the community where the empty houses are leaving a bad impression of the neighborhood
1814973 they keep forgetting that many of these young hip urbanists dont have much money
1814974 these people werent going to hold onto their properties they were renters who just happened to sign a mortgage
1814975 rhode who already is living in another home just hopes that eventually the market will pick up again
1814976 want hope in one hand and shit in the other see which one gets the fullest
1814977 fremont has since sold off 490 of its bay state loans 200 to wmd capital markets llc and 290 to carrington mortgage services
1814978 with his unconventional condo project in a former locust point grain elevator nearly done developer patrick turner unveiled pricing for the 228 upscale units and said he expects as many as 60 buyers to close in the next month
1814979 it was obvious to us that some of them were just making up information to complete the cards
1814980 and more importantly if the application is not completed and we cant reach the person they are not going to be registered

1814987 it was we allah who revealed the law to moses therein was guidance and light and in their footsteps we sent jesus the son of mary confirming the law that had come before him we sent him the gospel therein was guidance and light

1814990 i have never favoured a nanny state attitude the over regulation of our citizens of dictating to anyone on what anyone can or cannot do but the one area i can make an exception is the tobacco industry by 2025 it should be illegal to sell tobacco products in the eu that would give 15 years notice for all our citizens to realise just how serious we arer about not allowing the continued sale within the eu and hopefully elsewhere of products that may be legal but are not legitimate
1814991 what if someday it becomes illegal to even speak the name jesus who would you stand for then

1814996 no matter how pressed you are for time please stop for a red light

1815075 the question going forward is whether the new assertiveness and diplomatic activism and with them the divergence from u s policies will continue this is a question of great importance to the new u s administration except in the case of egypt the foreign policies of the countries discussed depend heavily on the position taken by individual leaders so they could easily change however gulf countries are now richer more developed and courted by many for their oil gas and investment and thus are less likely to simply follow the u s lead without questions whether the policies of these countries will diverge from those of the united states depends as much on u s choices as on theirs

1815140 when apportioning the increase in value and or profits from a separately held business it is not error to apportion both profits net earnings and increase in value whether that is goodwill or a measurable increase in value of some other asset if the community labor was responsible for a portion of both and if such an apportionment will achieve substantial justice between the parties citing we hold that the trial court must equitably apportion the combined total of the profits net distributable earnings and increase in value whether goodwill or otherwise of the separate business if the efforts of the community caused a portion of that increase and substantial justice requires it
1815141 determine the reasonable value of the communitys services and allocate that amount to the community and treat the balance as separate property
1815142 if the community is paid a fair return for its labor the increase or profits from the separate property remain separate only if such return has not been paid or was not reasonable would the community have a claim to the growth in value of the separate property
1815143 the increase in value of the separate business which resulted from community efforts was offset by the amount of compensation community property that each party received during the marriage
1815144 no request was made of the trial court to determine the amount of the net distributable earnings paid to the community neither was there a request to determine that the same two thirds one third ratio as to value goodwill applied to net earnings

1815284 everything was going very well until we arrived in maoz esther
1815285 from behind a little hill suddenly emerged some cars and policemen wearing civilian clothes but with police hats and they arrested the one who shot in the air as well as some of our other escorts who were carrying weapons
1815286 apparently the police were waiting and watching the whole time doing nothing until our boy shot in the air
1815287 the fact is that police forces were there we understood that like last week when there was a violent incident when the hikers came to the bedouin with weapons we were ready because we knew that this was a place of confrontation the bedouin set up cameras and therefore the police were there
1815288 if the police were there and watched the confrontation why did the police not just stand openly and prevent the hikers from passing if it was not permitted why did they not just stop them the situation as i see it looks like an ambush hiding out like thieves in the night im not the one who decides there are officers above me who decide what is overt and what is concealed

1815300 holland are a very strong team along with brazil and argentina and they have quality big name players but on the day of a game big names do not matter its teamwork and anything can happen
1815301 i am not sure if i will feature in the game because we had a training session and when i went to shoot i felt a sharp pain in my left knee
1815302 when i try to sprint its painful but i have been getting treatment to give myself the best chance its a lot better than when i first did it and i can jog now so hopefully i can feature in the game
1815303 its really frustrating but if i dont feature i will be there cheering the team on
1815304 nevertheless the additional 74 million paid by state farm pursuant to the mississippi department of insurance reevaluation program apparently meets the minimum payments required under our original state court settlement agreement
1815305 perplexing that he hood would take full credit for a program he opposed and was the foundation for the lawsuit he filed against us and has now just settled however we are pleased the attorney general understands state farm has met its obligations under the agreement his office made
1815306 that is news to me we have made an agreement with the coach that because he now has good players he should deliver we want to give him a chance and review his performance at a later stage let me make it clear that it is not our style at notwane to fire and hire coaches
1815307 well give wilson time to show what he can do but we know he is a quality player
1815308 he hasnt played at all during the build up to this season and hasnt been through a full pre season training programme
1815309 wilson has had one training session with us and then we were given clearance to play him against chasetown he is a player who could strengthen our squad and we will make a decision after he has been with us a little longer
1815310 we were there scratching our heads looking into the trenches thinking this could be it
1815311 so we did some more research and then we found the angled walls
1815312 its in the right place its at the right angle to be a polygonal shape
1815313 the first thing i want to know about it is what the foundations can tell us about the architecture

1815317 i am not yet sure what has transpired so far in terms of their meeting however
1815318 generally a 1 increase in the price of a barrel of oil on the open market translates into an increase for the whole department of 130 million
1815319 the implication of that is since these fuel costs go into our operations and maintenance budgets those are going to be the budgets that are hit the hardest
1815320 the problem is that those are the very same budgets that are paying for our operations in places like iraq and afghanistan so its kind of a vicious circle and a very very difficult one to deal with
1815321 we anticipate over the next three months that the increase in fuel costs for the department will be 1 2 billion
1815322 im just not sure that the iraqi government would respond the way we might hope them to
1815323 my guess is that we are going to see something like other cases in the past where the pentagon forged ahead in the science and technology world because it was impelled to do so
1815324 my father if it is possible let this cup of suffering be taken away from me yet i want your will not mine

1815330 you run into some like minded people out there and you get into some good conversations
1815331 all of the guys who go out to work the booth are sportsmen in one form or another
1815332 the republicans cant stake their claim on the second amendment
1815333 we try to get a field grade shotgun a camouflage duck gun and a turkey gun
1815334 after the beijing olympics there will be only one big show on earth and that is the 2010 world cup in south africa media interest in the world cup will intensify and from an organising point of view we need to move from a centrally based headquarters to a decentralised structure
1815335 in each host city we must begin to build a structure that will deliver this world cup in all 10 host cities the event will take place in with the infrastructure required to deliver in each of those cities the appointment of the venue managers is therefore a first step and a very important step in that process
1815336 always be wary of any helpful item that weighs less than its operating manual
1815337 theyre voting against themselves we have to speak up and say so
1815338 would lead to the complete demolition of the middle class
1815339 id like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves and i hope we passed the audition
1815340 even if you were the worst carbon emitter in the world if you wrote a huge check you could claim to be carbon neutral

1815344 have just decreed death to all jews and all americans
1815345 unable to give investigators an adequate explanation for his late night laboratory work hours around the time of both anthrax mailings
1815346 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1815347 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1815348 the faa does in all due respect an incredibly incomplete investigation
1815349 i am looking forward to the drive for the womens resource center golf tournament and hopefully this inaugural tournament will bring additional awareness to the outstanding services this organization provides centre county
1815350 this is a cause that is very close to my heart because of what the womens resource center does for women and families in need with recent budget cuts it is now more important that our community step up and give them our support
1815351 she has been a tremendous asset to our program we wish her all the best in her future
1815352 quentin is convinced britney will be brilliant shes delighted she thinks it could turn her career around

1815354 the power of teh cell 111 one is so great that developers are scared to use it lest it becomes skynet
1815355 we should sell 70 million barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve for less expensive crude which in the past has lowered gas prices within two weeks
1815356 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
1815357 i do not believe that we should use this strategic oil reserves at this point
1815358 i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said that we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency
1815359 fight them until all opposition ends and all submit to allah
1815360 my headmaster sent me home last week because i hadnt paid the school fees
1815361 im looking in the computers for copper and iron which i can sell to pay the fees
1815362 chemicals like lead are very dangerous especially for children they affect the brain when it is developing and therefore cause a lower iq when they grow up
1815363 other chemicals we found cause cancer or disrupt your hormone system
1815364 my research shows that about 90 of the computers are just junk they just dont work this is dumping
1815365 about 10 are put to good use the rest go straight to agbobloshie dump site and other dumps around the country where they contaminate ground water surface water the rivers and the streams and they all end up in the sea and thats where we get all the fish
1815366 it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence liberates others
1815367 it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence liberates others
1815368 the secret to success can be found in peoples daily agendas if they do something intentional to grow everyday they move closer to reaching their potential if they dont their potential slowly slips away over the course of their lifetime
1815369 i have over the last two years acquired a fleet of 12 cars and several houses in mutare and in the capital harare
1815370 when the diamond rush began very few people believed the stones were precious in fact a company which had been doing some explorations here even went as far as to say the stones were worthless industrial diamonds
1815371 we had nothing to lose because we had little to occupy our time as street dwellers we collected as many stones as possible and when buyers started flooding in we realised we had made a lot of money
1815372 the whole area is like a militarised zone which can only be accessed by the powerful there are checkpoints leading into and out of marange complete with sniffer dogs
1815373 one of the vice presidents has a big diamond field which is guarded by the military during the presidential campaigns president robert mugabe visited a diamond field together with the first lady grace mugabe we dont know the reason behind the visit but one of the most heavily guarded fields is said to belong to the first family
1815374 unfortunately our clients are not the traditional tourists they are diamond traders who usually hire the services of local prostitutes and many actually pay using the scarce us dollar
1815375 there has been an upsurge in crime and corruption following the discovery of diamonds our cells in the city are full and we are now holding some of the suspects in police cells outside mutare it is either that the suspect stole somebody elses diamonds or sold another person fake diamonds
1815376 most of them are here to pay bail money for friends relatives or spouses engaged in diamond trade
1815377 cases of children dropping out of school are higher in marange where the diamond fields are found
1815378 the explanation from the children and their parents is that they see no need to pursue education when diamond panning can provide instant riches
1815379 after seeing the change in lifestyles of other people in the city
1815380 transactions in most commodities and services such as medical consultations rentals even purchasing firewood are now done in foreign currency even commercial sex workers now demand payment in foreign currency
1815381 i resigned from the civil service just over three years ago and used to ply the border route when it was less lucrative when the diamonds were discovered business improved and i have increased the number of my taxis to four

1815387 i am very proud to have the opportunity to work with paul ince everybody in world football knows what a great player he was and to have the opportunity to learn from him is fantastic it can only help to make me a better player
1815388 training has been great the facilities at blackburn are the best i have experienced and all of the players and coaching staff made me feel really welcome
1815389 the atmosphere was friendly and bubbly and i am here to work hard learn and to impress
1815390 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1815391 and in total they caused widespread losses by banks retailers and consumers
1815392 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1815393 that was the first time ever that a computer system was wiretapped
1815394 obviously we werent happy that a person working for us as an informant was double dealing
1815395 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1815396 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1815397 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1815398 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1815399 replace underscores with hyphens in search engine results words separated by underscores will run together while hypens will create a space between each word
1815400 revise your site to ensure that people know exactly what the next step is if you want a visitor to click a link tell them
1815401 we have said that we want to focus on the three sectors industry energy health care and that we want to concentrate on them
1815402 foundered on the shoals of a capricious and rapidly evolving it market
1815403 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1815404 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1815405 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1815406 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1815407 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1815408 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1815409 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1815410 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1815411 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1815412 who are open to doing something on the production side
1815413 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1815414 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1815415 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1815416 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1815417 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1815418 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1815419 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1815420 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1815421 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1815422 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1815423 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1815424 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1815425 we have performed extremely well so far this year and built a backlog that positions us very well for the foreseeable future
1815426 i am delighted that the bill has finally gone through parliament
1815427 the office of the attorney general and minister of justice still has the residual powers to terminate any prosecution that is not in the interest of the public
1815428 there is additional value to the government for the additional fuel offload amount above threshold
1815429 appears to justify a bigger aircraft with greater fuel offload capability
1815430 numerous violations of the arms export control act and contract fraud
1815431 the aey contract shows that the procurement process at the department of defense is dysfunctional
1815432 it appears that the army agreed to pay 300 million for ammunition it could have gotten for free
1815433 we are required by statute and by federal regulations to use specific policies and procedures
1815434 one of the key suspects in the cocaine matter is now in police custody i was intimated by a resident of makeni that he has seen manley in the township i instructed him to convince manley so that he can be easily taken to freetown he succeeded in bringing him to calaba town where he was arrested and brought to the police headquarter for identification
1815435 we have not proffered any changes of cocaine against arrested persons because it involves forensic investigation which is not in the reach of the slp we are working with our international partners to ensure that proper investigation is carried out
1815436 projections are its going to become an enormous enterprise and there will be undoubtedly lots of companies both as contractors and otherwise that will locate around the building
1815437 this is expected to be the premier supporter of the most advanced thinking in far reaching intelligence research new stuff that hasnt been thought of
1815438 how is it that the process was so flawed these mistakes are so glaring
1815439 the air force will do everything we can to rapidly move forward so america receives this urgently needed capability
1815440 the air force will select the best value tanker for our nations defense while being good stewards of the taxpayer dollar
1815441 our review of the record led us to conclude that the air force had made a number of significant errors that could have affected the outcome of what was a close competition between boeing and northrop grumman
1815442 the rapid growth of the dod budget since fy 2000 leaves the department increasingly more vulnerable to the fraud waste and abuse that undermines the departments mission
1815443 directly linked to requests by congress to increase both audit and investigative efforts regarding southwest asia and the global war on terror
1815444 forced us to adjust priorities resulting in gaps in coverage in important areas such as major weapon systems acquisition wrongdoing by senior officials whistleblower protection health care fraud product substitution and defense intelligence agencies
1815445 the pentagons top cop is outgunned and its high noon
1815446 not able to provide adequate audit coverage of dod acquisition programs given the dollars expended by the department
1815447 18 of substantiated allegations against senior officials resulted in immediate removal from command reprimands reduction in rank and reimbursement to the government
1815448 angel was our top candidate for the position and we are delighted that she has agreed to come to gaithersburg
1815449 she has an extensive background in community development and collaboration and we look forward to angel working closely with residents staff and elected officials to help our community navigate a future that is filled with both challenge and opportunity
1815450 itll be a knowledge partnership for employability which will see industry experts provide soft skill inputs to students
1815451 we are honored that our government customer has entrusted our team to build this vital system which will provide improved gps accuracy and assured availability for military and civilian users worldwide
1815452 the global positioning system provides precise timing and positioning information for military and civil users it is the main reason our smart bombs can operate through cloud cover and it is probably the most important navigational tool devised in the postwar period
1815453 you have military troops all over that have to communicate and theyre dependent on satellites
1815454 consider solutions which lower cost or risk to deliver within or below budget
1815455 continuing a dod push to award fees more carefully and on a more objective basis
1815456 dod is always looking for the latest technology for its satellites
1815457 the problem is that technology develops quickly but the development of the satellite itself takes a while by the time it gets to its maturity you realize theres more advanced technology out there so you add that at the last minute and it leads to higher costs
1815458 one of the missiles had apparently been added to the photograph using elements from the smoke trail and dust clouds from two of the other missiles
1815459 a good guy a good man with a difficult job
1815460 without a receiving report and invoice we dont know what we paid for
1815461 investigators looked at 53 payment vouchers and couldnt find even one that adequately explained where the money went
1815462 contained sufficient supporting documentation to provide reasonable assurance that these funds were used for their intended purpose
1815463 what equipment is due in due out issued and on hand
1815464 when we turned them over to the iraqis they werent properly accounted for
1815465 we are concerned that some countries are moving down the nuclear weapons path in reaction to the iranians
1815466 the big question is at what point do you reach the nuclear tipping point when enough countries go nuclear that others decide they must do so too
1815467 we continue to take the high road but there isnt much oxygen there and it is very lonely
1815468 without a comprehensive nuclear accord you will have a proliferation problem in the middle east and it will be even worse in 10 years than it is today
1815469 this is not primarily about nuclear energy its a hedge against iran
1815470 simulation of coupled interconnects using waveform relaxation and transverse partitioning
1815471 i would like for the parents if they have a question or if they have a thought or idea theyd like to share with us id like them to come to the meeting id be glad to sit there and answer any questions
1815472 i think that kids should be able to control themselves without things like that
1815473 i think its good for bad kids because some kids dont know how to behave and that will control them i guess
1815474 i think kids nowadays they dont need any more violence you know what i mean because theres violence all around us
1815475 murphys attempt to get his judgeship back while in the middle of a state senate campaign is a very fishy development it doesnt pass the smell test
1815476 the people have a right to know whether bob murphy was promised his judgeship back after losing the state senate race the governor senate democrat leaders and mr murphy owe the people a complete disclosure and a full accounting of what commitments were made to convince murphy to run for the state senate
1815477 in his prior statements to the press bob murphy has said we need a state senator who isnt beholden to any special money interests but since that time murphy has done the opposite getting almost 70 of all of his funds from the trial lawyer lobby
1815478 im sure there are members of the trial bar who would be concerned about refusing to donate money to murphys senate campaign given the very real possibility that he will be presiding over their cases again after the election
1815479 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1815480 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1815481 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1815482 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1815483 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1815484 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1815485 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1815486 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1815487 proposal for an sdm cofdm system for wideband mobile communications achieving 100 mbit s by means of mimo channels
1815488 the data item which can be made as a reference for tuning
1815489 rf circuits technique of dual band transceiver ic for gsm and dcs1800 applications
1815490 im trying to attract new business and one of the first questions i get is
1815491 we have paid for two domain names for the city but we dont have a web site
1815492 i would expect that by september well be discussing this at the council level but for now we are just putting some numbers together
1815493 i expect a lot of concern from users but well have public meetings probably more than one so people will have an opportunity to understand why theres a need to make a change
1815494 when i graduated from high school in 1974 and went to the air force academy i wasnt ready i was using a slide rule and the academy already had computers from texas instruments the technology was already there
1815495 we want to get technology into the hands of our high school kids
1815496 were not asking for anything most progressive districts arent doing we can do a better job and our kids deserve that
1815497 when we constructed this override we realized the economic times were in arent conducive to that
1815498 this year the assessed value has gone up to 500 million which drops the tax rate one dollar
1815499 the best information we get from the county is that they dont expect the assessed valuation to go down but they dont expect it to go up very much either
1815500 the cost of this override would be about 35 cents which wont take place until the next tax year
1815501 if we wanted to buy all of the new technology we wanted to get right now wed have to raise the tax rate a lot more than what the community would probably accept we understand that we have to live on a budget too and we think this is a budget where we can get appropriate tools in the hands of teachers and kids so our kids can learn more faster
1815502 teachers use different colored markers on the whiteboard and can have students interact with it by using a projector thats connected to the computer
1815503 whats nice about it especially for a teacher teaching the same thing multiple times during the day they can plan all their lessons ahead save all their notes from day to day and pull them back up the next day
1815504 traditionally the teacher would have to use a dry eraser and try to reproduce the same activity
1815505 each child is given a remote and the teacher is given an electronic chalkboard to write on or develop questions
1815506 the teacher can ask questions and get immediate results and feedback the teacher would see the results of every student so the teacher would know who got the question right and who didnt
1815507 the teacher can then redirect instruction based on the results of the students and can immediately identify those who need assistance
1815508 some of the funds for laptops can be taken from the allotment of monies from the state school facilities board for student computers as well as those recovered from not purchasing textbooks
1815509 empire high school in tucson found that by not purchasing textbooks they save approximately 500 per student this money was then used to purchase the laptops
1815510 empire was probably the first high school in the world to go totally text book less
1815511 it doesnt mean that they dont have textbooks in their school the kids just dont have traditional textbooks
1815512 teachers can use this and teach to arizona state standards and best find the resources that benefit the students
1815513 the likelihood that student computers will be damaged beyond normal wear and tear
1815514 vail unified school district found the self insurance model worked best for them
1815515 they charge students 80 down with a 100 deductible the only downfall to model is that they had to become a collection agency when deductibles werent paid
1815516 the curriculum is the same the tools and resources that you use to teach it are different
1815517 even if you were the worst carbon emitter in the world if you wrote a huge check you could claim to be carbon neutral
1815518 even if you were the worst carbon emitter in the world if you wrote a huge check you could claim to be carbon neutral
1815519 this is not a get out of jail free card
1815520 i am feeling stronger every day and hope soon to be able to move onto soft foods
1815521 i walked 7 10 of a mile today in rehab and will walk again this evening and all without any oxygen
1815522 i feel very blessed to be given a second wind
1815523 all things have fallen into place barnes has the lung transplant procedure operating like a finely tuned machine the whole process is headed up by a transplant team
1815524 i was told by the transplant team that an average wait can be from 24 hours to 6 months
1815525 i was placed on the list on june 26 and two weeks later got the call
1815526 unfortunately with the improvement of surgical techniques and the expansion of reasons for transplants the number of needed lung transplants has not kept pace with the number of available donors
1815527 we are pleased with our accomplishments during the second quarter of 2008
1815528 overall we had a strong quarter as we achieved record net revenue with three of our oem customers each generating in excess of 20 percent of our total net revenue additionally we experienced 34 percent sequential net revenue growth and 26 percent net revenue growth on a year over year basis we remain keenly focused on improving margins and reducing costs to reach our goal of sustainable profitability
1815529 even if you were the worst carbon emitter in the world if you wrote a huge check you could claim to be carbon neutral
1815530 if you devolve responsibility to the provinces and you only give them a certain amount of money and essentially cut them adrift youre going to guarantee the withdrawal of the state from certain areas of activity that you dont already believe in
1815531 wasnt a power grab by the federal government it was an attempt to provide a minimum level of standards and services to all canadians wherever they live
1815532 thats why there are federal provincial relations thats why there are all these agreements to try to work this out provinces used to like this and many of them still do
1815533 i just watched harper speak what a sham oddly in french he can pronounce dion correctly when he speaks english he loses that ability magically take note people in english dee yawn is all the rage
1815534 stephen harper is the best leader that any of the major parties have had since jean chr tien
1815535 okay so steve and jack are buds now it is so blatant
1815536 right i dont recall harper using the english pronounciation of stephane
1815537 the kids are completely dehydrated two of them im sure theyre doing a lot of bloodwork to see if they is anything else
1815538 cloudav virtualizes and parallelizes detection functionality with multiple antivirus engines significantly increasing overall protection
1815539 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1815540 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

1815586 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1815587 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1815588 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1815589 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1815590 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1815591 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1815592 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1815593 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1815594 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1815595 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1815596 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1815597 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1815598 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1815599 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1815600 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1815601 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1815602 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1815603 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1815604 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1815605 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1815606 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1815607 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1815608 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1815609 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1815610 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1815611 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1815612 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1815613 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1815614 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1815615 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1815616 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1815617 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1815618 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1815619 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1815620 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1815621 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1815622 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1815623 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1815624 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1815625 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1815626 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1815627 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1815628 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1815629 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1815630 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1815631 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1815632 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

1815651 deleuze speaks not of realization but of actualization and introduces a novel ontological category to refer to the status of multiplicities themselves virtuality this term does not refer of course to the virtual reality which digital simulations have made so familiar but to a real virtuality forming a vital component of the objective world as he writes in difference and repetition the virtual is not opposed to the real but to the actual the virtual is fully real in so far as it is virtual indeed the vitual must be defined as strictly part of the real object as though the object has one part of itself in the virtual into which it plunged as through into an objective dimension the reality of the virtual consists of the differential elements and relations along with the singular points which correspond to them the reality of the virtual is structure

1815653 i was documenting and photographing my friend chris in detroit who was a male to female prostitute

1815655 they had a relationship for the last three years where they were all one big happy family
1815656 to report an acquaintance of hers was being reluctant to let her see her own children
1815657 basically she took in the family including the mom and then when it came time for her to give the kids back to their mom she refused and she left the area
1815658 nobody knows where she is right now thats why were doing the amber alert thats the last resort
1815659 she has a lot of excuses and we looked into each of her excuses and her reasons and determined that we needed to file charges
1815660 shes been given every chance to cooperate and do this the right way weve bent over backwards

1815665 its a good group of veterans that are back for camp this year and we are looking to those players to push the pace here and lead and be at the front of things in terms of what we want in pace and tempo
1815666 i think all of those returning players were on last years team for a reason they have a lot of character work hard and are persistent in terms of the challenges we are going to have at camp
1815667 im sure they will have that mindset that they want to have a great team so im sure they will be pushing the pace
1815668 its always fun to go against a guy like him hes a very good player
1815669 its a huge honor to make the world junior team so when you come to this camp its what everybody is shooting for
1815670 so its your job to go out there and show them the way it should be done play hard never take a shift off and keep going 110 percent out there
1815671 we dont have plea bargaining a witness protection program or witness relocation program so what we end up doing most of the time is just clipping the branches if the government would give us the tools wed shut them down but we dont have em

1815673 without exception u s officials have been told that the japanese police cannot open an investigation because possession is legal
1815674 under iraqi living conditions and participate with mitt special operations and convoy duties
1815675 there is a lot of pressure on the active army and during this transition period where the military is converting to noncombat roles a shift to contractors as trainers for the expanding iraqi military is a natural step
1815676 there are insufficient field grade officers in our own service and we need the captains and majors as we increase our own ground forces
1815677 our government agencies need to know how many contractors are in theater and how many contracting support plans our commanders are using today
1815678 we cannot ever permit another contracting disaster like we have right now
1815679 may prove to be as dangerous as groups like justice department officials used similar rhetoric in a 2003 case against a tampa area man and his associates who allegedly supported a reign of terror by a violent palestinian group

1815686 we hebben het onszelf moeilijk gemaakt we hebben het twee keer zelf weggegeven met die rode kaarten
1815687 ik vond ons goed beginnen met druk naar voren een goeie balcirculatie en veel overtuiging
1815688 maar na een tijdje verwaterde dat en ging het evenwicht uit de ploeg toch vond ik die 1 1 bij de rust ideaal maar bate speelde vinniger en gaf ons weinig ruimte er waren nog een paar schermutselingen voor doel maar we kwamen te laat
1815689 i dont pick the winner but if i did id pick sms
1815690 the investigation found that the december 2005 award to sms was tainted with improper influence irregular procurement practices and preferential treatment
1815691 lower priced offers from qualified vendors and capabilities in house were bypassed in an apparent effort to obtain services from redacted president of sms who had a longstanding relationship with senior air force officers and members of the thunderbirds
1815692 never interfered with the evaluation or selection process and never directed anyone to do or not do anything
1815693 i am deeply disappointed that our high standards were not adhered to
1815694 weer hadden we een scheidsrechter die niks van voetbal kent
1815695 maar opnieuw kregen we een rode kaart toen we alles in handen hadden bij die 1 1 geloofde ik er nog in zeker wie was eigenlijk de agressiefste ploeg op dit veld wie probeerde constant tijd te winnen weer hadden we een scheidsrechter die niks van voetbal kent sorry maar het is zo en noem me dan maar een slechte verliezer

1815712 despite previous studies suggesting a warmer climate is already taking a bite out of washingtons snowpack theres no clear evidence that human induced climate change has caused a drop in 20th century snow levels according to a new study by university of washington scientists we cant see the global warming signature in terms of a decline in snowpack
1815713 we might put the country in a bad situation in future

1815722 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1815723 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1815724 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1815725 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1815726 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1815727 no we did not receive any money back from the obama campaign at any time
1815728 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza

1815744 the pro game as we know it is very straightforward theres a style that we play you know little baseball or big baseball depending on how your teams structured
1815745 in international baseball you may be winning a game 5 0 and all of a sudden an explosion might happen the manager of the other team might come running out on to the field pointing fingers and you are going whats going on here the opposing manager is just trying to get a distraction so that they can get a momentum change
1815746 different countries play the game in different ways often times you will play some of the asian ballclubs where they are going to get a base hit in the first inning and theyre going to bunt him over and play for one run from start to finish
1815747 you are going to play the cubans and they are going to be very expressive on the field and do some things that if they were done in north america you would get pretty excited about it
1815748 the cubans are tremendous at the psychological aspects of trying to draw you into their dugout and trying to draw you off your game
1815749 if you look at a regular minor league season or regular professional season you have to equate the international game to playoff time
1815750 you cant just sit back and say we have another three games in this series or we have another 140 to play
1815751 you have to approach every game every day like its he seventh game of the world series and there is no tomorrow because the bottom line is it starts and finishes very quickly and if you dont start well you are pretty much out of it
1815752 its a do or die situation everyday so thats how you manage your roster
1815753 and yet you still have to be careful with your staff so that you dont blow them out so we count on each and every pitcher that we get they have to do their job
1815754 offensively its a little bit different thats more a case of i go with guys that i think are swinging the bat well or have the best approach i cant sit there and wait for somebody to get their stroke together and thats an unfortunate thing but its the nature of this type of international game
1815755 i always try to build quick chemistry into the ball club and a lot of people dont like my style that way but im not really interested because i feel thats the best way with these clubs
1815756 when i go over there i expect a high level of play very quickly
1815757 if you break our roster down weve respected that reality and most everybody that will put on the uniform has played international baseball and understands what they are getting into
1815758 our biggest concern is to take a team over there that has the quickest impact and can play that style of game
1815759 the youth has a tendency to energize the experience and the experience has the responsibility of insulating the youth and maintaining the level of composure you have to have when things get difficult in the international environment
1815760 hes been through every aspect of what weve done internationally in the last 15 years and hes seen it all
1815761 looking at the ballclub in athens i knew we had a real advanced experienced team in terms of age a lot of guys for the most part were on the tail end of their careers so the reality was we were going to have to transition the team
1815762 als we met elf tegen elf en bij 1 1 het laatste kwartier waren ingegaan had alles nog gekund
1815763 maar bate was degelijk georganiseerd en wij hadden weinig kansen bij ons lopen sommige spelers achter hun beste vorm aan
1815764 which for us is like jumping straight from the 19th century to the 21st century
1815765 in the mid 1960s the national park service was pursuing what one would think was an enlightened policy of trying to get the best architects in the world to design visitor centers
1815766 was a physical intrusion and an architectural masterpiece and that created controversy from day one
1815767 i rock up to training and folkesy steve folkes someone that to be honest has never paid any interest in my personal life he comes up to me and starts saying youre not turning muslim are you
1815768 i start to think who is he to question my friends
1815769 if you asked hazem el masri about how i perceive muslims youll find ive often asked him questions about the religion because i dont fully understand it
1815770 if something comes up that i heard i ask him
1815771 its certainly not right of him to say that we took no interest in his home life or personal life
1815772 i supported him through the clovelly hotel thing when he was caught allegedly having sex in the toilets with ironwoman candice falzon his drink driving thing through his urinating in public thing
1815773 we stood up for him and did our best to try and get him through that so i think it is a pretty naive statement to make
1815774 in light of what has happened my advice about him not putting too much credence into what anthony mundine says was probably good advice
1815775 who is he to come and question my friends and their values and their religion
1815776 who does he think he is does he think he is god is he god or something
1815777 yeah whatever comes out of his mouth is that right
1815778 when i did join up with khoder and asked khoder to manage me
1815779 obviously to do something like that leave i wasnt happy
1815780 i havent been happy at the dogs for a while
1815781 nothing to do with the players i love my close mates but a whole range of things
1815782 it wasnt that long ago that he signed a five year deal so i assumed to commit to somewhere for five years he was happy to commit to that
1815783 i know sonny has been going around crying poormouth about only earning 500 000 a year cant survive on that
1815784 i dont know if it is just this generation whether it is young footballers or generation y in general but they expect everything and dont want to cough up for it
1815785 they expect that everything is going to be given to them on a platter and the fact he cant survive on 500 000 a year is a bit sad really
1815786 he will do anything now to try and justify this decision regardless
1815787 i was in the room last year when he agreed shook hands and signed a deal to stay with us five years

1815793 they did some very innovative things to keep people going and their experience rewards system was something that we paid a lot of attention to
1815794 its just what happens legally sometimes not necessarily with games but you see it with music and films things get locked in this legal limbo even most of the parties involved probably all the parties involved want to solve it its such a complex issue
1815795 there is a significant possibility that braid would have been the next psychonauts or beyond good and evil critically acclaimed but nobody played it even at 10 if that happens at 10 then i am in debt and have to get a job and can t make games any more if that happens at 15 maybe i can still make games

1815849 ait planet lar graphic novels have always been worth a look publishers larry young and mimi rosenheim have an eye for unusual projects and strong creative voices among the talent theyve worked with who are now high profile names in the industry such as matt fraction and brian wood i liked the premise of the black diamond in that its premise flows from socio political issues and that real world smart quality is to be found throughout this book proctors artwork does a good job of setting a dark weird mood for this unusual story the colors are psychedelic in tone those in combination with the 1973 muscle car thats so integral to the plot and action bring a 1970s sensibility to a story set in the not too distant future it makes for an odd atmosphere that has both a playfulness and tension to it young offers action and amusement yes but theres some strong commentary about economics politics and the machinery of western society while don and kates story is a classic one the bigger picture is what helps to set the plot apart and challenge the audience

1815870 it will be difficult to measure but probably this scenario will show some increase in delinquency in both segments individuals and companies
1815871 in our view this is a result of the credit analysis that we implemented in 2006 and 2007 we had new variables in our models
1815872 to work in this scenario we have become more stringent in credit analysis our filters are more stringent we think well keep this ratio flat

1816215 its an adage but its true grand avenue got ahead of itself getting in front of a residential environment that wasnt that strong now fast forward to 2008 with over 2 000 condos being built in the last 15 years were seeing 18 000 people living downtown now and an influx of people into the third ward and fifth ward
1816216 the average consumer has been strapped but the person living downtown is not so much worried about putting 4 gas into the tank
1816217 they have money to spend on retail sixty four percent of the condo market is the baby boomers moving back theyre empty nesters
1816218 one of the complaints you always hear about grand avenue is it doesnt have this store it doesnt have that store therefore its dead

1816230 n r danmark halter efter p ligel nsomr det er det en k mpe bombe i forhold til for rets strejker
1816231 venstre har historisk set v ret t vende indtil det fodsl bende p ligestillingsomr det og dansk folkeparti er lodret imod initiativer det er derfor dybt ironisk at regering og st tteparti gerne fremh ver ligestilling som en s rlig dansk v rdi
1816232 der er en international tendens til at erkende at det ikke er nok med lidt lovgivning mod diskrimination det er n dvendigt med en positiv indsats og h ndfaste indgreb venlige henstillinger virker ikke p ligestillingsomr det alligevel er det is r s danne uforpligtende opfordringer som karen jespersen kaster om sig i stedet for at ndre p de strukturelle forhold ved lov vil hun ndre folks m de at t nke p
1816233 regeringen har selv skabt en forventning om mere ligestilling ved at tale om den til stadighed men regeringen har opgivet at g med i det nordiske arbejde for ligestilling og man v grer sig mod at tage fat p en m de der virker det bliver ved hensigtserkl ringerne og h bet p befolkningens gode vilje
1816234 det handler om forskellige m der at f re kvindekamp p kritikerne vil have en statsstyret kamp men det er jeg grundliggende uenig i jeg oplever det som en falliterkl ring at skulle bruge tvang for at f ligestilling og jeg har altid ment at et godt samfund baseres p selvst ndige mennesker der foretager frie valg
1816235 s dan som det tegner i norge medgiver jeg at der er resultater det er kanongodt at f 40 pct kvinder i bestyrelserne men brand rgerligt at det skal ske p den m de

1816239 vi er n dt til at bev ge os bort fra snavsede kul som dominerende energikilde

1816241 det er fantastisk interessant at et af g5 landene nu siger at man p egen h nd og ved egen kraft p tager sig nogle klimaforpligtelser det giver et sp ndende udgangspunkt for en mindre blokpr get diskussion om enkeltlandes ansvar for at yde en indsats
1816242 der b r v re forskel p hvad u lande som f eks singapore og maldiverne eller burkina faso og indien skal yde fordi deres situation er s forskellig sydafrikas udspil bner for s danne dr ftelser
1816243 det er min fornemmelse at indien og kina faktisk er bekymrede over udspillet fordi det netop skaber en ny situation hvor u landene ikke st r over for de rige lande i en f lles front og hvor man pludselig ikke rigtig ved hvor man har hinanden der forest r nogle meget interessante diskussioner internt mellem de store u lande

1816245 det er simpelthen vildledning af de unge der er en lang r kke unge der er kommet i klemme i det her system og de kan nu l se i avisen at der er mulighed for at f dispensation men det passer bare ikke
1816246 ministeren har sendt et skriftligt svar hvor han tager stilling til mange af de konkrete eksempler og siger at de ikke kan f dispensation alligevel bliver han ved med at sige at der er dispensationsmuligheder det kan han simpelthen ikke v re bekendt
1816247 han f r det jo til at lyde som om det bare er os der ikke vil have folk ind men det er helt forkert
1816248 det er rigtig fr kt af ham at henvise til studenten fra rhus i en kommentar om at de unge kan s ge dispensation for helge sander ved udm rket godt at universitetet ikke kan dispensere i hans sag mange kan huske hans sag og vil t nke n han kan bare s ge dispensation det kan han ogs men han kan ikke f det

1816250 nej det kan jeg ikke de unge kan s ge dispensation hvis universitetet sk nner at de har de n dvendige kompetencer

1816270 this military judge is to be commended for providing a fair and internationally legally sufficient trial for the accused and the government regardless of the ultimate verdict
1816271 but in the near term at least we would consider him an enemy combatant and still a danger and would likely still be detained for some period of time thereafter
1816272 but i think you know there are still a significant population within guantanamo who will likely never be released because of the threat they pose to the world for that matter

1816302 any time a child dies under these circumstances we as a community as a society have something to learn

1816608 i nudi e crudi dati dellistat sullo stato di salute del matrimonio in italia abbisognano di una serie di valutazioni di supporto alla diminuzione del numero di separazioni corrisponde il calo 30 del numero di matrimoni oggi nel nostro paese il matrimonio non lunica forma di famiglia atteso che sono in nettissimo aumento le coppie di conviventi more uxorio con o senza figli
1816609 le ragioni vanno ricercate nella abnorme attesa per ottenere una sentenza di divorzio per quanti hanno un matrimonio alle spalle in media in italia occorrono 8 anni per ottenere lo stato libero e la paura del matrimonio e delle sue regole specie da parte degli uomini valutate le conseguenze nefaste degli eventuali successivi separazione e divorzio perdita della casa coniugale obblighi di assegno di mantenimento riduzione netta dei tempi da trascorrere con i figli
1816610 laffidamento condiviso dice gassani da considerarsi la regola mentre quello esclusivo una residuale eccezione in media nei tribunali meridionali laffidamento condiviso risente ancora per di una cultura conservatrice che vede nella madre lunico genitore capace di esercitare la potest sui figli il vero tallone dachille dellaffidamento condiviso comunque un altro in mancanza di un percorso di mediazione familiare precedente al giudizio di separazione o divorzio e mirante a ridurre il conflitto tra i coniugi laffidamento condiviso sul piano pratico risulta spesso un fallimento lastio tra il padre e la madre vanifica i nobili obiettivi di tale legge laffidamento condiviso deve invece fondarsi sul mutuo rispetto tra i genitori e non pu tradursi in una mera imposizione da parte del giudice mediante provvedimenti emessi in pochi minuti alla prima udienza presidenziale laffidamento condiviso resta un importante obiettivo giuridico culturale della nostra societ in linea con tutti gli altri paesi europei ma esso ha bisogno di contenuti e non soltanto di mere enunciazioni di principio la vera piaga italiana la mancanza della effettiva specializzazione in materia familiare e minorile di magistrati ed avvocati attesa la estrema delicatezza di una materia che produce nelle vicende altamente conflittuali pi morti allanno rispetto a quelli causati dalla malavita organizzata tutta
1816611 lami propone una modifica della legge 54 2006 nella parte in cui prevede lautomaticit dellaffidamento condiviso sacrificando valutazioni da parte dei mediatori familiari e dei servizi sociali in merito alle capacit genitoriali delle coppie separande o divorziande che chiedono laffidamento dei figli

1816614 cos capita con via giulia la strada che partendo da centurano e passando per santa lucia arriva fino ai ponti della valle una via storica che si snoda per colline devastate dalle cave ma che rappresenta un percorso micaelico ovvero un itinerario collegato ai santuari che officiavano il culto di s michele il patrono guerriero dei longobardi che introdussero il culto dellarcangelo nel nostro territorio e infatti per questa strada passano tanti devoti e pellegrini che raggiungono la chiesa di don primo a s lucia ma anche il santuario di s michele a cavallo tra caserta e maddaloni questa arteria
1816615 che viene usata come alternativa alla variante per maddaloni quindi un luogo storico posto allincrocio di avvenimenti importanti come la battaglia del volturno un sito che meriterebbe una attenzione pi degna che lincuria vigente il paesaggio di contorno di questa area paurosamente devastato dalle escavazioni ma a questo tormentone storico si aggiunge la munnezza in particolare
1816616 davanti alla cava luserta allingresso di uno dei siti pi devastati della zona si sta ergendo una discarica in piena regola pi volte come associazione terra nostra abbiamo segnalato lincuria che regna sovrana su questa strada ma il momento particolare vede un exploit del degrado mai registrato nelle cronache dolenti del nostro territorio per la gravit del caso abbiamo deciso di rivolgerci al presidente del consiglio comunale

1816620 certi politici anche se sono vicini alle mie idee sono incompetenti non capiscono certe cose al di fuori del loro mondo non vedo perch disertare la cerimonia di apertura allora tanto valeva boicottare i giochi e poi alla ministro meloni chiedo ma lei diserterebbe loccasione della vita
1816621 i politici devono fare i politici e io sono qui per fare sport
1816622 quindi non ci penso proprio a disertare la cerimonia dapertura dei giochi tra laltro storicamente per i giochi si sospendono le guerre persino nel pugilato che viene erroneamente considerato sport violento c una fratellanza difficile da riscontrare in altri settori e poi

1816628 certe volte mi sento ancora rallentato ma passer tutto in un paio di giorni
1816629 qui ci sono condizionatori dappertutto a casa mia no e infatti ogni volta che mi alleno a marcianise consumo quattro magliette
1816630 una delle quali in casa sua qui in cina e affrontarlo di nuovo non mi spaventa certo stavolta sarebbe lolimpiade e allora per batterlo e non permettere certi trucchi dei giudici non c che un modo toccarlo e muovere molto le gambe per scappargli via danzando sul ring in modo da non farsi mai toccare yushan non mi deve proprio vedere se mi sfiorasse anche solo un braccio i giudici gli assegnerebbero il colpo con la macchinetta
1816631 devo conquistare loro dei giochi la campania non lo vince dai tempi di patrizio oliva e sar io ad interrompere il digiuno

1817070 truth is the glue that holds government together compromise is the oil that makes governments go
1817071 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil the bush plan is a hoax it will neither reduce gas prices nor increase energy independence
1817072 what were saying is exhaust other remedies mr president it is the economic life of americas families and to suggest that drilling offshore is going to make a difference to them paycheck to paycheck now is a frivolous contention
1817073 sen john mccains gas tax relief would last from memorial day to labor day hard working american families are suffering from higher gasoline prices john mccain calls on congress to suspend the 18 4 cent federal gas tax and 24 4 cent diesel tax from memorial day to labor day
1817074 there was a vote in the state senate in illinois that i opposed i voted against a moratorium on the gas tax for the same reason that i dont think its the best approach for us to take right now
1817075 it would defeat everything weve been trying to do to lower the cost of oil there are other remedies that are much better than that and again have a direct impact on the problem that were trying to solve
1817076 energy has enormous implications for our economy our environment and our national security we cannot let another year go by without addressing these issues together in a comprehensive and balanced package
1817077 this is the peoples house this is not pelosis politiburo
1817078 democratic aides were furious at the gop stunt and reporters were kicked out of the speakers lobby the space next to the house floor where they normally interview lawmakers
1817079 although this democrat majority just adjourned for the democrat 5 week vacation house republicans are continuing to fight on the house floor although the lights mics and c span cameras have been turned off house republicans are on the floor speaking to the tax payers in the gallery who not surprisingly agree with republican energy proposals all republicans who are in town are encouraged to come to the house floor
1817080 make sure your tires are properly inflated because we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
1817081 the political vision of a summer gas tax holiday died a quick death in congress losing to a view that federal excise taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel will have to go up if they go anywhere now lawmakers quietly are talking about raising fuel taxes by a dime from the current 18 4 cents a gallon on gasoline and 24 3 cents on diesel fuel

1817087 you need to show me ids with your signatures on it
1817088 if you dont want to vote there is the door and you can leave now
1817089 leroy my son and i want to vote we brought what was required of us i am holding the soss web page n my left hand if you will not look at it or read it please call charlene davis at the eastern jackson county election board or call the soss office to find out what you are supposed to do because we want to vote
1817090 you can either give me what i told you to or you can just get out that door and find someplace else to vote
1817091 leroy nope we will not leave until you give us our rights weve a right to vote
1817092 your rules do not trump the laws of this state
1817093 you either do what youre told to vote or you get out of here now
1817094 sorry cant do that what you are asking is neither legal or fair lets settle this thing
1817095 we arent bothering them we are simply trying to vote and these people are breaking missouri state statutes preventing us from voting
1817096 look you are breaking their rules if you dont get out of here we are going to arrest you
1817097 their rules what rules those are employees of the election board they are under the mandate of the election board and then the sos arent you more concerned about the breaking of state laws
1817098 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
1817099 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
1817100 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
1817101 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
1817102 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
1817103 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
1817104 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
1817105 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
1817106 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
1817107 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

1817115 from start to finish this has been a monumental debacle of american justice
1817116 the travesty of this verdict now is that had the case gone to trial in 2004 he would have been acquitted of all the charges
1817117 it convicted a truck driver of being guilty of driving a truck
1817118 the most important thing is that people are forced to open up to the world and accept different ideas
1817119 its good not only for sports but for human rights and freedom of speech
1817120 its good for the economy and more people here will get to know china and thats good
1817121 its very exciting well be cheering for china of course

1817126 not so much is known about her and everyone wonders and projects was she gay or was she straight did she have sex should she have been on prozac thats all well and good but i think her magnificence is in her words
1817127 one of the things i really like about his writing is that you can hear hes drawing from a lot of different musical traditions but he manages to make them work together in a very interesting way
1817128 it has a relevant contemporary sound but it always feels accessible
1817129 the way people are introduced to her in freshman english they tend to put her in a certain box being meek and mild talking to the flowers insects and birds
1817130 but she dealt with some of the most extreme emotions particularly in the poems weve chosen she talks about loneliness being so far worse than death but on the other hand its the maker of the soul she explores worlds that most people do not want to examine

1817149 i think weve got to accept that both parties at this stage would realistically be looking for solutions
1817150 one way or another zanu pf is in the process of committing itself to a process its busy committing itself to a process that will bind it to a legal non violent solution in that sense it should be significant
1817151 the parties express their readiness to work individually and together in the ongoing dialogue to make public undertakings in ensuring the safety of any displaced persons and their safe return home
1817152 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1817153 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values the rules for the guantanamo military commissions are so flawed that justice could never be served from start to finish this has been a monumental debacle of american justice
1817154 the travesty of this verdict now is that had the case gone to trial in 2004 he would have been acquitted of all the charges

1817157 the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement
1817158 we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing
1817159 those athletes regret that action and have written an apology to bocog on their own behalf
1817160 they now realize and understand how their actions were perceived by the host nation and by the organizing committee
1817161 while informal contact between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and irans chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili will continue we have no choice but to pursue further sanctions against iran
1817162 the p5 1 major powers are discussing next steps in the u n security council and beginning to consider possible outlines of another sanctions resolution
1817163 we are very disappointed that iran has failed yet again to give a clear answer to the p5 1 generous incentives package the letter we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
1817164 iran has a clear choice engagement or isolation we regret that irans leaders appear to have chosen isolation if iran continues to refuse to come to the negotiating table the international pressure on iran will only grow
1817165 we regret that iran has once again chosen not to answer clearly despite all the efforts the six have made these past weeks to offer a framework for negotiations
1817166 we havent set any deadlines ourselves for their response and there is ongoing dialogue
1817167 certainly there is a matter which is going to be discussed by the ministers in september
1817168 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well

1817172 i would have the tendency to believe they were telling the truth a little bit more

1817178 there still is an enormous number of people in the party who are unhappy with clinton for what they perceive to be her vacillation on the war and her reluctance to confess error
1817179 people who care about these things remember when remember how remember who took leadership
1817180 shes one of the best known women in the world
1817181 shes been in the white house for eight years shes a senator from one of the largest states and 60 plus percent of the democratic party wants somebody else
1817182 if the debate is about changing politics and moving the country in a different direction and bringing people together we like our odds in that debate
1817183 if the debate is primarily about who is going to be a strong tough leader that debate quite frankly is probably going to benefit hillary clinton
1817184 were more interested in looking forward not in looking backward
1817185 when you talk about the broken politics of washington the people who are most affected by it are single women working moms
1817186 the liberal wing of the democratic party falls in love with quasi messianic figures who come along regularly with an exciting aspirational vision for where the country must go often coupled with an unpopular war at least an unpopular war among progressives and for a significant time they are ascendant within that liberal wing of the democratic party
1817187 when the broader cross section of the democratic party takes a somewhat more dispassionate look at the field and says who is ready to be president of the united states and bring the kind of vision and leadership to the job those quasi messianic figures tend to fall short and the more established candidate tends to win because people are looking for something rock solid and predictable when it comes to presidential voting

1817189 every flower and fruit is personally chosen and kept in barrels for 4 5 months blended with organic preservatives and honey to create to a rich product
1817190 this is not the case when the product is made from extracts where some content of the fruit may be lost
1817191 the main reason organic products are being recommended is that they are time tested a recent study by the us general accounting office suspects 125 chemicals found in cosmetics to be cancer causing some other ingredients may cause neurological disorders and birth effects thus these organic products are a better bet

1817202 they wont expand as much as they did with air in it so the tire pressure will be more constant
1817203 all the race cars use it because they want that tire pressure exactly where they want it and they want it to stay that way when they go around the track and the tire is hot
1817204 the original car manufacturers arent putting it in the tires the tire manufacturers themselves are not specifically recommending it for the tires

1817214 i kinda like them i thought about putting christmas lights on them
1817215 also at the same time to voice my point about the fence issue that i have had and also to stand and represent the farmer
1817216 but it is kind of an in your face i made my point im an easygoing guy ill take them down

1817222 i could drink this all day i wont but i could
1817223 weve been selling absinthe since it became legal in the u s in may of 2007 and it has been a great success right of the bat
1817224 there has been a lot of curiosity and excitement about obsello among our customers many of our customers are absinthe connoisseurs who had already tasted this brand overseas
1817225 we believe that the absinthe landscape will erode quickly if genuine high quality brands arent introduced soon
1817226 weve been on a 10 year quest for perfect authentic absinthe and have no doubt that our brand is better tasting and better in quality than any others available to consumers in the u s
1817227 this is a merger of equals in every sense of the word

1817249 the archdiocese of philadelphia did not have anything to do with that billboard
1817250 this person was very specific on where he wanted this billboard
1817251 he wanted it in the exact location of the other one
1817252 if there were one thing you would want to see for children in this neighborhood what would it be
1817253 how important do you think it is for fishtown to have its own community center
1817254 it should have a very clear mission and fund specific programs
1817255 we had a fantastic turnout i was pleased to see the opening attendance consist of people who have lived here their whole lives new residents and out of towners
1817256 there are so many galleries and restaurants opening up in our area its a great thing

1817259 but right now i have to concentrate on raising two babies and running whats already there but it will happen
1817260 the property was listed for sale and because of its location i realized that this space had potential to become proximity gallery i needed a location close to home because i would be taking care of our two sons eddie 19 months and max 7 weeks
1817261 after finishing school it was a goal of mine to open a space where local artists could showcase their work within the community
1817262 proximity gallery is a space for all artists to express themselves without concern for specific genre or medium
1817263 proximity gallery an orgasmic delicious psychotropic fantasy of the mind yeah awesome

1817265 surprise at the fact that canada has not asked to get that guy back
1817266 their parliamentarians are surprised at what the hell were doing they expect us to be better than that
1817267 they interpret it as going along with the bush administrations illegal process of prosecuting the war on terror and they are against it and thats what theyre trying to stymie
1817268 carbon sequestration is irresponsibly portrayed as an imminently useful option for solving the challenge
1817269 given the significant uncertainty on the date for completion of our proceeding after issuance of the stbs time limits decision and the fact that u s steel has read the stock purchase agreement to require that this transaction close by dec 31 cn contacted u s steel last week to formally request an extension of the deadline
1817270 us steel is prepared to co operate with cn towards the goal of closing the transaction in 2008 but it will not agree to extend the deal therefore we need a decision in this case and we have decided to seek legal relief to allow cn to close on the transaction prior to dec 31
1817271 the public interest calls for the stb to complete its review of the transaction and should it be approved to serve a decision that would allow the transaction to close by the end of the year
1817272 you know your a fat girl when you have all the same shirts just different colors

1817279 you can find out about smaller and often more interesting events around the city that other philly event sites miss
1817280 we really tried to find places to visit that were inexpensive but had flair we hope our show inspires people to venture out beyond what they know and try something new
1817281 philly is a huge city and sometimes we get so focused on our own neighborhoods we forget to go exploring the other sides of town uwishunu does a fantastic job highlighting all corners of the city
1817282 it points out what we sometimes dont realize about our own homes
1817283 when you live somewhere and you believe that what is around you is the norm its a surprise to see it from outside and see just how lucky you are
1817284 he told us he was an artist and wanted to open up a gallery
1817285 he put up metal grates on the windows and doors to protect his canvases there was never any problems from him
1817286 it was a major operation that was producing a large amount of marijuana
1817287 he was probably netting up to 4 000 per pound of marijuana
1817288 those semi automatics would cut right through these rowhouse walls and kill somebody
1817289 painstaking investigation led us to the conclusion that dr bruce e ivins was responsible for the death sickness and fear brought to our country by the 2001 anthrax mailing and that it appears based on the evidence that he was acting alone
1817290 the fbi sought out the best experts in the scientific community and over time for highly sensitive and specific tests were developed that were capable of detecting the unique qualities of the anthrax used in the 2001 attacks
1817291 based upon the totality of the evidence we had gathered against him we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
1817292 one of the largest and most complex in the history of law enforcement
1817293 penny wong and prime minister kevin rudd are set to join saddam hussein and the baathists of baghdad as only the second government in the world to have presided over the destruction of a ramsar listed wetland

1817297 i dont know why youre thinking im selling cirque du soleil to the world im not selling cirque du soleil im giving up 20 per cent of the company
1817298 we are dramatically ahead of the aggressive plans weve established
1817299 after careful review of the evidence we have determined that a reduction in rates is necessary at this time and a credit is due to cngs customers
1817300 it will be more important than ever to execute on our strategy to focus on the individual communities we serve by tailoring our offerings and strengthening our brand presence
1817301 our footprint could be between 60 and 65 per cent competitive by the end of the year if the markets open as they could
1817302 very clear and unambiguous insight into the relative order of importance and the technical factors we are going to evaluate
1817303 the first indication is that they are just going to go back and rewrite the rfp request for proposal to favor the large plane they chose
1817304 its one of these instances where youve got a few people whose testimony could mean the impeachment ostensibly of the president suskind explained
1817305 when this came up on msnbc moderator chuck todd asked politicos mike allen whether this would lead the anti war crowd in congress to call for impeachment allen replied that it would give the lefty blogosphere something to grab onto
1817306 and so in less time than it takes to say dick cheney the subject is changed from what would be one of the most outrageous violations of the constitution in the history of the republic to a left right issue
1817307 if the white house asked the cia to cook up this disinformation aimed at the american people why shouldnt the righty blogosphere too be up in arms why doesnt every american regardless of political party have a stake in the truth and the rule of law
1817308 i know i know thats not chuck todds or mike allens jobs unfortunately the closest that the msm usually comes to weighing the evidence is saying ron suskind charges x and the white house denies it this is what is now called reporting
1817309 promoters and participants in aggressive tax shelters should know that the irs will remain vigilant
1817310 oil prices continue to come down but its unclear what will happen with the prices
1817311 but at the same time u s citizens are making decisions that will carry forward regardless of how fuel prices fluctuate
1817312 we have seen a really dramatic change in buying patterns for different automobiles with big shifts away from suvs pickup trucks and other larger less fuel efficient cars for smaller cars for hybrids
1817313 and when people do that they are going to own that car for a number of years
1817314 we condemn in the strongest possible terms the mauritanian militarys overthrow of the democratically elected government of mauritania
1817315 we call on the military to release the president and the prime minister and to restore the legitimate constitutional democratically elected government immediately
1817316 you like getting your ass fucked real hard like that dont you baby
1817317 ill see you soon no i so enjoyed your show it was perfect i always like then to wait for your return
1817318 this process demonstrated that military commissions can effectively bring very dangerous terrorists to justice
1817319 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully
1817320 we discussed the strengthening of the close military and the security cooperation which benefit both countries and the region
1817321 we agreed to enhance the thai u s relation by focusing on education public health sciences security and law enforcement cooperation
1817322 thailands troops have helped the people of iraq and afghanistan as they battle extremists and strengthen their democracy and i want to thank you for those contributions mr prime minister
1817323 i want to thank you very much and congratulate the people of thailand for restoring its democracy
1817324 we dont know who was in and out of that house
1817325 in the face of a severe energy crisis the congress decides to go on a five week vacation
1817326 when im president of the united states i will call the congress back into session and tell them to act and not to leave town until they address this energy crisis and now is the time for action

1817328 we just want to celebrate hillarys accomplishments and what shes done for the country as a whole and women in particular
1817329 of the 13 people reported to be on board four suffered serious injuries nine are unaccounted for and are presumed to be fatally injured
1817330 whats remarkable this summer is the stability of this race
1817331 in a broad sense it is similar to previous elections
1817332 if everything is so good for barack obama why isnt everything so good for barack obama
1817333 i have the absolute right to be acquitted of these charges
1817334 the chinese governments decision to bar olympic gold medalist joey cheek from attending the olympics because of his advocacy for darfur is reprehensible
1817335 this action by beijings leaders is part of an orchestrated campaign to deny entry to individuals because of their political views beliefs writings association religion and ethnicity
1817336 because of their beliefs advocacy for the people of darfur and human rights in china and tibet
1817337 it is essential that president bush show leadership in promoting democracy freedom and human rights during his visit to china
1817338 of the 13 people reported to be on board four suffered serious injuries nine are unaccounted for and are presumed to be fatally injured
1817339 when poland signs a treaty with the united states on the deployment of missile defense elements then we will be in a position to discuss some additional aspects of military cooperation with belarus
1817340 we are confident dr ivins was the only person responsible
1817341 we believe we could have proven his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
1817342 in view of our special relations with china the president has decided to attend the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics
1817343 masaey is one of the few people who dared to speak publicly about how he was tortured in illegal detention by chechen officials and we are afraid hes paying a very high price for his courage
1817344 if president dimitry medvedev is truly committed to entrenching the rule of law across russia he needs to foster an environment in which victims of human rights abuses can speak up without fear including in chechnya
1817345 we just want to celebrate hillarys accomplishments and what shes done for the country as a whole and women in particular
1817346 in the face of a severe energy crisis the congress decides to go on a five week vacation
1817347 when im president of the united states i will call the congress back into session and tell them to act and not to leave town until they address this energy crisis and now is the time for action
1817348 our surge has succeeded in iraq militarily now we need an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and to create new ones
1817349 this isnt just a school issue its not just a city issue its also about families taking responsibility and providing them with awareness
1817350 the president has just been arrested by a commando who came to fetch him arrested him here and took him away
1817351 the airport is closed i think it will stay that way for a while until the new authorities get organised
1817352 the exemplary democratic advances which the country has made since the 2005 coup detat
1817353 assess the situation on the ground and to assist in promoting a peaceful solution to the crisis
1817354 these officers three generals refused to accept the presidential decree and are rebelling against the constitutional order
1817355 it affected my drumming seeing elvin jones with coltrane and how free he was says densmore
1817356 you know keep the beat but you can have a conversation if you like with the poet
1817357 i got sidetracked by this band jim morrison and crew and i couldnt help going down that road
1817358 if you just look at the main stage and say heres what the festival is about youre missing most of the festival
1817359 one of the things weve learned is that certain acts belong on certain stages you wouldnt put a chamber music ensemble in a football stadium were presenting more intimate acts and straight ahead bands in the rep were using the imax theater for the smith dobson stage because those bands need a quieter and more intimate space
1817360 people would say the musics over at 8 or 9 what do i do now
1817361 its a chance to show off what a great town san jose can be at night
1817362 weve got almost 1 000 volunteers and we want to keep this a community event were expecting 100 000 people so its pretty well attended if we spent a lot of money to get a big name act would it make the festival that much more enjoyable i dont know if it would
1817363 monterey and the san francisco jazz festival do that kind of thing really well were a very different event in a lot of ways
1817364 i have a vague feeling of dislike for him why is that
1817365 i think he had a couple fumbles in a game once
1817366 the alchemy index vols iii amp iv air amp earth
1817367 a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate
1817368 the total energy required for every bottles production transport and disposal is equivalent on average to filling that bottle a quarter of the way with oil
1817369 in developing world cities the majority of people dont have cars so i will say when you construct a good sidewalk you are constructing democracy a sidewalk is a symbol of equality the 20th century was a horrible detour in the evolution of the human habitat we were building much more for cars mobility than childrens happiness
1817370 cutting 70 million in fluff out of the city budget
1817371 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1817372 we fully intend to move forward with additional prosecutions on the 20 other cases that are currently in the military commission system
1817373 this military commission finds you on charge number one conspiracy not guilty of charge two material support for terrorism guilty
1817374 is material support a war crime the defence believes it is not
1817375 a good outcome for the government in arguing that this was a fair trial
1817376 the fourth factor the ability of the defence to mount a full defence is where the criticism of the process likely will be levied
1817377 the verdict was in long before the jury began to deliberate
1817378 we have found a biologic relation between cll phenotype monoblastic b cell lymphocytosis and cll
1817379 the majority of deaths in persons with cll phenotype mbl are due to unrelated causes but progressive disease requiring chemotherapy will develop in a clinically significant proportion of subjects presenting with lymphocytosis
1817380 it is not known whether cll phenotype mbl is associated with any of the characteristic abnormalities of cll such as the 13q14 deletion or biased usage of specific immunoglobulin heavy variable group ighv genes
1817381 further define a new premalignant condition and favor the view that there is a continuous production of cll cells in at least 5 of normal adults however since the incidence of monoblastic b cell lymphocytosis is 100 times higher than the incidence of cll it stands to reason that in most people with mbl full blown cll will never emerge
1817382 in the absence of progression studies to define the mutational profile of igvh genes and of chromosomes are not justified for patients with this indolent condition
1817383 france expresses its disappointment at the lack of a clear response to the proposals for a double freeze in order to launch negotiations
1817384 france will continue to hope that iranian authorities will soon give an expected answer and will not chose isolation
1817385 a linux operating system that scores high marks on usability and the cool factor
1817386 offer a glimpse of the ripe market opportunity for linux based desktops to proliferate
1817387 it probably wasnt the most opportune time for these athletes to wear these masks
1817388 they have the right to wear masks if they feel its in their best interest to do so hopefully they wont have to use them and the air quality will be good
1817389 i guess the best way to put it is if theres an announcement wednesday id be as surprised as anybody else
1817390 why do you call me lord lord and not do what i tell you every one who comes to me and hears my words and does them i will show you what he is like he is like a man building a house who dug deep and laid the foundation upon rock and when the flood arose the stream broke against that house and could not shake it because it has been well built but he who hears and does not do them is ike a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation against which the stream broke and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great
1817391 has been awarded the 2005 national medal of arts of the united states the grand prix du disque of the charles cros academy and the edison award of the netherlands and was elected an honorary member of the royal academy of music in britain he has received several honorary doctoral degrees and a variety of other recognitions from brandeis university brown university columbia university denison university haverford college johns hopkins university the manhattan school of music new york university princeton university the university of miami southern methodist university smu and yale university
1817392 i figured once they gave me a visa i wouldnt imagine they wouldnt allow me to come in later that was a big shock i wasnt expecting to get a call the evening before i was leaving for beijing
1817393 out of these 14 are first officers and the rest expatriate commanders with thousands of hours on boeing 737
1817394 we have revised our current schedule which requires less manpower in the cockpit based on this we have initiated talks with trainee first officers to guide and facilitate suitable employment in an alternative organization
1817395 unlike india pilots expat pilots have their own individual contracts some work for a month others for three months etc and so we cannot give a number what i can say though is that we have the same number of expatriates that we had in the end of july but we wont be adding more
1817396 on march 2003 we send you the notice to appear for finger print
1817397 monthly releases straight into the living room were happy to be working with the chapmans and nintendo to make it a reality
1817398 call upon all our supporters and members and any organs and structures under the direction and control of our respective parties to stop and desist the perpetration of violence in any form
1817399 its about the things that i think about the books and films referenced in the game made big impacts on me at various stages in my life
1817400 super mario bros provided the core game mechanic that braid and so many other games are based on so it only seemed appropriate to reference it i wanted to take that childlike optimistic simple world blue sky feeling of super mario bros and mature it into a world that is emotionally complex lacking in certitude and possessing an existential gravitas
1817401 we havent examined the aircraft yet weve never had a copter go down due to firefighting efforts
1817402 what theyre going to do is get the free cash free permits compensation from the federal government theyre not going to give the consumer the discount for that theyre simply going to accept the full carbon price and even extract more money from the consumer so its a double rip off
1817403 theres absolutely no discount being offered we think its a crook deal
1817404 this is not about what costs might or might not be passed onto retail consumers
1817405 on diverse occasions between 1996 and november of 2001 hamdan drove or accompanied osama bin laden to various al qaeda sponsored training camps press conferences or lectures
1817406 delivered weapons ammunition or other supplies to al qaeda members and associates
1817407 he wasnt trying to stop any cars but he was just driving down the roadway and has police all over his vehicle
1817408 it makes us look bad if theyre flying down the roadway cutting in and out of traffic
1817409 people are going to call and complain were running them off the roadway
1817410 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
1817411 certain genetic mutations identical to the anthrax used in the attacks
1817412 afforded all of the equipment and containment facilities which would have been needed to prepare the anthrax letters used in the fall 2001 attacks
1817413 provide no legitimate reason for the extended work hours other than home was not good and that he went to the laboratory to escape from his home life
1817414 i wouldnt necessarily make the conclusion that just because he had access to a lyophilizer and used a lyophilizer that that provides a smoking gun that he must be using this for sinister purposes
1817415 i think the public and the survivors of the anthrax attacks are entitled to see the evidence before the grand jury
1817416 and if there was a draft indictment and they were ready to indict mr ivins they ought to see that as well
1817417 in an ideal world there would be lawn signs and cross street rivalry
1817418 for legal and practical purposes freeman and colley lee have been separated since december of 2007
1817419 he said that she had offered him a ride home that they were friends and she had offered him a ride home and she didnt really know the way and so he was going to drive the vehicle
1817420 when people become so blinded by ideology they commit crimes that trample the rights of their neighbors and put lives in danger the fbi must act
1817421 we hope this reward serves as an incentive to take the often difficult step of bringing important information to the attention of law enforcement
1817422 the whole idea of domestic terrorism is definitely a high priority especially in a case like this where lives were placed in danger
1817423 we hope to glean enough from the video to determine how many people are involved and their basic descriptions to corroborate some leads we have gotten up to today
1817424 we know where you work we know where you live
1817425 that single contribution is more than the rewards we usually offer
1817426 it is gratifying to see the support for identifying and apprehending those responsible for these acts the campus community is encouraged by the seriousness of the response to these acts and the support being shown by law enforcement agencies individuals and the humane society in acting quickly to encourage people with information to step forward
1817427 we wanted to let people know that if you care about the protection of animals you have to care about the protection of people as well
1817428 anyone who would commit these types of horrible crimes is completely at odds with the core principle of the humane movement
1817429 obviously intended to protect people which is a worthy and admirable goal
1817430 the courts are moving to the position where government can fund religious activities and endorse religion without restraint
1817431 theres quite a powerful trend here in the courts to take the supreme courts decision and really run with it
1817432 i have not yet seen one case where people have brought up this standing issue where the government has lost and the taxpayers have won every single one has been thrown out this is really quite significant

1817436 im ashamed to say that there were folks even in the medical department who said over my dead body will american civilians see this
1817437 the average joe surgeon civilian or military has never seen this stuff
1817438 yeah theyve seen guys shot in the chest but the kind of ferocious blast burn and penetrating trauma thats part of the modern i e d wound is like nothing theyve seen even in a manhattan emergency room its a shocking heart stopping eye opening kind of thing and they need to see this on the plane before they get there because theres a learning curve to this
1817439 you do that you end up with a highly diluted cold patient with no clotting factors and the high pressure restarts bleeding
1817440 in the past people said oh army surgeons are like butchers theyre not research oriented this shows how skillful they are

1817447 barack obama has said no to more domestic exploration of oil and natural gas he has said no to new coal fired electrical generation plants he has said no to nuclear
1817448 john mccain is for clean coal technology which will create jobs barack obama is not he is turning his back on the state of ohio on the fact that there are jobs that could be created with clean coal technology and its something he has rejected
1817449 develop and deploy clean coal technology obama will significantly increase the resources devoted to the commercialization and deployment of low carbon coal technologies obama will consider whatever policy tools are necessary including standards that ban new traditional coal facilities to ensure that we move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
1817450 our candidate has a plan whereas in contrast to barack obama where there really isnt a plan until very recently it seems to me that barack obama is only responding right now to somebody who showed the leadership on the energy issue from the very start of the campaign
1817451 obama has said he would go along with a compromise but going along is what got us here to begin with
1817452 the senator has a comprehensive approach and he has a track record of not voting for things that did not solve the problem theres a history in the u s congress of having a one year production tax credit which doesnt make any policy sense these are long term investment decisions you need a credit thats permanent
1817453 require that we rationalize the current patchwork of temporary tax credits
1817454 im not one who believes that we need to subsidize things the wind industry is doing fine the solar industry is doing fine
1817455 the us government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behavior in scapegoating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq in order to distract attention from the sources of us failures in that country
1817456 during the recent operations in basra sadr city and maysan iraqi troops uncovered convincing evidence that iranian lethal aid has continued to flow into iraq

1817470 before recording technology existed you could not separate music from its social context
1817471 he then proceeds to share six possible music distribution models including the varying artist opportunity problems and control that stems from each
1817472 so in the data she cites the head of the online music market represents 32 of the all plays and the tail represents 68 thats certainly no challenge to the long tail theory indeed its even more tail heavy than the data i cited in my book probably because i used a more generous estimate of 50 000 tracks for inventory
1817473 the web is clearly changing cultural consumption patterns but those changes dont seem to involve the sort of drastic flattening of demand curves predicted by the long tail
1817474 1 if the goal is to cater to your heavy customers broaden your assortment with more niche products 2 strictly manage the costs of offering products that will rarely sell if possible use online networks to construct creative models in which you incur no costs unless the customer actually initiates a transaction
1817475 in light of developments since the withdrawal of the microsoft proposal to acquire yahoo
1817476 why would such a complicated transaction just yahoo search with all the headaches and all be in the cards for microsoft after the failed bid for 40 plus billion for all of yahoo microsoft s intentions are clear buy the search business from yahoo and take that team and go spend at least 20 billion for facebook integrating the search team at yahoo with facebook puts a formidable army to take on google
1817477 microsofts intentions are clear go spend at least 20 billion for facebook
1817478 google is locked out of the web that soon will be owned by microsoft we will never get an open web back if these two deals happen it s facebook and microsoft vs the open public web
1817479 according to an interesting rumour making the rounds microsoft is to acquire yahoos search business as well as facebook and lock both down to better take on google microsoft is trying to shift from open to closed that s what evil really means coercing others into accepting value destruction mark zuckerberg and steve ballmer s hare brained scheme for world domination microsofts move is a textbook example of how not to think strategically at the edge
1817480 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury

1817490 this is one of several major medical fraud investigations that are ongoing
1817491 theres too much money being illegally stripped from public health care programs and the potential impact to those with a legitimate need is too great to let such fraud escape federal prosecution

1817495 she said theres a woman on the jury whos quite a bully this womans already decided that hes guilty and that we should go out and see why
1817496 oh yes i heard some of them mentioning that in the jury room
1817497 i conclude from this evidence that there was talk in the jury room about a private visit to watsons bay
1817498 i think that the caller was a member of the jury
1817499 the evidence shows that one or more jurors probably misconducted themselves but as i have explained i am unable to identify any such juror

1817502 we thought we would end the series with a light fun romantic comedy that is sure to entertain and delight our audiences
1817503 it has been a hit at festivals around the country and in its over seas release
1817504 ty liebermans script struck me as having the makings of a really fun romantic comedy i immediately loved the premise of the wedding movie with a twist
1817505 the situation in which these characters find themselves was compelling on the verge of marriage our groom must choose between his fianc e and his first love
1817506 i felt there was a delightful paradox in the fact that his first love was a man it is both crucial to the story and yet incidental this could happen to anyone thematically i liked how the screenplay took sexual identity out for a spin
1817507 think my best friends wedding with a sexual twist and you get the picture
1817508 the film is a lot of fun and a lot of laughs and our audience is on the guest list of a very funny wedding

1817515 a close scrutiny of the certificate issued by dr nayanaben patel in whose clinic at anand in gujarat the surrogate mother delivered the japanese girl has revealed that while ikufumi donated his sperms the eggs were not given by yuki the embryo was transferred to the surrogate mother pritiben mehta who delivered the baby girl on july 25
1817516 but there can be foolproof evidence only after the dna tests of both ikufumi and yuki are conducted this would prove beyond doubt the parentage of the child it seems after the divorce yuki did not bother to come to india to see the child because her eggs were not used

1817529 they keep saying where these vehicles are supposed to be used and not used and i believe that has a huge influence on what the provinces are allowing
1817530 so dont just say that these vehicles are not viable especially given the fact that they are viable in every other market in the world except canada
1817531 if the government is not happy with the federal standards for low speed vehicles then change it
1817532 low speed vehicles are designed for low speed operating environments and mix with traffic safely and have a vital place in our urban mix

1817555 het boek klimaatactivist in de politiek heb ik geschreven vanuit grote zorg om de klimaatverandering en het gebrek aan politieke actie om daar tegen op te treden in het boek analyseer ik ook welke maatschappelijke beweging er nodig is om tot een afdoende aanpak te komen ik blik daarbij ook terug op mijn eigen actieverleden en leg daarover uitgebreid verantwoording af ik vind dat ook de plicht van een politicus ik heb dat ook al eerder op verschillende manieren gedaan ik trek in het boek uitgebreid lering uit acties waar ik eerder aan heb meegedaan zoals de inbraak bij het ministerie van ez ik beschrijf daarbij waarom ik tot het inzicht ben gekomen dat acties zich moeten richten op de parlementaire besluitvorming en binnen de grenzen van de wet moeten blijven daarmee neem ik afstand van de actiemiddelen van 23 jaar geleden en spreek daarover een negatief oordeel uit ik geef aan waarom ik heb gekozen voor de parlementaire politiek om de klimaatcrisis aan te pakken de keuzes die ik twintig jaar geleden maakte zijn op geen enkele manier meer de keuzes die ik nu zou maken willen we de klimaatcrisis effectief aanpakken dat zijn politici met lef nodig die de noodzakelijke maatregelen nemen en is er een zeer brede en open maatschappelijke beweging onontbeerlijk waar zeer zeer velen zich in herkennen en aan kunnen bijdragen

1817564 we needed a central location updated facilities and plenty of space requirements that were completely met by this locale
1817565 i was worried when i first heard that they were moving
1817566 i was afraid id have to get a new doctor ive been seeing dr hurowitz for a long time and hes been excellent but its all of the same staff so im happy
1817567 sure i remember back when it was st marys hospital and of course as neumann medical center and this just looks incredible they did a really nice job at making this a beautiful and spacey office
1817568 if youve been to the old offices you know how crowded it was in there the fact that they have specialists in house makes it a lot easier to get any appointments that you need in one place and during one trip
1817569 we were able to take our years of experience at the previous location and say i dont like this or that and then go to the drawing board to improve on them for the new location this facility will be the model for other temple physician offices in philadelphia
1817570 while we do have a high number of locations each of which is extremely community and patient oriented
1817571 these are doctors who have been with us and worked together for quite some time

1817577 there is not a scintilla of evidence that would indicate that dr hatfill had anything to do with this
1817578 hamdans trial violated two of the most fundamental criminal justice principles accepted by all developed nations
1817579 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values the rules for the guant namo military commissions are so flawed that justice could never be served from start to finish this has been a monumental debacle of american justice the judgment against hamdan undoubtedly will be challenged in legitimate courts but there is no appeal from the judgment of future generations this system was devised to permit the prosecution of alleged wrongdoing by detainees while continuing to cover up the wrongdoing by government interrogators trials that are shrouded in secrecy and tainted by coercion are the very antithesis of american justice
1817580 in the strange world of guant namo justice even if hamdan had been acquitted on all charges he would have been detained indefinitely nowhere else in the u s justice system can someone be held for life regardless of whether he is convicted or acquitted of a crime todays outcome represents nothing more than an illusion of justice it is time to shut down these commissions and put an end to this shameful chapter in american history

1817583 this critical line of credit and funding for advanced batteries would not only create good paying jobs but would help an industry racing to create the next generation of automobiles that will free us from our dependence on foreign oil
1817584 at a time when the credit crisis and rising gasoline and energy costs continue to plague our economy this investment cant come soon enough
1817585 i believe it is critical that the federal government provide assistance for retooling our existing manufacturing facilities and for the development of the advanced battery technologies that will be required to support plug in hybrids and other advanced vehicle technologies
1817586 the reality is that our domestic auto manufacturers are competing against foreign countries not just foreign companies and this federal funding would start to reverse that trend and help to decrease our dependence on foreign oil
1817587 the ultimate implications of dpi depend largely on both how it is implemented and the purposes for which it is used

1817613 a new report says the conservative governments stable funding program for the canadian military is already in shambles only months after it was released the senate security and defence committee released a study wednesday that suggests
1817614 the bank of canada has come out just in the past week and announced that inflation is going to be at four per cent which puts the canadian military in the hole by 2 5 per cent
1817615 we have men and women in harms way and the government is trying to do this on the cheap
1817616 defence spending went up by 1 3 billion in this years federal budget and now sits at slightly more than 18 billion annually but the main gauge of how much a country spends on its military is usually measured as a percentage of its gross domestic product not dollars canada currently spends almost 1 2 per cent of its gdp on defence while the average for most nato countries is two per cent the senate committee has projections that show the countrys defence spending will actually decline over the next 20 years under the tory plan dropping to 0 79 per cent of gdp even if the canadian economy stays robust

1817632 the meeting felt it was imperative that communalisation of the situation should be prevented at all costs as this would adversely impact on the secular fabric of the nation
1817633 leaders of all parties present agreed that the situation was serious and that immediate remedial action was called for
1817634 there was unanimity among all those present that the first step was the restoration of peace and normalcy

1817639 one of the things i really like about his writing is that you can hear hes drawing from a lot of different musical traditions but he manages to make them work together in a very interesting way
1817640 it has a relevant contemporary sound but it always feels accessible
1817641 the way people are introduced to her in freshman english they tend to put her in a certain box being meek and mild talking to the flowers insects and birds

1817744 they keep saying where these vehicles are supposed to be used and not used and i believe that has a huge influence on what the provinces are allowing
1817745 so dont just say that these vehicles are not viable especially given the fact that they are viable in every other market in the world except canada
1817746 if the government is not happy with the federal standards for low speed vehicles then change it
1817747 low speed vehicles are designed for low speed operating environments and mix with traffic safely and have a vital place in our urban mix

1817751 this is an excellent example of the innovative ways in which we keep elvis catalog fresh for new and existing fans

1817755 i dont really like fooling around with things like that all the elvis recordings are so good it kind of bothers me
1817756 some people get all upset if they mess with a classic but if you take a classic like a little less conversation i vaguely remembered that song until they redid it and now i adore it
1817757 this outcome was pre determined not by the court but by the government well before the trial even began
1817758 the travesty of this is that mr hamdan should have been acquitted of all charges
1817759 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully
1817760 we can only trust that the next subjects will include cooks tailors and cobblers without whose support terrorist leaders would be left unfed unclothed and unshod and therefore rendered incapable of planning or executing their attacks

1817776 what alternatives are you considering as a result of high gas prices affecting your commute to work
1817777 in a time of economic uncertainty it is surprising to see how many professionals are considering making a career move due to high gas prices

1817785 a rigorous test drive and a thorough inspection done by an ase certified automotive technician are the best ways to make sure the used vehicle you are considering buying is in good condition
1817786 unless you have experience repairing vehicles its probably a good idea to have the vehicle inspected by your regular automotive technician
1817787 spending a little bit of money to learn about a vehicles history and find out its current mechanical state will help you make an educated decision about your used vehicle purchase
1817788 during the second quarter we made continued progress in sustaining year over year revenue growth and in approaching profitability

1817790 we are proud that moodys has upgraded the city and county of san franciscos bond rating
1817791 this rating is a statement about the strong fiscal health of san francisco but we must remain steadfast in our commitment to financial prudence and sound managerial practices in order to continue our terrific progress
1817792 among san franciscos strengths were an above average resident socioeconomic profile a highly diverse and robust revenue base an exceptionally strong balance sheet at close of fiscal year 2006 2007 and a moderate debt burden with relatively rapid direct debt retirement
1817793 pfizers decision to locate their biotherapeutics and bioinnovation center in mission bay is a significant win for san francisco and is a clear indication that mission bay is one of the nations premier life science centers
1817794 san francisco offers companies like pfizer a world class urban innovation district anchored by the nations pre eminent biomedical university and unparalleled opportunities for collaboration and access to the very best talent that the united states and the world have to offer
1817795 this move to be next door to u c s f s mission bay campus will position pfizers biotherapeutics and bioinnovation center for success in the aggressive pursuit of the most exciting and innovative science and the recruitment of the very best scientists
1817796 mission bay presents a unique opportunity for our entrepreneurial organization to collaborate with world class biomedical scientists and biotech organizations in a campus type setting which allows researchers to easily mingle exchange ideas and collaborate
1817797 we are already on pace to exceed the goal of a 7 reduction in greenhouse gases set by the kyoto protocol
1817798 with the aggressive policies and initiatives being put forth by my administration we can continue to move towards our goal of 20 reduction by 2012
1817799 san franciscos community inventory methodology goes above and beyond most current community inventories in the united states these efforts are impressive given the inherent complexities and challenges in producing a community wide inventory and the lack of a widely accepted and standard community wide inventory protocol
1817800 today we recognize san francisco as a true leader and innovator on climate protection and part of an elite group of cities driving action and inspiring others
1817801 from green building standards and their commitment to recycling and waste reduction san francisco illustrates the power of a local government to proactively address global warming while enhancing the community

1817828 ultimately i believe that a deal is a deal i received what i bargained for and our outstanding attorneys should receive what they bargained for as well
1817829 although i approved the settlements i did so without being aware of the considerations that now impel me to disapprove them
1817830 the wounds of 9 11 will not easily be assuaged
1817831 but neither should they be exacerbated by rich rewards of fees and benign indifference to unreasonably large awards
1817832 incomprehensible that the administration apparently intends to seek or accept an exemption from the nuclear suppliers group guidelines for india with few or none of the conditions

1817887 they didnt have any gas to get here but also we discovered they had no electricity in their home

1817889 three days later they shut down because they werent doing enough business

1817891 we are seeing more life stories that are really life threatening
1817892 whenever i saw the story about michele whitaker coming back and wasnt dead after all these years that she was supposed to be dead and murdered by my son that angered me
1817893 there is no way that he was physically capable of doing that crime my son is innocent he was the most loving caring child probably that you could ever imagine he never had a mean bone in his body that i knew of anyway and i raised him i was his mother i nurtured him he was a good child he was never in any trouble whatsoever never
1817894 why do you want to compound this and put this on my son when you dont even have anyone to prove that theyre dead or anything
1817895 thats what angers me and then you proclaim that my son is a serial killer
1817896 my sons not a serial killer and my son has took the rap for this i think im owed quite an apology for all this being aired on national tv for people to see this this is so wrong this is so upsetting to me
1817897 im overwhelmed with joy not just for the fact that my son is not going to be accused of her murder anymore but the fact that shes a person and shes not been killed
1817898 im very happy but im very angry with her mother
1817899 you dont make accusations about things like that and accuse people of things unless you have the proof and the evidence you need evidence first not just what you personally think
1817900 i pray and this is a really bad prayer that i know i shouldnt say this but i pray her mother has to suffer the consequences even more for her actions for what she has accused my son of doing i hope that the future for her is long and hard even worse than the six years her daughter was missing to accuse of my son of such a crime

1817938 what is reality i think the origins of any fiction film has to be something real documentary film does not exist the moment a director makes one simple move with the camera or joins to different clips together he has made a choice whether its label is fiction or documentary

1817972 ive always been in favor of this bill and believe that our downstate suburban workforce housing initiative will be a much needed supplement to give us the type of numbers we need to make a dent in our affordable housing crisis
1817973 the bill is good conceptually and it is a good message that were sending though we must remember that most towns have already implemented a 10 percent to 20 percent threshold for affordable housing
1817974 i dont think it would be a good idea to have pension obligations similarly passed around

1817998 antreprenorii romani au o parere foarte buna despre afacerile lor si tin la pret
1817999 in romania nu avem un bazin foarte mare din care sa alegem companiile de exemplu intr un judet numarul de companii cu cifra de afaceri de peste 20 de milioane de euro este foarte mic de ordinul trei din zece
1818000 de multe ori ne lovim de alte fonduri de private equity in cautare la fel ca noi de proiecte cu potential de foarte multe ori mi s a intamplat sa mi se spuna de catre antreprenori ca au mai fost contactati inainte de alte fonduri sau ca dupa noi au mai intrebat si alte fonduri
1818001 n as putea spune ca proiectele romanesti au fost extraordinar de profitabile antreprenorii romani au o parere foarte buna despre afacerile lor si tin foarte mult la pret uneori am ales sa investim in cehia sau slovacia din cauza pretului prea ridicat cerut de antreprenorii romani
1818002 companiile au cicluri de crestere si descrestere e usor atunci cand pornesti de la zero sa iti dublezi afacerile in trei ani cresterea devine mai dificila insa dupa ce compania a atins un anumit prag de maturitate atunci entuziasmul nu mai este de ajuns ci este nevoie de un management profesionist si infuzii de capital
1818003 pentru ca pachetele pe care le pot oferi managerilor sunt aproape imposibil de batut in piata
1818004 faptul ca managerul primeste o data la patru sau cinci ani un bonus care poate urca pana la cateva milioane de euro nu poate fi egalat de nicio corporatie

1818034 productivitate si competitivitate aceasta este esenta programului de guvernare al pd l cuvintele suna abstract cum spuneti dar asta i batalia nu poti ajunge din urma uniunea europeana cu o tara net importator de produse agricole in loc sa beneficiem de actuala criza alimentara noi suferim din plin aceasta criza ne am propus ca in patru ani sa rasturnam acest deficit si sa facem din romania un exportator net de produse agricole
1818035 este de asemenea nevoie de o reforma a pietei pamantului adica de stimularea gruparii terenurilor pe care sa fie constituite ferme care sa produca pentru piata avem in program structurarea agriculturii pe zone legumicultura in anumite zone la fel pomicultura sau viticultura
1818036 iesirea pe pietele externe cu produse cu valoare adaugata mare este esentiala romania nu are acum posibilitatea sa si faca reclama in afara dar daca agricultura va fi restucturata pe lanturi de producatori si cu un ajutor de promovare important transformarea agriculturii romanesti intr un exportator net este posibila
1818037 programul nostru este eminamente de dreapta nu va fi in functie de ce ne mai da guvernul ci va stimula productivitatea si competitivitatea vom avea un buget pe patru ani dar nu pot detalia in stadiul acesta al discutiei in orice caz nu va fi un program de tip psd
1818038 de asemenea descentralizarea trebuie dusa pana la capat uitati va la inundatiile de acum de ce trebuie sa astepte judetele ajutor de la guvern si sa stea cu mana intinsa nu de ajutor au nevoie problema este de a descentraliza administratia si de a lasa finantarea la nivel local vom urgenta descentralizarea administratiei publice pentru ca este absurd ca intr o vreme in care vorbim de facturi online sa vedem in continuare oameni tinuti zile in sir in fata ghiseelor pentru a obtine o autorizatie

1818059 am avut trei ani in care fondurile pentru sustinerea programului de investitii au fost suficiente atat prin majorarea de capital pe care omv a realizat o in momentul privatizarii petrom majorare de 800 de milioane de euro cat si prin cash flow ul generat de activitatile noastre acum aceste surse nu mai sunt suficiente in conditiile in care ne am propus sa realizam anual investitii de 1 5 miliarde de euro in perioada 2008 2010
1818060 suntem in discutii cu un club de banci format din peste cinci institutii financiare internationale dar care au activitati si in romania pentru contractarea unui credit de pana la 500 de milioane de euro pentru sustinerea programului de investitii speram ca intr o luna sa finalizam aceste discutii am luat in considerare riscurile pe care le include o finantare intr o tara emergenta dar totusi imprumutul va fi realizat pe piata locala in numele petrom
1818061 aceasta este suma pe care o puteam ridica de pe piata locala luand in considerare situatia financiara a petrom in momentul in care vom contracta acest credit vom vedea un impact asupra rezultatului financiar dar deocamdata nu cred ca avem nevoie de produse de hedging pentru a ne proteja de eventualele riscuri de piata oricum daca va fi necesara abordarea unor astfel de masuri acestea se vor face la nivel de grup de catre omv actionarul majoritar
1818062 volatilitatea va continua dar noi vom ramane in continuare foarte atenti la orice posibilitate pe care ne o ofera piata externa pe segmentul de explorare si productie si pe partea de retail pe pietele externe pe care suntem prezenti ne gandim la optimizarea retelei care ar putea duce la cresterea numarului de statii fie prin investitii greenfield fie prin achizitii dar deocamdata nu avem o decizie concreta luata in acest sens
1818063 petrom este in continuare compania petroliera din ece cu cel mai ridicat potential de crestere care va fi realizat dupa finalizarea modernizarii rezultatele ne au aratat insa ca procesul de modernizare este departe de a fi gata si nici chiar actualele preturi ridicate ale petrolului nu feresc petrom de probleme
1818064 petrom a raportat pierderi operationale de 74 de milioane de lei pe segmentul de rafinare si marketing ceea ce nu este deloc rau ne asteptam ca rezultatul din rafinare al petrom sa devina pozitiv abia dupa retehnologizarea rafinariei petrobrazi
1818065 la inceputul lunii iunie a fost finalizata modernizarea fabricii de ciment din campulung modernizare care aduce o crestere a capacitatii de productie a holcim romania cu aproximativ 30 dar si o reorganizare si redimensionare a fabricii cu efect direct asupra numarului de angajati

1818068 i really appreciate jeff moorad and tom garfinkel co owners of hall of fame racing for giving me this opportunity
1818069 i have really enjoyed my time testing with the people on the team and im looking forward to having a successful weekend at michigan in the dlp hdtv toyota and helping hall of fame racing finish out the season as strong as possible
1818070 all our dreams can come true if we have the courage
1818071 when the next generation looks at the middle east on the map they should be able to say what an interesting place not we depend on them for our economic security
1818072 nancy pelosi said she wants to save the planet she repeated it i want to save the planet she had to convince herself
1818073 if the world will end i would go to the netherlands because everything happens there 50 years later
1818074 i informed this person that i could not in good conscious divulge that information
1818075 the corporation should be able to track what employees are doing on its computers
1818076 an employee must give up his password to his supervisor on request
1818077 i informed this person that i could not in good conscious divulge that information all new accounts are forced password changes at first login and every x days afterwards even if i had it
1818078 im sorry i only have the authority to override a password even i cant see what the current one is youll have to ask your people for their passwords if you want them
1818079 dont worry problem solved lockout wont be happening with this forced rebooting thingy and itll be better once we get the software manufacturer solution so everythings fixed
1818080 you still want the passwords well start loop with 1
1818081 users are changing those all the time now thanks to the new prompts i cant hardly keep up
1818082 i think thats likely to create more of a security hazard than its worth
1818083 of course if you insist on it i will have to tell everyone that we have their passwords also in the spirit of full disclosure i just want to caution you that those of us in it will be able to tell each time those passwords are used by someone else again i think this is more trouble than its worth unless theres a problem youre not telling me about
1818084 there is no valid business reason why you would need these passwords if you have a specific need for information or you need people logged off let me know and i can provide those services for you without divulging passwords
1818085 its a great opportunity and im really looking forward to the challenge
1818086 most of the planning is set in place although i have missed the first squad camps as i had other cricket things on at the time
1818087 gra z z bi gdzie potw r wyskakuje z okna do pokoju
1818088 i just want to get back into cricket and on a personal level id love to go
1818089 its a tricky one ive been briefed a little bit and the report says it cannot guarantee the players safety
1818090 i guess there is a bit more responsibility but its been good and probably helps my cricket keeping me focused
1818091 theres been only a couple of 30s and a 20 so im looking to do better in the final
1818092 its not that they are unacceptable consent forms theyre just acceptable for only certain kinds of research
1818093 without looking at the original consent forms i dont think you can say you can use them for any type of research
1818094 it doesnt make sense to fund or not fund research just because of when a stem cell line was derived
1818095 its preferable to use cell lines that have even better consent than ones used on the bush approved registry
1818096 an important step for us is to take into account these findings
1818097 improving web services security scenarios and implementation guidance for wcf
1818098 very cool and extremely useful i cant say enough good things about this its an amazing work
1818099 awesome phreaking colossal the content is unique there is no match of it very timely just as wcf becomes mainstream with my customers
1818100 emigrating from poor rural life in central america to poor urban and suburban life
1818101 far from family support networks and often sharing quarters with other men tend to drink too much beer and high sugar energy beverages
1818102 in the first 10 years after immigrating people gain an average of 12 pounds
1818103 they arrive blind to american culture and with little knowledge about health care they work around the clock and neglect themselves they live a sedentary life and eat food that is too rich i tell them to go back to what they ate at home rice and lentils and fruits to recover what they have lost
1818104 tintim mai ales turismul de afaceri si avem deja rezervari atat pentru cazare cat si pentru evenimente
1818105 to keep medicare solvent we need to promote competition and consumer choice as we have with the medicare advantage program and the medicare part d prescription drug program
1818106 have risen even faster than overall nationwide health care costs much faster
1818107 soon the baby boomers will retire which will sharply reduce the number of workers supporting each beneficiary
1818108 competition among plans has contributed to the medicare part d programs success in reducing costs nearly 40 relative to the original estimates of the cost of a medicare drug benefit
1818109 congress just axed a promising program to replace government mandated pricing with competitive bidding
1818110 continued congressional inertia will only impose crushing obligations on our children and grandchildren and undermine our countrys economic viability in a global economy
1818111 plague has long been the single biggest health issue in poor black communities
1818112 speak out on the crisis and spell out just what they will do about it
1818113 have given countless speeches on the terrorism fight the iraq war the iran missile threat immigration the housing and banking crisis a tanking economy and affordable health care
1818114 as devastating as these problems are to many families they do not pile up bodies and wreak catastrophic havoc on entire sectors of the population mostly poor black communities
1818115 hiv aids is not even mentioned as an item in the detailed health care plan on
1818116 in a campaign position paper obama has said he will push for more funds for aids treatment education and testing but much of his emphasis has been on african nations
1818117 even if mccain had boned up on the aids crisis and laid out a plan to confront the crisis and obama had fleshed out more details about confronting the crisis in african american communities its still no substitute for speaking out on the campaign trail about the crisis and pushing government health agencies and private donors to do more to combat the aids plague
1818118 we have found a dictionary of genes critical to a viral infection using these techniques this can be done with any virus

1818122 people will think its ok not to use condoms anymore
1818123 tempered by worries that circumcision may face a backlash on cultural religious or sexual grounds and may prompt men to abandon use of the condom
1818124 we found that there was no difference between the circumcised men and uncircumcised men that there is no increase in sexual dysfunction in circumcised men and in fact circumcised men did report greater penile sensitivity after circumcision
1818125 this is a call to action to call for male circumcision its been two years and still there is not enough money focus to scale up effort and more needs to be done
1818126 there is no national male circumcision campaign to promote it more education is needed
1818127 it is the first time i know of that a pregnant womans body has been equated to a meth lab
1818128 i hate to see a young mother put in prison away from her child
1818129 i f she could be put in a treatment program with her children that would be the best course maybe we need to revisit the legislation
1818130 this is an opportunity to get treatment and assistance to a mother whose addiction is so bad she has chosen to take illegal drugs while carrying a child
1818131 antreprenorii romani au o parere foarte buna despre afacerile lor si tin la pret
1818132 in conditiile actuale este improbabil ca sa primim pana la sfarsitul anului in curs suma de 442 milioane euro stabilita in amendamentul la contractul din 2006

1818134 its a damn shame thats all there is to it
1818135 we know were missing out on a quality experience for the student athletes but its too big a load to bear
1818136 all the benefits inherent with the conference situation were not enough for us to forget about the travel costs
1818137 there is no room for divorce we cant get into priuses or onto buses and solve our problems
1818138 airlines dont have marketing people now so were dealing with some 800 number or getting some group desk
1818139 you hope to get a deal but its something that is never going away
1818140 we have coaches online just about every day trying to book flights at reasonable rates and theyre nowhere close to where they were before
1818141 its a guessing game you dont know whether to lock in a rate you just hope you get lucky
1818142 in sports where you wish to be competitive youre still going to have to find a way to do it
1818143 theres going to be more pressure on selling tickets more pressure on fundraising
1818144 ill look at carl when i say this and he can slap me if he wants
1818145 he wasnt ready to win a championship i think until this year
1818146 i think this year he can go head to head with jimmie johnson tony stewart with anybody else thats there and i think he can close the deal
1818147 i dont necessarily agree 100 percent but i get the point
1818148 ill put it this way i feel like im better as a race car driver than ive ever been i dont know if i wasnt ready to win a championship or something like that but i can tell you that i feel like ive learned a lot
1818149 the championship ultimately winds up being determined by how well you do when things go bad
1818150 its when you have to say my cars not right weve had a little wreck you know somethings happened
1818151 do you go on and self destruct or do you manage to be in the frame of mind where you can go on and get the most out of it
1818152 right now they and carl and bob are in the same league with the best unless youve got that level of maturity and wisdom and presence and experience that gives you that within the organization having a lot of speed in the car being able to win a lot of races is not going to do it
1818153 when things go bad youre going to disintegrate carl is going to be able to overcome that this year im real confident
1818154 the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers regardless of their relative motion or of the motion of the source of the light
1818155 st valentines day a holiday named after various early christian who became models of selfless love surviving in cruel circumstances yet nowadays this holiday is mainly associated with romantic love it is just a day to spend on chocolates flowers trips lingerie and romantic dates i think its time we forget about this meaningless stuff to focus on the true meaning of this day love peace and global unity
1818156 guess what i just took my picture with erin from beantown west
1818157 we still need to push very hard in the development of the car and the reliability but even in a worse case like this were still in the championship completely
1818158 were still in the fight well be pushing very hard over the break
1818159 we are very sad for felipe because he did in my view the best race of his career today
1818160 it was fantastic in the way he attacked and the way he managed the race so we are very disappointed for that
1818161 i think im still growing a lot and learning race to race and that can help for the championship the confidence and thats the most important thing
1818162 i think for the moment everything is completely open we have three cars in a very small gap in terms of points
1818163 hes very strong for sure this kind of race if youre able mentally to manage after the disappointment you have you will only get stronger
1818164 and this is what were going to do together because that is the way we are going to approach the next race in valencia
1818165 when the track is clear we showed that we have the speed when there is traffic we cant take advantage
1818166 it was a disappointing weekend for me but at least i managed to come away with a decent result
1818167 we had good speed in the race and without the mistake in qualifying it would be better
1818168 i was like where the heck did he get that squeegee at i thought maybe he stopped at a gas station on the way to the track it was funny
1818169 if you worry about it youll perform worse most of the time
1818170 i went off track a couple of times but the car was fast and hopefully well have the same type of car this weekend
1818171 the last five races and ever since we won the pole in loudon its given us a little bit more confidence and now were running top 20 a little bit more
1818172 im starting to battle with the cup drivers a little bit more where i couldnt early on out there
1818173 you still have to be smooth but you can enter a corner as late as you want and just abuse the car i think you need a little bit more finesse with a stock car than you do with an indy car otherwise you will just burn everything up
1818174 you have to let the car do what it wants
1818175 thats the biggest thing ive learned im still learning every race that we go to every track that i race on im still learning a little bit more and more
1818176 things dont happen so fast as when youre in an indy car
1818177 even at an oval track like las vegas i was coming down the straightaway and i would snap sideways with the car but on a road course things happen a little bit more slowly

1818220 clean safe water is vital for sustaining our health and our environment yet without the critical resources to prevent its contamination from oil spills our water supply is at great risk
1818221 thats why weve developed the roc barrier tm a first of its kind response system designed to reach and contain an oil spill rapidly before it spreads out over the water and stretches onto the shoreline where it has the greatest ecological impact
1818222 our global goal is to ensure all marinas ports harbours shipping lanes beaches waterfront resorts and water conservation areas are prepared with the roc barrier tm so that it is readily available to be deployed quickly after an oil spill occurs
1818223 we plan to launch the roc barrier tm internationally later this year

1818262 antreprenorii romani au o parere foarte buna despre afacerile lor si tin la pret
1818263 au mai fost inchiriate pentru un an incepand cu 1 mai 2008 si hotelurile majestic olimp si majestic jupiter
1818264 antreprenorii romani au o parere foarte buna despre afacerile lor si tin la pret
1818265 antreprenorii romani au o parere foarte buna despre afacerile lor si tin la pret
1818266 in romania nu avem un bazin foarte mare din care sa alegem companiile de exemplu intr un judet numarul de companii cu cifra de afaceri de peste 20 de milioane de euro este foarte mic de ordinul trei din zece
1818267 de multe ori ne lovim de alte fonduri de private equity in cautare la fel ca noi de proiecte cu potential de foarte multe ori mi s a intamplat sa mi se spuna de catre antreprenori ca au mai fost contactati inainte de alte fonduri sau ca dupa noi au mai intrebat si alte fonduri
1818268 n as putea spune ca proiectele romanesti au fost extraordinar de profitabile antreprenorii romani au o parere foarte buna despre afacerile lor si tin foarte mult la pret uneori am ales sa investim in cehia sau slovacia din cauza pretului prea ridicat cerut de antreprenorii romani
1818269 companiile au cicluri de crestere si descrestere e usor atunci cand pornesti de la zero sa iti dublezi afacerile in trei ani cresterea devine mai dificila insa dupa ce compania a atins un anumit prag de maturitate atunci entuziasmul nu mai este de ajuns ci este nevoie de un management profesionist si infuzii de capital
1818270 pentru ca pachetele pe care le pot oferi managerilor sunt aproape imposibil de batut in piata
1818271 faptul ca managerul primeste o data la patru sau cinci ani un bonus care poate urca pana la cateva milioane de euro nu poate fi egalat de nicio corporatie
1818272 sa spunem ca exiturile din polonia au facut milionari manageri care ulterior au devenit coinvestitori ai fondurilor noastre in anumite dealuri
1818273 antreprenorii romani au o parere foarte buna despre afacerile lor si tin la pret
1818274 am avut trei ani in care fondurile pentru sustinerea programului de investitii au fost suficiente atat prin majorarea de capital pe care omv a realizat o in momentul privatizarii petrom majorare de 800 de milioane de euro cat si prin cash flow ul generat de activitatile noastre acum aceste surse nu mai sunt suficiente in conditiile in care ne am propus sa realizam anual investitii de 1 5 miliarde de euro in perioada 2008 2010
1818275 suntem in discutii cu un club de banci format din peste cinci institutii financiare internationale dar care au activitati si in romania pentru contractarea unui credit de pana la 500 de milioane de euro pentru sustinerea programului de investitii speram ca intr o luna sa finalizam aceste discutii am luat in considerare riscurile pe care le include o finantare intr o tara emergenta dar totusi imprumutul va fi realizat pe piata locala in numele petrom
1818276 aceasta este suma pe care o puteam ridica de pe piata locala luand in considerare situatia financiara a petrom in momentul in care vom contracta acest credit vom vedea un impact asupra rezultatului financiar dar deocamdata nu cred ca avem nevoie de produse de hedging pentru a ne proteja de eventualele riscuri de piata oricum daca va fi necesara abordarea unor astfel de masuri acestea se vor face la nivel de grup de catre omv actionarul majoritar
1818277 volatilitatea va continua dar noi vom ramane in continuare foarte atenti la orice posibilitate pe care ne o ofera piata externa pe segmentul de explorare si productie si pe partea de retail pe pietele externe pe care suntem prezenti ne gandim la optimizarea retelei care ar putea duce la cresterea numarului de statii fie prin investitii greenfield fie prin achizitii dar deocamdata nu avem o decizie concreta luata in acest sens
1818278 petrom este in continuare compania petroliera din ece cu cel mai ridicat potential de crestere care va fi realizat dupa finalizarea modernizarii rezultatele ne au aratat insa ca procesul de modernizare este departe de a fi gata si nici chiar actualele preturi ridicate ale petrolului nu feresc petrom de probleme
1818279 petrom a raportat pierderi operationale de 74 de milioane de lei pe segmentul de rafinare si marketing ceea ce nu este deloc rau ne asteptam ca rezultatul din rafinare al petrom sa devina pozitiv abia dupa retehnologizarea rafinariei petrobrazi
1818280 antreprenorii romani au o parere foarte buna despre afacerile lor si tin la pret
1818281 productivitate si competitivitate aceasta este esenta programului de guvernare al pd l cuvintele suna abstract cum spuneti dar asta i batalia nu poti ajunge din urma uniunea europeana cu o tara net importator de produse agricole in loc sa beneficiem de actuala criza alimentara noi suferim din plin aceasta criza ne am propus ca in patru ani sa rasturnam acest deficit si sa facem din romania un exportator net de produse agricole
1818282 este de asemenea nevoie de o reforma a pietei pamantului adica de stimularea gruparii terenurilor pe care sa fie constituite ferme care sa produca pentru piata avem in program structurarea agriculturii pe zone legumicultura in anumite zone la fel pomicultura sau viticultura
1818283 iesirea pe pietele externe cu produse cu valoare adaugata mare este esentiala romania nu are acum posibilitatea sa si faca reclama in afara dar daca agricultura va fi restucturata pe lanturi de producatori si cu un ajutor de promovare important transformarea agriculturii romanesti intr un exportator net este posibila
1818284 programul nostru este eminamente de dreapta nu va fi in functie de ce ne mai da guvernul ci va stimula productivitatea si competitivitatea vom avea un buget pe patru ani dar nu pot detalia in stadiul acesta al discutiei in orice caz nu va fi un program de tip psd
1818285 de asemenea descentralizarea trebuie dusa pana la capat uitati va la inundatiile de acum de ce trebuie sa astepte judetele ajutor de la guvern si sa stea cu mana intinsa nu de ajutor au nevoie problema este de a descentraliza administratia si de a lasa finantarea la nivel local vom urgenta descentralizarea administratiei publice pentru ca este absurd ca intr o vreme in care vorbim de facturi online sa vedem in continuare oameni tinuti zile in sir in fata ghiseelor pentru a obtine o autorizatie
1818286 nu oamenii sunt problema avem destui oameni bine pregatiti esentia intr o guvernare este programul acelei guvernari

1818292 bubbles lead investors to make errors in judgment thereby mispricing assets on the way up
1818293 there is no reason for outrage the man was a rapist
1818294 if we had the death penalty here there wouldnt be so many crimes
1818295 the death of this boy reflects the depth of the social breakdown we have reached
1818296 were concerned for the precedent that the execution may create for the rights of mexican nationals who may be detained in that country
1818297 this is another murder because no one has the right to take someone elses life only god
1818298 potters not selling hes buying why because were panicking and hes not
1818299 where else are you going to get an organization where the ceo answers the phone himself
1818300 no one is screening calls hes created an organization that is very approachable
1818301 it became apparent right away even to slow moving guys like ourselves that this was a decent way to make our business a bit bigger and make money
1818302 its just that another opportunity would come over the hill usually an independent would phone wanting to retire or sell out asking if we were interested in buying them
1818303 unfortunately we had to give up on the kcj which was not our first choice
1818304 with hindsight we were fortunate to have made that decision early on because today it would really be hemorrhaging the daily industry is not good now and being the third daily in the market would be a recipe for losing money
1818305 he has created a tremendous amount of circulation and produces papers at a low cost
1818306 it is good for local journalism because they are covering local news in the community and doing it profitably as the result of the resources that he has those operations are able to be successful while on their own without economies of scale they couldnt
1818307 the challenge is to find any sector of business that is not being consolidated
1818308 the fact is the number of choices will decline the publishing industry is no different
1818309 we know from people who we used to represent some didnt stay long because of working conditions
1818310 in the northwest weve had to do that in order to attract and keep decent reporters
1818311 at one time we were probably a little low down there until we realized it was more important to keep the longer term employee
1818312 it occurred to us after we bought a few papers and started to tie them together we found there was a little extra profit in this
1818313 it was obvious the cluster strategy was the way to go
1818314 if you try to sell the kent reporter you wont get that much pickup maybe 10 percent
1818315 it is better to give it away and be able to offer a better package to the advertisers than to sell to 10 percent of the homes and attract fewer advertisers in the suburbs thats the game
1818316 a defendant who is the sitting sheriff of this county should know what the law is
1818317 i question if a motion for a mistrial is appropriate
1818318 are democrats really prepared to close the government in order to stop drilling
1818319 because i think the country will find that to be a suicidal strategy
1818320 if democrats want to block what a majority of the house and senate want they can proceed with a strategy that would in effect shut down the government
1818321 but it is not surprising newt gingrich would raise that threat since he and the republican party shut down the government in the 1990s
1818322 we shut the federal government down for a brief period in order to get a balanced budget
1818323 republicans are doing nothing but pushing the failed johnny one note policies of the past
1818324 and i think weve got a lot of energy left in us dont we
1818325 i think the energy level has shifted between the two parties in the last couple weeks
1818326 and my hunch is there are a lot of democrats back home who are tap dancing
1818327 i dont think its his lineage nor do i think its his policies i think its the fact that hes young and relatively inexperienced
1818328 you hear all the time people say well is he really ready to be president someone his age someone who hasnt been in washington that long someone who doesnt seem to have a lot of experience with national security or foreign affairs
1818329 our politics has gotten so nasty thats the word i was looking for but not just nasty also cynical and manipulative
1818330 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks jeffrey taylor u s attorney for the district of columbia told a news conference
1818331 we are now beginning the process of concluding this investigation once this process is complete we will formally close the case
1818332 we have this anthrax death to america death to israel
1818333 ivins has claimed that he was suffering serious mental health issues in the months preceding the attacks and told a co worker that he had incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and feared that he might not be able to control his behavior
1818334 for the most part as time goes on the illness known as depression is becoming more treatable
1818335 i am hoping we can make this walk bigger and better than ever
1818336 our analysis reveals unsurprisingly that foreclosures and home prices have negative effects on each other over time but this does not imply a vicious cycle of collapsing prices our models predict that as foreclosures continue to climb in many states house prices will remain flat or decline in those states but will not collapse
1818337 while modifications are growing they are not keeping pace with the growing number of defaults and foreclosures
1818338 ive lost everything and have nothing to return to my house was stolen and everything in it and now i have no family in iraq
1818339 no indication that large numbers of refugees have returned because of a positive reassessment of security conditions
1818340 far more than improved conditions at home it is unbearable conditions in exile that appear to have been the determining factor in most returns
1818341 people increasingly need financial assistance to keep a roof over their heads
1818342 the right time is now i cannot wait for that slow poke trailing behind
1818343 my mother was a r n for 38 years she had me when she was 15 and she quit school my father then broke up with her she worked as a nursing assistant for so many years before that then she met a man who became my step father and he asked her one day if she was tired of earning pennies and if she wants to do something more after that she enrolled in a nursing school she walked through that examination just like that she did it and you can too
1818344 oh dont you be worried you can do it i know you can do it worry is something you dont want to do i do that before too i sit by myself and worry tell yourself you can do it and you can by worrying youll just cloud your mind and mess up on the day you take your test dont worry and youll just walk through that test im telling you you can do it sister there are worse things than that test youve gotten over some bigger things than that pause havent you
1818345 well there you go and that is why you can do this sister youll walk through that test and youll do fine youre gonna get there
1818346 i finally realized if i dont have my health i have nothing
1818347 give a man a fish you have fed him for today teach a man to fish and you have fed him for a lifetime
1818348 clearly we are not saying the powervault or any rgpc product is green
1818349 however if an rgpc dealer can sell a 25 000 power management device like powervault because the homeowner offsets a percentage of that cost with rebates or tax credits earned by installing a renewable energy system everyone benefits the dealer the homeowner and the planet
1818350 look mama look see my hands when i kick really hard i can make my bouncy seat bounce wanna see yay squeal giggle look i see the kitty hi kitty
1818351 be the person you want to be at the expense of everything
1818352 how to make your pcs feel like theyre in the country

1818354 we havent examined the aircraft yet weve never had a copter go down due to firefighting efforts
1818355 at this point he provided essentially no biographical data about himself before 1993
1818356 we want to find out if he is indeed christopher chichester
1818357 and if so if theres anything he can tell us about the disappearance and possible homicide of the sohuses
1818358 our experience tells us hes more of a schemer than someone who has lost his memory
1818359 he loves his daughter kidnapping doesnt apply it was his own kid
1818360 just because hes reighs natural father it doesnt absolve him
1818361 wait a minute this is wrong it has to change
1818362 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
1818363 certain genetic mutations identical to the anthrax used in the attacks
1818364 afforded all of the equipment and containment facilities which would have been needed to prepare the anthrax letters used in the fall 2001 attacks
1818365 provide no legitimate reason for the extended work hours other than home was not good and that he went to the laboratory to escape from his home life
1818366 i wouldnt necessarily make the conclusion that just because he had access to a lyophilizer and used a lyophilizer that that provides a smoking gun that he must be using this for sinister purposes
1818367 i think the public and the survivors of the anthrax attacks are entitled to see the evidence before the grand jury
1818368 and if there was a draft indictment and they were ready to indict mr ivins they ought to see that as well
1818369 the chinese are clearly hyper focused and hyper worried about security and this is something theyve been working on for at least three or four years by now
1818370 we have strengthened security work in all olympic venues and in the olympic village we are well prepared in security for the upcoming games
1818371 we think the olympics will proceed and they will proceed smoothly and well we think the chinese have got it covered as far as humanly possible
1818372 theres been a lot issues about this raised about how this technology will be used after the games and even during the games
1818373 i doubt that group has the wherewithal to make it to central beijing and to intervene in the olympics but it is a threat and there are many other threats
1818374 beijing as the host city will of course make full preparations for biological attacks like anthrax we have even made antibiotics and vaccines
1818375 but they shouldnt have destroyed my house evicted me and left me homeless
1818376 oh but look at the price it used to be
1818377 the example below is the more traditional example of arbitrage buy ibm stock at 5 discount from internal corporate market and immediately sell it on nyse for the 5 difference there still is risk even in this transaction because the nyse transaction wont be instantaneous and the price can fluctuate
1818378 our advanced external sound synthesis technology increases pedestrian safety while retaining the cars environmental benefits
1818379 we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety

1818403 our new web site will be an important element in our effort to build a culture of preparedness that will aid in saving lives and businesses
1818404 the team at schipul the web marketing company understands that every crisis is a human crisis and their passion about preparing employees and the community for the next disaster can be felt throughout the web site theyve created
1818405 while we expect continued housing and economic weakness will affect our overall performance this year we continue to maintain a surplus over all regulatory capital requirements

1818407 the amount of video being delivered for this years olympics exceeds all the prior summer games broadcasts in terms of hours and complexity
1818408 our biggest challenge is the scale of what we are doing and the many different standards of the various new media formats
1818409 it seems like every day nbc is signing up a new distribution outlet with a new format
1818410 we have done a lot of different video players for different clients what is unique about this one is bringing content that has never been seen before online up until relatively recently a very small amount of the games were televised now you watch every minute of whatever contest that you want to see
1818411 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1818412 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1818413 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1818414 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001

1818416 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1818417 many serious application developers are not even present on the web which tends to overemphasize academic and hobbyist views

1818419 robert dewar is ignoring an important change in the software engineering community
1818420 do you need to know something about engines to be a professional driver nowadays i dont think so taxi drivers dont know that much about their engines there is of course an exception if we look at the high tech side of the car industry in car racing then you need to know something about the car engine in order to get the most out of it
1818421 if we translate this to the story of robert dewar then he is either still in the old days of computing or he is only surrounded by very high tech and demanding companies i suspect that he is a little of both
1818422 consequently cs majors sail through a curriculum of math lite earning a smiley face on their papers for developing projects using pre built libraries
1818423 it shows that he doesnt understand that nowadays its important to select the right components and assemble them into a working application its a skill to do this right it is far from easy given the vast amount of libraries you dont need to know about pointers or learn to program ada to become excellent in this skill
1818424 we are now in an age of reusing components only very complex software projects with lots of real time and reliability requirements can afford to stay close to the metal so should we educate people to be able to develop software for those few complex systems or should we teach them how to make the right choices of what languages and libraries to use for the job
1818425 i agree that the list is indeed meaningless in the context of the anti java professor he wants to educate people in the good old way of engineering nothing wrong with that we only monitor new trends such as the need for dynamic typing the introduction of generics and the integration of functional programming elements in object oriented languages we try to understand why the programming language market is moving in such directions that is something completely different
1818426 if all we do is train students to be able to do simple web programming in java they wont get jobs since those are the jobs that can be easily outsourced
1818427 he is right in this but outsourced to whom india china the scope of the tiobe index is the entire world not only the u s software market so this doesnt count as an argument against the tiobe index
1818428 i wonder if anyone has met cathy or rusty lately

1818431 the only thing ive seen her actually do is sit around in an office reading stuff about her daughter online and then calling the people up like you gotta take that offline

1818433 estos trastornos suceden dentro de una poca de muchas crisis de redefiniciones sociales y personales vivimos en un entorno donde al afecto a la intimidad y a las relaciones no se les presta atenci n los j venes inmersos en este entorno encuentran problemas para redefinir su identidad y para poder describir conocer e identificar sus emociones

1818451 detonated the warhead near apogee not over the target area where the thing would eventually land but at altitude
1818452 the only plausible explanation we can find is that the iranians are figuring out how to launch a missile from a ship and get it up to altitude and then detonate it
1818453 and thats exactly what you would do if you had a nuclear weapon on a scud or a shahab 3 or other missile and you wanted to explode it over the united states
1818454 if even a crude nuclear weapon were detonated anywhere between 40 kilometers to 400 kilometers above the earth in a split second it would generate an electro magnetic pulse emp that would cripple military and civilian communications power transportation water food and other infrastructure
1818455 the first indication of such an attack would be that the power would go out and some but not all the telecommunications would go out we would not physically feel anything in our bodies
1818456 so you would be walking you wouldnt be driving at that point
1818457 and it wouldnt do any good to call the maintenance or repair people because they wouldnt be able to get there even if you could get through to them
1818458 we wouldnt be able to pump the fuel into the trucks and get the trucks to the warehouses
1818459 would quickly revert to an early 19th century type of country
1818460 most of the things we depend upon would be gone and we would literally be depending on our own assets and those we could reach by walking to them
1818461 people in hospitals would be dying faster than that because they depend on power to stay alive but then it would go to water food civil authority emergency services and we would end up with a country with many many people not surviving the event
1818462 you have to go back into the 1800s to look at the size of population
1818463 id have to say that 70 to 90 percent of the population would not be sustainable after this kind of attack
1818464 explicitly discuss a nuclear emp attack that would gravely harm the united states
1818465 one of the nations in the middle east had launched a ballistic missile from a cargo vessel they had taken a short range probably scud missile put it on a transporter erector launcher lowered it in taken the vessel out into the water peeled back the top erected it fired it lowered it and covered it up and the ship that they used was using a radar and electronic equipment that was no different than 50 60 100 other ships operating in the immediate area
1818466 well known to the white house but have not been disseminated to the appropriate congressional committees
1818467 could be used in a devastating stealth attack against the united states or israel for which the united states has no known or planned defense
1818468 the use of an atomic bomb against israel would destroy israel completely while the same against the islamic only would cause damages such a scenario is not inconceivable
1818469 an emp attack on america would send us back to the horse and buggy era without the horse and buggy
1818470 if youre a terrorist this is your ultimate goal your ultimate asymmetric weapon
1818471 they could do it either directly or anonymously by putting some freighter out there on the ocean
1818472 its well known that people dont go on a diet until theyve had a heart attack
1818473 and we as a nation are having a heart attack
1818474 as of today we have no defense against such an attack we need space based missile defenses to protect against an emp attack
1818475 nuclear missiles dont discriminate on party lines when they land
1818476 senator obama has been quoted as saying i dont agree with a missile defense system and that we can cut 10 billion of the research out never mind as i say that the entire budget is 9 6 billion or 9 3 billion
1818477 needs a missile defense that is so strong in all the different phases we need to defend against that countries will decide its not worth coming up against us
1818478 thats one of the things that defeated the soviet union
1818479 we apologize for the confusion but in an abundance of caution we treated this unaccounted for laptop as a serious potential breach
1818480 were glad to confirm that a preliminary investigation shows no personal information was compromised
1818481 those who miss the operations in the gaza strip dont worry they will come
1818482 dry cleaners purchase 85 percent of wire hangers consumed in the united states
1818483 they have seen their costs more than double this issue is obviously critically important to their economic future
1818484 in the midst of a difficult economic and banking environment first asian banks performance is very encouraging we have the cleanest loan portfolio possible and we continue to provide loan funding and increase our assets
1818485 with 40 percent of the worlds children located in china and india these two countries are obviously important targets for one laptop per child
1818486 coordinators of the event consider kenneth cole one of the most engaging and engaged business leader activists in the country
1818487 it is an honor and a privilege to have kenneth cole a figure on the front line of fashion trends aids awareness and social activism as our 2008 keynote in 1985 kenneth cole was the first member of the fashion community to take a public stand in the fight against aids
1818488 kenneth cole has made one of the single most remarkable philanthropic commitments in contemporary america a commitment that breaks down the barriers between the public interest and corporate sectors and between deeply held personal values of equity and justice and day to day business concerns in doing so he proves that a social conscience and business acumen are not mutually exclusive and provides a role model for a new kind of corporate philanthropy

1818490 alices policy of holding our elected officials and those whom we have endorsed accountable for their actions in office
1818491 implication that apas are half asian half american and is ludicrous when we have been in what is now the u s since the 1500s
1818492 stations like ktsf do a disservice to the asian american market as they niche asian communities and then pitch programming in their languages to me thats horribly uninspired
1818493 i am a firm believer that there is room for an english asian pop culture channel
1818494 it was great that comcast aired the channel on a part time basis but that was not the best use of their spectrum nor the best way to represent the channel
1818495 iatv was one of the least accessed channels in the san francisco
1818496 customer service surveys continually showed low interest for this station
1818497 for our viewers in the city there are 17 other alternatives that cater to the asian community
1818498 watching these programs made me more aware and in touch with my asian american heritage
1818499 sometimes asian americans may bring cultural norms that may not be the most effective in communicating at work such as deferring to elders in their families which can limit their ability to get results in discussions with both superiors and peers
1818500 they frequently ask the manager for permission or approval to do something instead of making the decisions themselves

1818538 in the course of our research we were surprised by the amount of medical inaccuracies that these newspapers had published said dr racine some journalists even wrote about mrs schiavos reactions to specific words or expressions supposedly showing that she was conscious
1818539 our observations show that the press capitalized on the controversy to a large extent and selling copies mattered more than delivering scientific information media coverage sustained myths and false hopes
1818540 the public debate surrounding this case showed that the medical ethical and legal consensuses on the legitimacy of the withdrawal of treatment in accordance to a patients will were challenged
1818541 this case is quite original because it reveals the emergence of a pro life social stream a trend that has now reached canada
1818542 features the other neat thing about the 2 0 version is that it now includes the multi snapshot feature i like so much in the workstation 6 0 product now we can have the best of both worlds
1818543 il gioco andato avanti fin troppo la mia integrit morale mi ha impedito di interromperlo prima ho voluto rispettare fin quanto stato possibile lultima volont di roberto de laurentiis il grande produttore che per primo ha creduto a questo film e che ci ha lasciato a gennaio conservo ancora il suo sms sul telefonino con cui mi pregava di scrivere un ruolo adatto a corona ho mantenuto limpegno finch ho potuto ho affrontato mille critiche da parte del pubblico della stampa e pure di alcuni ambienti dello spettacolo che non gradivano questo blitz di un personaggio tanto scomodo nel loro campo corona avrebbe avuto modo di affrontare un film di alto valore morale e sociale che avrebbe potuto farlo riflettere sui valori della vita e dellamore ma ora sono profondamente delusa dal suo atteggiamento non solo calpesta il mio lavoro ma col suo modo di fare maltratta il senso profondo di unopera che stata scritta per far riflettere sui drammi delladolescenza e sul grande valore e spessore umano dei nostri poliziotti
1818544 semplice ha sistematicamente violato il contratto mettendo a rischio tra laltro lintero progetto
1818545 ha usato questo film per promuovere s stesso anche qui senza nessun rispetto delle regole contrattuali ad esempio da otto mesi rilascia interviste ai settimanali senza mai chiedere autorizzazione alcuna per lo sfruttamento economica dellopera dellingegno diritti che a tuttoggi appartengono a me rispettare il copyright una ovviet che qualunque attore conosce lui no il culmine stato raggiunto con la partecipazione al programma markette di chiambretti a la 7 il 14 febbraio scorso della sua ex moglie nina moric in quelloccasione anche la moric ha promosso la partecipazione di corona al film addirittura con laiuto di una falsa locandina preparata daglia autori della trasmissione
1818546 sono profondante deluso da corona ha dimostrato di avere una personalit forte ma non rispetta nessuna regola con la scelta di sciogliere il contratto abbiamo per dimostrato a quanti ci criticavano che far interpretare un ruolo cos delicato a corona non era una speculazione commerciale volevamo onorare un impegno morale contratto dallautrice con roberto de laurentiis abbiamo fatto il possibile adesso per non possiamo permettere che si danneggi un film che da fine agosto vedr sul set un grande cast
1818547 daremo la notizia presto posso garantire che si tratta di un nome importante di certo sar un vero attore
1818548 we are so near the work center i can leave my home at 8 45 and arrive by 9
1818549 i understand what were trying to do here so im not too rusty coming back
1818550 i felt pretty good tuesday and came out and threw strikes
1818551 i dont turn anybody away from giving back to the kids
1818552 bob is a responsible person and he works hard and ive got confidence in him
1818553 ill keep bringing him in there ill continue to do so the home run ball has hurt him maybe hes in a little bit of an unfortunate streak when you make a bad pitch and somebody hits it he goes out there and competes and gives you everything hes got i expect him to have a pretty good finish for us
1818554 i looked at the film and the catcher was sitting on the outside corner and the ball came back over the middle of the plate
1818555 i was pretty pleased about last night but i have to get my sinker back
1818556 overall i was pleased after not throwing in a game for a while
1818557 im not going to interrupt anything thats going on right now
1818558 im so surprised im so thankful all those people shouting my name i cant describe the feeling
1818559 i think we all are trying to do our part complement all the superstars we have on this team
1818560 there is a lot of leadership here especially with the veterans on the team you look around and you see everybody talking and helping we know what our role is and thats all we are trying to do
1818561 im playing more a lot more which always helps any player
1818562 im strong im healthy im ready to go whenever they need me i think i have always been the same but when you get in there all the time it makes a difference
1818563 i feel very happy that theyve been able to give me that opportunity and hopefully i can take advantage of it
1818564 you always come prepared and do whatever it is you need to do i make sure im always ready you have to take advantage of the moment but playing baseball just comes naturally
1818565 im just trying to have a good season and be consistent because everything starts with consistency
1818566 i thank god that i am here its been a long road to get here i know that its a blessing
1818567 i dont know the reason for it all i can tell you is that each one of us is giving everything weve got right now there is a responsibility we all share because we are within grasp of something really good
1818568 all the doom and gloom that was in here two days ago
1818569 and we end up with a 4 2 road trip weve got good talented players and were playing good baseball
1818570 its great that we can take some games on the road
1818571 its hard to put your finger on why its hard for a team to win on the road i dont know if its home field advantage or what and how that relates to baseball youre still playing the same thing on the same field
1818572 knowing what happened on the road last year and the lack of success that we had it seems that we have finally addressed the issue now we need to continue our current success at home
1818573 rickie got hot this time of year last year too even though theres a lot of people that get on him because they dont really look beyond the day to day happenings rickie has been swinging the bat very very well since the all star break
1818574 it is well established in ohio that to succeed in acquiring title by adverse possession the claimant must show exclusive possession that is open notorious continuous and adverse for 21 years
1818575 we have never held that a claimant must establish subjective intent to acquire title to real property of another to prevail on an adverse possession claim
1818576 if the adverse possessor intends a wrongful disseizin deliberate seizure of anothers property his actual possession for the relevant time gives him a title or if the adverse possessor occupies what he believes to be his own a similar possession gives him a title
1818577 the court of appeals concluded that the evaniches acted in a way consistent with true ownership by installing landscaping that included railroad ties stone blocks fencing bushes flowers and at least one tree it held that the evaniches possessed the necessary intent based on their exclusive control over the property for 35 years seeing no error in the court of appeals conclusion that the evaniches took possession of the disputed property via adverse possession we therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeals

1818584 its time to retire these old policies and bring new energy to america
1818585 this is a decisive year for me bulluck 31 said tuesday
1818586 i dont know what the organization is going to do but i am going to go out there and do what i have always done
1818587 i am going into the last two years of my contract and i have seen it before
1818588 as a player the only thing i can control is how i play so im going to go out and put my best foot forward like i have the past eight years and let everything else take care of itself
1818589 tejada gets a day off and i think a deserved day off
1818590 im sure he wasnt happy but youve got to do it
1818591 blum deserves an opportunity to swing it again today after the way he swung it yesterday
1818592 thered be no hesitation on our part to bring them back in the future
1818593 but yeah it stinks getting a taste of this and then having to go back to the minors
1818594 the code baseballs unwritten rules and its ignore at your own risk code of conduct
1818595 theres so many examples of the code in baseball that it really warranted a book
1818596 in baseball when you run up the score late or pimp a home run or swing out of your shoes on 3 and 0 pitch youre going to pay the consequences guys dont want to be shown up and its all about respect its always been fascinating to see that unseen side of the game and find out how this all came to be
1818597 the last real season a hilarious look back at 1975
1818598 baseball is its own animal its not like hockey where they allow the game to police itself and fighting is allowed in hockey youre accountable for your actions and you might lose teeth in baseball there are countless ways to retaliate and many of them seem juvenile but theyve evolved over the course of 150 years so you dont argue with it
1818599 you know that no one gets drilled by mistake that umpires keep notes of confrontational things forcing teams to be creative about how they retaliate that some managers and coaches keep notebooks that allow them to remember the details of how they were shown up and when the wheels of retaliation are set in motion the code takes over
1818600 i totally respect that for every guy who opened up the vault and spilled his guts there was another who wanted to keep these things secret and love it or hate it its a part of the game guys dont want to be dissed
1818601 his teammates told him whatever you do dont bunt but al said im a utility guy i cant hit a 100 mph fastball what else am i gonna do
1818602 so on the first pitch he bunts beats it out gets all excited and looks at his teammates the umpire says foul ball so al does this walk of shame and nolan walks over to him and just shoots this cutting stare at him
1818603 if you play like a jerk youre gonna get treated like a jerk
1818604 we got a great report on his catching and hes going to catch again tonight and if everything goes well hell be activated friday
1818605 so it kind of works both ways itll be nice to get some rest and you never know how it will be when he comes back im not sure if well be splitting it up like we were but im just happy to have him back
1818606 jims personal character valuable knowledge and passionate desire to see the stonehill student athletes and stonehill soccer program collectively succeed made him the clear choice to lead the program
1818607 with his knowledge of the program as a student athlete an alumnus and most recently as an assistant coach i am certain that his leadership will propel this program to new heights in the northeast 10

1818617 at forty years of the encyclical humanae vitae and despite the cultural opposition to this church teaching we are called to revisit this document and to realize how prophetic it was and still is it speaks of human love and openness to life
1818618 may we continue to grow in holiness on the personal level and to be present as a social body on the public scene particularly by promoting the values of the family
1818619 the sacredness of human life from the moment of conception to the last breath of natural death
1818620 humanae vitae discards contraception as a threat for human love and a slippery slope towards demoralization of our society
1818621 the message has not yet been truly received despite the confirmation that came from the evolution of the culture towards divorce abortion homosexuality and destruction of marriage and family these sad consequences were foretold to some extent in the message of humanae vitae
1818622 it is not easy to embody those values in todays context especially in canada where the culture of death is making further steps of domination by rewarding publicly an activist of abortion
1818623 i enjoyed thomas vinterbergs dogme film festen as it was a great insight into the fragility of family dynamics failing that the lion king
1818624 end the brutality to those who are forced to go through forced abortions and have no voice we are your voice
1818625 today we stand as a bold and prophetic witness against the tyranny and brutality by the chinese government against their own people
1818626 china also promotes the barbaric practice of forced abortion and sterilization while those who speak out against human rights abuses by the chinese government are crushed and trampled and the peaceful citizens of tibet have been brutalized by chinese leaders
1818627 today we follow the teachings of jesus in matthew 25 and stand in solidarity with our oppressed chinese brothers and sisters our public witness is a visible reminder that 100 000 military troops and abusive security measures cannot silence the voice of freedom justice and the power of the gospel of christ the truth will always be heard and we hope that president bush will boldly speak out against these human rights abuses on his official visit to china during the olympics
1818628 these study results suggest that many in hollywood are actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently showing it in a negative manner even more troubling than the marginalization of marriage and glorification of non marital sex on television is tvs recent obsession with outr sexual expression children and teens are now exposed to a host of sexual behaviors that less than a generation ago would have been considered off limits for broadcast television
1818629 behaviors that were once seen as fringe immoral or socially destructive have been given the stamp of approval by the television industry and recent studies show that children are influenced by those messages throughout much of the history of broadcast television the networks adhered to a voluntary code of conduct which stipulated that respect should be maintained for the sanctity of marriage and the value of the home our report finds that not only are the boundaries no longer respected they have been obliterated
1818630 for many years parents have worried about televisions glamorization of destructive sexual behavior this important new report suggests another cause for concern the de glamorization of marriage statistics show that the overwhelming majority of americans feel satisfied and fulfilled by their marriages the notion that sex outside of marriage is inherently more exciting more important more worthy as the subject of story telling is a toxic message for parents and children alike
1818631 broadcasters knowing televisions ability to influence behavior must exercise greater responsibility when handling sexual situations during primetime hours opting for less graphic visual content and favoring storylines that dont celebrate promiscuity glamorize criminality or denigrate monogamy
1818632 the american people need to hold the networks and their local broadcast affiliates accountable for pushing questionable content into their homes over the publicly owned broadcast airwaves in addition advertisers need to reconsider their role as underwriters of such material and whether they want to continue associating their brand names and hard earned corporate images with salacious sexual content while the supreme court awaits its next legal review of indecency on television now is the time for families to raise their collective voice against the tide of graphic sexual content invading their homes
1818633 genes and hormones may predispose a person to one sexuality rather than another but thats all predisposition and determination are two different things
1818634 if heterosexuality and homosexuality are indeed genetically predetermined how do we explain bisexuality or people who suddenly in mid life switch from heterosexuality to homosexuality or vice versa we cant
1818635 far more ambiguous blurred and overlapping than any theory of genetic causality can allow
1818636 examples of sexual flexibility dont square with genetic theories of rigid erotic predestination
1818637 to deny choice to make it appear that homosexuals cannot help it and to argue that any criticism of the gay lifestyle is as silly as criticism of being left handed or red haired
1818638 and this has been a deliberate strategy by homosexual activists they have done a very good job to convince a gullible public that homosexuals are born that way and cannot change
1818639 termination was not an option for me and i informed the doctor of this immediately

1818694 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
1818695 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
1818696 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
1818697 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
1818698 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
1818699 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s

1818702 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country

1818706 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy

1818708 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
1818709 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

1818781 so many people are aware of what solar can do for them whether its heating hot water or electricity theres just an amazing amount of awareness here
1818782 the hotter it is the less efficient they are so the fact is in the winter months solar panels are more efficient in cold weather

1818818 interestingly despite the higher than average socioeconomic status of this population the associations of individual education and neighborhood income with death after heart attack were stronger than those reported in many previous studies
1818819 we think our approach of evaluating two different and complementary indicators of socioeconomic status allowed us to capture a wider spectrum of this complex theory
1818820 higher levels of education also could directly affect health through greater knowledge acquired during schooling and greater empowerment and self efficacy
1818821 as recently reported education is strongly associated with health literacy which in turn affects ones ability to obtain process and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions

1818827 hold on a second jon i thought i was talking to you instead of debating john mccain but i am happy to let you serve as his proxy
1818828 it really is a glaring problem in his whole new politics formulation and his answer is weak i tried to strip out the bad stuff since he ultimately voted yes and has criticized mccain for doing the bidding of bush cheney and the oil companies it is easy to understand why he hopes the american people are uninterested
1818829 the real question for those debates in the fall is whether any of the moderators have the nerve to treat obama the way he was in philadelphia and the way he was in this interview with the same skepticism vigor and aggressiveness any candidate would receive
1818830 woopra is free of charge during the beta testing phase both free and paid plans will be available as soon as woopra is officially released
1818831 i have been stopped by the police and threatened with arrest which was very depressing
1818832 they insisted i stop which i did but i went back an hour and a half later and finished off the job
1818833 i really think it is kind of a win win situation
1818834 the authorities or whoever owns the land is getting it improved if it is neglected
1818835 it is now an official sort of public community gardened voluntary space
1818836 it is greener and in many ways a lot safer
1818837 you are unlikely to get crime in a place that looks attractive
1818838 it has given me a lot of confidence in myself and makes me feel useful and worthwhile
1818839 it gives me a purpose and is something i enjoy
1818840 i wasnt good enough and ended up at appalachian state this is the first time ive really worked in the state to be at the university of north carolina is great and working for coach butch davis is unbelievable just being around a guy with so much knowledge defensively im in a dream job
1818841 when you work with another guy that understands defense and he understands the dilemmas you have on defense it gives you another person to go to thats always comforting to know youve got people to bounce ideas off of
1818842 the defenses job is to get the offense the ball back
1818843 our job is to get them as many opportunities to score as possible if we look at it that way i think well be a better defense
1818844 you want to be good right down the middle or your defense and i feel like we can be good right down the middle of our defense
1818845 the biggest thing with guys that are as talented as marvin is continuing to push themselves to get better
1818846 i dont have to worry about that because coach john blake is going to push him every day the skys the limit for him hes athletic hes big hes strong hes on the path to be as good a player as he can be going into his second year
1818847 youve got some guys that have played and had good springs that we feel like can be leaders of our team
1818848 ill look at carl when i say this and he can slap me if he wants
1818849 he wasnt ready to win a championship i think until this year
1818850 i think this year he can go head to head with jimmie johnson tony stewart with anybody else thats there and i think he can close the deal
1818851 i dont necessarily agree 100 percent but i get the point
1818852 ill put it this way i feel like im better as a race car driver than ive ever been i dont know if i wasnt ready to win a championship or something like that but i can tell you that i feel like ive learned a lot
1818853 the championship ultimately winds up being determined by how well you do when things go bad
1818854 its when you have to say my cars not right weve had a little wreck you know somethings happened
1818855 do you go on and self destruct or do you manage to be in the frame of mind where you can go on and get the most out of it
1818856 right now they and carl and bob are in the same league with the best unless youve got that level of maturity and wisdom and presence and experience that gives you that within the organization having a lot of speed in the car being able to win a lot of races is not going to do it
1818857 when things go bad youre going to disintegrate carl is going to be able to overcome that this year im real confident
1818858 i have hopes still of getting david ragan in the chase which will be real exciting
1818859 of course matt and greg will make a good accounting of themselves too theyre in championship form the organizations look great
1818860 you need to show me ids with your signatures on it
1818861 if you dont want to vote there is the door and you can leave now

1818863 you can either give me what i told you to or you can just get out that door and find someplace else to vote
1818864 leroy nope we will not leave until you give us our rights weve a right to vote
1818865 your rules do not trump the laws of this state
1818866 you either do what youre told to vote or you get out of here now
1818867 sorry cant do that what you are asking is neither legal or fair lets settle this thing
1818868 we arent bothering them we are simply trying to vote and these people are breaking missouri state statutes preventing us from voting
1818869 look you are breaking their rules if you dont get out of here we are going to arrest you
1818870 their rules what rules those are employees of the election board they are under the mandate of the election board and then the sos arent you more concerned about the breaking of state laws
1818871 were trying to become a great one well do anything we can to get better and if that involves looking at other players by george thats our job thats our responsibility
1818872 just how he was doing where he was with the process things like that
1818873 the players want resolution they want what everybody wants to come out here every day and talk about somebody that is not here and then shows up its gone on too long and understandably so they want to play football
1818874 obviously theres no closure as of yet but i think weve kind of been told whats going on and i think we all kind of know where everything stands
1818875 from what i understand for the most part its taken care of
1818876 now its just about the packers and not about the situation its over now from what i understand its pretty much over

1818885 if you were to include the road traffic accidents related to work which resulted in deaths and the increasing number of deaths from industrial diseases such as mesothelioma the hse results would reveal a far darker picture of course we welcome any decrease in deaths at work but we must not allow any employer however large or small to get complacent and neglect the duty of care that they have to all of their employees
1818886 despite our record as the best major industrial nation in europe great britain can hardly be proud that 228 people died directly as a cause of their work a huge amount of effort is required to reduce the misery faced each year by families who lose a loved one due to negligence by an employer

1819000 the redesigned pulseaudio automatically adjusts the way it feeds audio data to accommodate system load and ensure the audio data is always ready when needed
1819001 somewhat one size fits all design that was not nearly as flexible
1819002 the way audio data flowed could be affected to a much greater degree by particular hardware devices or audio software applications

1819004 any of a number of scripting languages such as the bash shell python or perl making it completely extensible
1819005 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information
1819006 computer networks and the internet are an indispensable part of the world economy but even as they provide extraordinary opportunities for legitimate commerce and communication they also provide extraordinary opportunities for criminals where criminals are able to breach computer security systems as alleged here they have enormous ability to cause harm

1819008 we expect to hold the price point and add more and more value at that price point
1819009 we want to have commercial relationships with lots of companies and it matters more that we have that than exactly how much dollar per user were getting
1819010 we can certainly hold that price point we can continue to put more capabilities there the cost of an additional application to us is tiny its hardly material there are certainly types of applications that we could add that would add cost and we would price appropriately but i dont expect the price to climb that wouldnt be my expectation

1819023 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel

1819034 the artists help push the politics forward but you still need people who are leaders and hip hop has that
1819035 were asking to get 5 percent of the electorate so we can be at the table
1819036 theres no reason that theres only two parties at the table
1819037 if hip hop decides that they want to be at the table

1819068 many mortgage servicers and others in the servicing industry have told us about the progress they are making and expect to make to address the foreclosure crisis
1819069 unfortunately individuals facing foreclosure consumer advocates and others have painted a very different picture one that involves long waits and few if any meaningful loan modifications
1819070 the general view has been that principal write downs have been a last option for servicers because they represent an immediate loss for investors but even if meaningful leave investors and servicers with ongoing credit risk
1819071 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes

1819073 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1819074 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home

1819082 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1819083 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

1819097 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula

1819162 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1819163 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1819164 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1819165 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1819166 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
1819167 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1819168 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1819169 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1819170 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1819171 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1819172 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1819173 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1819174 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1819175 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1819176 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1819177 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1819178 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1819179 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

1819254 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1819255 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
1819256 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1819257 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1819258 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

1819261 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1819262 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1819263 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1819264 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1819265 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues

1819727 well you said to make 2 copies just now you said that what do i do with the originals
1819728 well some people say to make two copies but they really mean that you should have two copies total
1819729 these firms spend a lot of resources for r amp d
1819730 no you cant we need you here to answer the phones corina and i are so swamped with work
1819731 the artist is nothing without gift but gift is nothing without work
1819732 of course we are disappointed with the verdict we do not take cases to trial unless we believe a crime has been committed and the defendant was involved
1819733 that being said we respect the jurys decision they were very attentive throughout the trial and must be commended for the role they played in our judicial system
1819734 i am confident we did the best we could in presenting a very complex case
1819735 but that may have changed by today because we are processing
1819736 but we still dont have enough applicants that are qualified
1819737 if we dont have enough teachers i certainly wont put our students in the cafeteria we need teachers to open the schools
1819738 a lot of these things we dont know about until it actually rains
1819739 i did have conversations with submarine representatives monday morning and i questioned look what happened to the protocols that were set to notify us of incidences of accidents
1819740 i continue to be concerned there should be that urgency
1819741 they had discovered the radiation leak weeks ago and didnt inform the japanese government immediately
1819742 very very short conference call with the military on this issue
1819743 to see if there are some ways on what we can improve
1819744 were concerned about any leak and to us whether its a negligible leak or a large leak it doesnt matter its a concern so we will see what we can do as a people and as a government to improve any of the processes that are in place to ensure that we can make it better
1819745 even more disturbing the proposal by ironwood calls for rent at the new project to be increased to 120 percent
1819746 you have 50 or 60 people throwing in and all it takes is one person to contaminate the whole thing
1819747 these new problems do not portray guam in a positive light to our visitors and tourists
1819748 and we do talk to the mayors and our villagers
1819749 instead of banning the truck with the compactor on it they ban the compactor itself
1819750 certainly there are problems we dont discount that at all
1819751 but we have had very good cooperation with commercial haulers theyre paying a lot of attention to this
1819752 i dont have hair but if i did i would have been pulling it out
1819753 i dont have hair but if i did i would have been pulling it out
1819754 they are not doing a whole reinspection we are going back to the schools and targeting closed classrooms and cafeterias because we have to get those facilities or those parts of those facilities up and running
1819755 the inspectors will be focused on one area they will go into that room that was closed or that cafeteria that was closed or that lab that was closed and once they have given the ok it will be utilized
1819756 on the average our inspections whether with the task force or not take a half day or a full day
1819757 we have five days thats 10 schools thats less than a third of the total number of schools we need to inspect
1819758 we will be looking at all classrooms and all ensure all critical and non critical violations have been addressed
1819759 that was made clear to all parties involved i better double check to make sure they are in full understanding of that order

1819761 the gao stands by the facts conclusions and all aspects of the agencys aug 4 report on the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands

1819765 the introduction of these new programs helps address evolving online threats and provides more practical guidance to assess and manage risk
1819766 organizations need to implement both data protection policy and enforcement
1819767 one measure is insufficient blind enforcement without a well thought out policy can lead to decreases in productivity and outright rebellion against it controls policy without enforcement does little to deter the well motivated insider
1819768 the cost of losing or compromising the integrity of pii is also leading to a renewed focus on information security
1819769 the survey shows that 81 percent of the 1 600 respondents who named information security management as a number 3 concern said that security risks are not fully known or are only partially assessed using technology
1819770 if just one machine with access to critical data is left outside the enforcement domain the outsider threat and the insider threat and associated risks remain
1819771 it functions and projects still lack alignment with business objectives at many organizations
1819772 the ability to monitor system activity as well as inspect the content of files being transmitted or sitting at rest in storage devices for sensitive information or foreign applications is very important in mitigating these types of threats
1819773 china is the worlds fastest growing economy and it is critical that our students learn languages that allow them to successfully compete in the fast paced global business world
1819774 a hallmark of our school district is to provide opportunities and access for all students hosting cao pin provides that opportunity for students at a school that focuses on international studies
1819775 were more excited than ever about how the chinese guest teacher program continues to grow
1819776 having started out with 37 guest teachers in 2006 the total number of teachers hosted in the united states through the program for 2008 09 will be 193 including the 136 new participants
1819777 he could even bend you over the dining table hit it from the back and dust off your chandelier with that little ponytail two birds
1819778 the pinky is a wonderful finger its also the gayest finger which makes it the fanciest finger which makes it the best hell have to drink tea with his right hand hell have to pinky swear with his right hand too and its one of the skinniest things on our body whenever you feel fat just look at one of your pinkies i love my pinkies
1819779 she will also get shauna to deny the claims by going on every tv show from
1819780 this is surprising since an earlier tega measurement of surface materials was consistent with but not conclusive of the presence of perchlorate
1819781 we are committed to following a rigorous scientific process while we have not completed our process on these soil samples we have very interesting intermediate results
1819782 initial meca analyses suggested earth like soil further analysis has revealed un earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry
1819783 when surprising results are found we want to review and assure our extensive pre launch contamination control processes covered this potential
1819784 already won that shit he beat out lisa garza well get this shit the food network has also given adam is own show fuck me with a crooked pork chop because this isnt right lisa is the true star nobody can squint their eyes like she can and nobody can rock white anal beads the way she can she also reminds me of will work for food
1819785 he earned millions of fans across the country who have let us know that we have a second star in our midst we feel this series is a perfect fit for his talents letting him showcase his brand of humor while he works for food

1819788 because she was out clubbing and its on early in the morning so she was probably just rollin home feels bad
1819789 my kids are big fans of youtube usually the cats on skateboard kind of clips
1819790 i came to realize that its not just a great medium for skateboarding cats starting an online conversation was an excellent way to reach out to a huge audience largely youth that i dont normally connect with
1819791 youtube is primarily an entertainment network so i did wonder if people would engage in a serious discussion
1819792 it was a leap into the unknown for me but to be honest everything has exceeded my expectations the good and the bad theres more misunderstanding than i had appreciated more anger more bias but also more interest more support and more engagement
1819793 my favorite response is still one of the earliest ones i received are you michael jordans wife my husband found that one very funny
1819794 we have found in our polling that there is a new generation of global citizens developing people because of the internet because of opportunities for travel who have a global sensibility and greater appreciation for other people and other cultures
1819795 whats important here is that theres a direct correlation between those with global sensibilities and those who are networked via facebook and youtube and so on
1819796 these network facilities really enhance those kinds of global mentalities
1819797 theyre a nontraditional generation and we need nontraditional means to reach out and engage them their creativity energy and optimism can foster greater understanding and closer ties between people of different cultures and move us past these present hurdles
1819798 each particular variable is simple and obvious but it turns out that they interact in complicated ways
1819799 i think queen ranias youtube page is one of the more impressive attempts to use youtube for social change
1819800 its going to take some time before its meaningfully affecting global stereotypes but its a terrific start
1819801 more and more regular users are returning and moving beyond comments to conversations with new friends

1819836 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1819837 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1819838 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
1819839 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

1819900 youve still got to remember that the game of football is about people its not about systems
1819901 until that quarterback takes the ball and they have plays designed for him to run it its not a spread offense its just a one back offense
1819902 peyton manning is that a spread offense hes got three wideouts but they dont have pre designed runs for him so thats not a spread offense
1819903 its those quarterbacks that take off and run with the ball now youve got a spread offense now youve got another problem but theres not as many of those as everybody likes to believe they see three wideouts and they think ooh spread offense its not a spread its a one back offense
1819904 i dont know how many really true spread offenses there are
1819905 offensive coaches to be fancy someone says what kind of offense do your run oh we run a spread

1819910 we did this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool they are whitewashing their human rights record on tibet so our action today shines a spotlight on those atrocities in march tibetans took to the streets risking everything in their calls for justice and human rights and we stand today with this action in solidarity with those calls

1819939 higher gas prices lead to less driving and as new yorkers drive less the number of accidents should go down
1819940 fewer accidents should mean lower auto claim costs for insurance companies and my job is to make sure these savings are passed on in the form of lower rates for drivers

1819978 the thing about getting a much bigger house is the cost per square foot goes down because not many people want to take on a house that size
1819979 we took out part of the ceiling space and put in soundproofing to take out some of the noise
1819980 its no worse than living in a townhouse or duplex you hear footsteps and sometimes voices but because the building is solidly built its fine
1819981 its people wanting to adapt to a marketplace that has strained their resources so you get creative out of the box ideas floating around about how to enter in
1819982 on my single salary theres no way i could carry a mortgage
1819983 the four of us have decided that when it comes time well give serious consideration to using geothermal heating that type of thing
1819984 we often see parents and children and friends who buy together
1819985 in doing so these people are able to build home equity faster by combining resources and sharing in the profits of higher priced real estate
1819986 for the price of a condo we each got a good sized space and we own the building and we own the land
1819987 the price per square foot for a house when we bought was around 200 says ms
1819988 and the price per square foot for a new condo was getting up to 400
1819989 you cant have your car in the driveway and all the things that guys want
1819990 there was also at the time the pressure of getting into the market and getting a piece of land
1819991 i grew up here and i have lots of friends 35 to 45 who will probably never own a place
1819992 they never had jobs to allow them to buy places when they were under 30 and now the market is out of their reach
1819993 it sounds stupid but its almost like the whole friends experience on tv where they are living in separate apartments but they are always walking in on each other all the time
1819994 these new higher prices hit lower income people first and hardest but now wallets of every size are feeling the pinch
1819995 people will have to choose among cutting back on gas food or heat
1819996 the fiscal policy of the state needs to be balanced through discipline
