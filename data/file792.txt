7920000 it does create a little bit of a thought at the back of your mind
7920001 but nobody would say i wont go because i wont be paid its not a problem for us in our day to day work
7920002 the absence of a coc salary is a limiting factor on how many times you can volunteer and who can volunteer basically you are taking vacation time to do work elsewhere and you can only do that so much in a year
7920003 we are privileged to be there our transport and everything is paid for and we get the uniform
7920004 regardless of pay there have been good people involved because it is satisfying experience you are treated well and you gain skills
7920005 you come home and your patients know you were an olympic doctor that goes pretty far in promoting your practice there are so many benefits learning from this that i can rationalize in my mind this is a beneficial experience for me
7920006 this is the first time weve seen a prescribing change so quickly following this type of study and it shows that media exposure can influence health care
7920007 all of this attention benefits the patient and helps them make an informed medical decision and sometimes it just may save their life
7920008 the decision to switch between thiazolidinediones may have been prompted by a large randomized trial of pioglitazone that showed favourable cardiovascular outcomes leading physicians to believe that the purported ischaemic effects of rosiglitazone were not a class effect
7920009 next time i think that the election result could be very different because if the governments plans from their first term dont go so smoothly in the second term theyll be vulnerable
7920010 we want more doctors but we are getting family health teams

7920014 we dont care what the girls actually think we just want them to write porn for our amusement
7920015 would aj or rick ask their male contributors to write porn stories for deadspin
7920016 if we were to view injuries similarly to how we view other diseases then we would do something about it but unfortunately politicians and canadians have this fatalistic attitude it was an accident a freak accident time is up tickets up wrong place at the wrong time
7920017 there are thousands of these incidents that go on across the country on an hourly basis its insane that we just sit back and claim that were civilized that theres no public uproar
7920018 there is a minority of knuckleheads out there whose idea of a good time is letting the wind blow through your hair while youre liquored on a friday night thats a pattern we usually see here on a friday night people doing stupid things and paying the consequences
7920019 the potential impact of climate change on annual and seasonal mortality for three cities in quebec canada
7920020 is the most common cause of nonfatal injury to women in north america
7920021 canadian health care we so envy lies in ruins its architect admits
7920022 we thought we could resolve the systems problems by rationing services or injecting massive amounts of new money into it
7920023 we are proposing to give a greater role to the private sector so that people can exercise freedom of choice
7920024 it would be safe to say that im leaning toward that
7920025 s ome responsible media outlets did attempt to educate readers viewers or listeners but many treated the dispute as entertainment

7920027 in relation to the election result thats immaterial to me
7920028 my role is to ensure that the abcc carries out its functions in accordance with the act
7920029 for us its just business as usual the act is the same as the one it was before the election well make sure the act is enforced
7920030 all the indicators point in the right direction industrial action is down productivity is up and projects are completed on time and within budget
7920031 the powers we have have been effective in changing the conduct in the industry
7920032 i dont accept the description of the abcc as secret police
7920033 they are both going to do what they have to do
7920034 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7920035 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7920036 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7920037 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7920038 esa gran noticia no la esper bamos creo que quienes residimos en arlington tenemos muchas cosas por las que sentirnos orgullosos entre ellas una excelente combinaci n de poblaci n y sus estilos de vida que hacen rico al condado
7920039 por un lado a adi tejada se puede decir que estamos sorprendidos pero por el otro sabemos que nuestro enfoque de ser inclusivos hace atraer a las personas de otras reas
7920040 donde un tercio de los adultos del condado tiene t tulos universitarios y acceso a trabajos que son altamente remunerados en la regi n ya sea en bufetes de abogados en el gobierno o en centros de investigaci n
7920041 estos factores tambi n son resaltados en la actual campa a piensa a arlington organizado por el centro de desarrollo econ mico de arlington aed por sus siglas en ingl s el cual promueve el poder del cerebro como energ a alternativa de arlington
7920042 la noci n de arlington como un centro de riqueza nacional y un lugar en el cual los beneficios de una poblaci n altamente educada y bien pagada estuvo en los or genes de nuestra campa a piensa arlington que hemos puesto en marcha
7920043 queremos destacar a las personas a las compa as de negocios y de entretenimiento que hacen de arlington un lugar muy cotizado para vivir y trabajar

7920046 american families want change and the women of the united states senate are committed to helping deliver it for them
7920047 women play such an important role in our democracy in our families and in our communities
7920048 during this convention we celebrate not only the anniversary of womens suffrage but the contributions and sacrifices theyve made on behalf of our country
7920049 as we continue on to november women will cast the deciding vote in this election as a father i am grateful to our women leaders for opening doors for my own daughters and future generations and as president i will continue to stand with women to ensure that their voices are heard in washington and beyond
7920050 cest vrai que je connais sans doute la l gislation et les projets gouvernementaux plus que le commun des mortels je les ai fait adopter
7920051 its true without a doubt i know the legislation and government initiatives better than the public
7920052 titre de ministre il a contribu mettre en place un certain nombre de d cisions qui favorisent lessor du priv deux mois apr s avoir t le parrain de ces initiatives il se place dans une situation o il va pouvoir en profiter personnellement estime le porte parole du parti qu b cois en sant bernard drainville la d cision quil a pris ne respecte pas lesprit de la loi qui est de sassurer que quelquun qui a eu acc s des informations privil gi es ne sen serve pas des fins lucratives
7920053 as minister he helped make a number of decisions that furthered the development of the private sector
7920054 i find the ethical considerations of supervised injections to be profoundly disturbing
7920055 is it ethical for healthcare professionals to support the distribution of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
7920056 supporting harm reduction is not a breach of medical ethics
7920057 this guy is insulting the physicians and nurses on the frontlines
7920058 yet another disgusting example of ideology over science its disgusting he only talked one thing for the whole frickin speech
7920059 there is a refusal to acknowledge the cma knows more about this than he does
7920060 as a physician i find mr clements remarks with regard to insite extremely dangerous
7920061 what is most appalling to me however is that mr clement didnt just say that his government has a moral issue with this he then went on to lecture physicians on what is the ethical practice of medicine is this government going to decide to tell physicians how to practise medicine soon
7920062 a lawyer chastising doctors today on ethics remarkable that was a shameful performance
7920063 i think it is a bit hypocritical but at this point we need all the allies we can get
7920064 we need to work together to stop an almost neanderthal position on the part of tony clement liberals may not be prepared to enact something and put public money towards it but at least they understand the importance of it tony clement doesnt seem to understand either neither the importance of harm nor the importance of investing public money into it
7920065 in rejecting harm reduction as one tool of addiction treatment the minister is abandoning the most vulnerable members of society
7920066 it is contrary to the interests of both scientific inquiry and informed public debate to categorically reject supervised injection sites
7920067 i regret that the government of canada has adopted this position
7920068 junkies and pushers dont belong near children and families they should be in rehab or behind bars
7920069 where people who have led bad lives and die without being sorry are eternally punished
7920070 in a pluralistic post modern world students are having a more difficult time with the idea of people going to hell forever because they didnt believe the right thing
7920071 thats the biggest question out there right now would god send someone to hell if they were someone as good as me but didnt believe what i believe
7920072 i have to show trust in god and his mercy all the time always satan is circling and trying to misguide me
7920073 lets be perfectly clear failure to enact a comprehensive sustained and multipronged attack on the pandemic represents a crime a crime against those infected those affected and those susceptible indeed it represents a crime against humanity
7920074 equity and quality rather than promoting private insurance and the creation of markets for buying and selling health care
7920075 there are problems in the healthcare system but dismantling the public system is a mistake
7920076 dont let it be forgot that once there was a spot for one brief shining moment that was known as
7920077 how should i know whether or not one of my ancestors might have jumped the fence
7920078 a mean spirited son of a half breed indian squaw and a virginia mulatto father
7920079 there is something strange and even psychopathic about the lengths to which thomas jefferson went to destroy all remembrances of his mother while saving over 18 000 copies of his own letters and other documents for posterity
7920080 3 poor bloggers whose lives have been destroyed by this lawsuit because they posted comments not just once but numerous times on numerous sites and those comments contained knowingly false information about mr sinclair
7920081 poor 3 are hiding behind their anonymity in the attempt to avoid legal service and thus keep the lawsuit from being tried in the courts on its merits to this extent others have gone on viscious attacks to aid the 3 bloggers so who are these bloggers
7920082 poor 3 bloggers names actually known one should wonder why if they are so sure that they did not defame larry sinclair do they not want to get this case moving forward so that they can be heard and exonerated
7920083 john mccain when you were talking about us being in iraq for 100 years were you talking about alex the toddler because if you were you cannot have him
7920084 a con man no credibility no corroboration to the story
7920085 to be honest with you its not so much whether you believe me or not as much as you hear me
7920086 its just a ride and we can change it any time we want its only a choice no effort no work no job no savings and money a choice right now between fear and love
7920087 i dont want to anger the religious right so ill just go along with this because i think my constituents think this anyway
7920088 what in gods name are these people doing why does the religious right try to limit scientific advances when they relate to human reproduction ive come to believe that the most extreme and frequently the most influential right wing advocates seek a country that comports with their view of the bible if it was up to them they would not only outlaw abortion altogether but all forms of birth control except the rhythm method and abstinence
7920089 health is a matter of provincial jurisdiction and we want to run our health care services
7920090 way ahead of other provinces when it comes to organ donation
7920091 what we need to do is convince albertans to take some personal responsibility this is a preventable disease this is not cancer this is a preventable disease
7920092 lieperts comments came a week after the edmonton journal reported five babies died of congenital syphilis in alberta since 2005
7920093 best practices in transplanting facial hair for patients suffering from hair loss as a result of an accident or a serious burn including cultural considerations for patients who live in areas of the world where a lack of facial hair such as a moustache is considered shameful
7920094 you your joys and your sorrows your memories and your ambitions your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules who you are is nothing but a pack of neurons
7920095 although we appear to have free will in fact our choices have already been predetermined for us and we cannot change that
7920096 omg if im just a pack of neurons i have much bigger things to worry about than behaving on this experiment
7920097 such advice would provide cultural credibility and respectability to the military action
7920098 if these archaeologists had little impact in terms of saving even the few selected archaeological sites listed what did they achieve
7920099 what these critics are attacking is not religion but a hasty caricature of it
7920100 a woman martyr is problematic for muslim society a man who recruits a woman is breaking islamic law
7920101 achieve a significant reduction or at least lead to a strategy to make a significant reduction in all wait lists in canada
7920102 but as it stands the canada health act is a hindrance to innovation
7920103 not for profit non partisan organization dedicated to protecting and expanding canadas public health system
7920104 the limited effect an individual can have in the course of a year
7920105 it would have been nice if he had given that as much play as supporting private healthcare and promoting private care that benefits only the doctors
7920106 why does cote divoire have 76 religions while norway has 13 and why does brazil have 159 religions while canada has 15 even though in both comparisons the countries are similar in size
7920107 if this argument is correct then across the globe religion diversity should correlate positively with infectious disease diversity
7920108 a sample of traditional societies shows that the range of those societies is lower in areas with more disease agents compared with areas with few pathogens and in countries religion diversity is positively related to two measures of stress caused by infection with parasites religion richness was positively related to disease richness and significantly so
7920109 we found that religion diversity is the highest where disease diversity is also the highest and the lowest where disease diversity is also the lowest to our knowledge previous evolutionary models do not offer an explanation for why religion diversity varies spatially across the globe
7920110 darwinian evolution tells us not only where we came from but also what behavior is natural and normative for humans teach kids they are animals and theyll act like animals

7920129 at the human level i think one has to feel relief for mr golubchuk because he was not in a vegetative state but in a near vegetative state he was feeling pain and discomfort but on the other hand we wont have a court ruling that will clarify the situation
7920130 the most insensitive hypocritical unfeeling document i have ever read
7920131 that is a precedent there are no others in this kind of case so people who are faced with what samuel golubchuks family was faced with they know there is something to rely on in the future
7920132 i dont want to change the world but at least to have some little influence and to show that there are some solutions that we have that are working

7920134 for us its very refreshing that we see that someone is taking action
7920135 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is the opposite we believe it is a form of harm addition
7920136 i believe im on the side of compassion and on the side of the angels
7920137 what is it about safe injection sites that clement cannot get his mind around
7920138 he understands and endorses the need for clean needles the sites merely add a desk and chair and health care oversight to the mix
7920139 whats more clement is proving himself a first class hypocrite
7920140 b c s government has pledged 2 4 million annually for the crossing at keremeos to begin accepting residents in january so far the feds have contributed zip
7920141 its time for clement to put his money where his mouth is
7920142 how can any credibility be given to any funding pledge by the canadian government when it hasnt even honoured long standing domestic commitments
7920143 this is another clear indicator of the ontario ministry of health and long term cares discrimination based on disease type

7920154 with the start of the olympics in beijing much has been made about the poor air quality in china and the effect it is having on our athletes but we have a serious home grown pollution problem right here and canadians ranging from the very young to the very old are paying the price
7920155 the data from the national illness cost of air pollution study is clear we need concrete and real action on air pollution and a national action plan on lung health

7920187 that may be the real message of obamas ascent his aides insist that he has emerged not because they have mastered new technology but because he has inspired so many people thats difficult to dispute but it misses the interaction between inspiration and innovation whats happening is that the growth of internet technology is multiplying the reward for candidates who can arouse the kind of passion that obama has gary hart generated a lot of excitement in the 1984 democratic race but without the internet to magnify and spread it he fell short today a candidate who sparks such enthusiasm can more easily convert it into tangible assistance with fundraising and outreach to voters such activism of course isnt a guarantee of victory in the primaries or the general election but the ability to inspire large numbers of supporters is likely to become an increasingly powerful force in presidential politics helping to determine which candidates rise or fall in much the same way that the ability to perform on television or to raise big dollar donations has done for the past half century

7920304 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive

7920339 burden of proving inequitable conduct lies with the accused infringer the patentee need not offer any good faith explanation unless the accused infringer first carried his burden to prove a threshold level of intent to deceive and materiality by clear and convincing evidence

7920341 the need to strictly enforce the burden of proof and elevated standard of proof in the inequitable conduct context is paramount because the penalty for inequitable conduct is so severe the loss of the entire patent even where every claim clearly meets every requirement of patentability
7920342 rather to prevail on the defense the accused infringer must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the material information was withheld with the specific intent to deceive the pto

7920346 rjr failed to elicit any testimony or submit any other evidence indicating that star knew what the burton letter said prior to replacing the sughrue firm or that the letter was a reason for changing firms

7920396 because of this all of the jews their prophets and sages yearn for the days of mashiach

7920399 one should not live in a city where the market day is on shabbat as it is impossible not to sin
7920400 even if there were to be two jewish states and one of them has better deeds and is more precise in their performance of mitzvot than the other a g d fearing person is obliged to leave the city whose actions are worse and move to the superior city this is true even when there are two jewish states but if the place is amongst non jews how much more so that a jew who lives there is obligated to leave and go to a good place i e to the only jewish state as david said for you have exiled me today from being in the inheritance of hashem saying go and serve other gods 13 from here we see that living amongst non jews is considered as serving other gods
7920401 for the torah will go out from zion and the word of hashem from yerushalayim
7920402 for if i knew that it is correct i would be disgusted with my honor and abandon my high post 16 leave my family and hasten over the mountains oceans and dry land until i arrived to your kingdom
7920403 one should always live in the land of israel even in a city which is mainly idolaters and should not live outside of israel even in a city which is mainly jews
7920404 for you have exiled me saying go and serve other gods

7920412 while new rustavi is dominated by a multitude of seemingly endless stretch of depressing soviet era block apartments
7920413 the fall of the soviet union in 1999 proved disastrous for rustavi as it also caused the collapse of the integrated soviet economy on which the city depended today most of its industrial plants have been shut down
7920414 and 65 of the citys population is unemployed with all of the attendant social problems of high crime and acute poverty that such a situation brings the population shrank from 160 000 in the mid 1990s as residents moved elsewhere in search of work

7920440 when people start to meditate or to work with any kind of spiritual discipline they often think that somehow theyre going to improve which is a sort of subtle aggression against who they really are

7920442 if i could meditate and calm down id be a better person
7920443 but loving kindness toward ourselves doesnt mean getting rid of anything it means that we can still be crazy after all these years we can still be angry after all these years we can still be timid or jealous or full of feelings of unworthiness the point is not to try to change ourselves meditation practice isnt about trying to throw ourselves away and become something better its about befriending who we are already the ground of practice is you or me or whoever we are right now just as we are thats the ground thats what we study thats what we come to know with tremendous curiosity and interest

7920470 the rts has fallen more than 37 since its recent peak in mid may but there is no certainty that we have seen the bottom yet much will depend on the kremlins rhetoric

7920472 with a crack in its lead customer we believe marvells positioning at its other customers is all that more important
7920473 despite a competitors recent downgrade we continue to think shares offer compelling upside at current levels and we would be buyers of marvell on any related weakness today
7920474 not to minimize freescales successful efforts but we still think there is plenty of room for marvell to feed at the blackberry trough
7920475 we believe marvells unit shipments to research in motion could grow by 60 80 this year

7920478 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level

7920483 it is well known that there are a number of outstanding issues arising from the st andrews agreement which need to be resolved
7920484 in june this year in downing street the dup committed themselves to entering into a period of intensive dialogue with sinn f in to resolve these issues
7920485 this process of intensive engagement has not materialised satisfactorily now that mr robinson has returned from his holidays it is vital that he brings a focus to the dup approach and that the process necessary to resolve outstanding issues now finally gets under way in a serious way
7920486 if this happens and the necessary political will is demonstrated then i am convinced that progress can be achieved and outstanding issues effectively addressed
7920487 when ministers were appointed they made public and legally binding pledges which are not being fulfilled
7920488 this cannot continue a meeting of the executive has been scheduled for september 18
7920489 if this meeting were not to take place it is self evident that there would be serious consequences for the good government of northern ireland and indeed potentially for those who refuse to fulfil their legal obligations
7920490 let me make it clear the dup will not respond to threats such as that which sinn f in has made
7920491 if we were to do so on this issue we would be vulnerable to having the republican threat of bringing the institutions down used again and again in order that we would comply with other sinn f in demands
7920492 nor indeed will we make political concessions in order to encourage any party to do that which it pledged to do and carry out duties which it is legally required to perform
7920493 firstly it should be said that a politician from the republic has no business making threats relating to the parliament of another country
7920494 mr ocaolains views are provocative to say the least if his view is shared by the deputy first minister then the people of northern ireland have a right to know that a crisis is coming
7920495 they are threatening each other with collapse or consequences while failing to convene the executive to address the consequences of the collapse in economic confidence
7920496 rather than playing tug of war over the timing and terms for devolving policing and justice all parties should be pulling together to maximise democratic responsibility all parties should unite to confound the sinister agenda of republican dissidents
7920497 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7920498 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect

7920507 from the start of the season we are always under pressure always
7920508 i think its important to say to the players listen we have to play well we have to improve
7920509 if we play well score goals and win some games in a row we can talk about titles but for me at the moment the main thing for me is to improve the game
7920510 everyone knows how important it is for our season to get into the group stage
7920511 you have to bear in mind this is probably the biggest game of the season already and in some cases it may be the most important match theyve ever had in their career
7920512 it would be unthinkable for us not to be in the champions league you just want to get this qualifier out the way put europe on the backburner for a while and get focused for a couple of months on doing well in the league
7920513 we were scoring a lot of goals at the end of the pre season so i was really pleased but we havent played well the last three games
7920514 we have to improve in set pieces we have to improve in open play it was a bad game in belgium the best thing was the result
7920515 now we have to improve we have to play better and we have to score goals

7920520 green individuals are a little less trusting and will investigate companies to see if they are greenwashing
7920521 for a company to be effective in this green space transparency is key
7920522 they think something such as recycling allows them to say they are a green company where its really just a first step in an overall process toward becoming more environmentally friendly
7920523 green is not a marketing pr or advertising tactic its a lifestyle for many consumers they expect companies to understand that and support their lifestyle with products and services they can believe in
7920524 while industry suppliers are advertising eco friendly products left and right on occasion those products are not as eco friendly as they seem
7920525 if a promotional products distributor needs to tactfully make their clients aware of what it means to be green there is research and expertise to support the position
7920526 sometimes it is easier to bring in an outside expert
7920527 it is critical for both the distributor and the client to collaborate or consult with an outside expert who is familiar with this marketplace if they are not an expert
7920528 its a tough marketplace to navigate and its less forgiving than a traditional marketplace plus the ways you communicate the vehicles you use to communicate and the market are much different

7920573 when we began planning ie8 we took a hard look at our customers concerns about privacy on the web
7920574 many users are concerned about so called over the shoulder privacy or the ability to control what their spouses friends kids and co workers might see
7920575 if you are using a shared pc a borrowed laptop from a friend or a public pc sometimes you dont want other people to know where youve been
7920576 you know as well as i do this feature is built for porn
7920577 to lock everyone into aporn bucket makes people who have alternate privacy needs think that theyre doing something wrong
7920578 we want users to not only be able to enter a private browsing session but tell the browser that they want to delete all evidence starting a couple of hours ago
7920579 the key part is getting privacy tools into the browser
7920580 rather than as add ons or extensions microsofts announcement is significant not because its a major technological breakthrough but because its a breakthrough into making it easier for users to have real control over their privacy
7920581 but well have to wait to see how easy it is to use
7920582 what were seeing in firefox is that people want their browsers to remember more not less

7920595 women minorities and postdocs in engineering and sciences believe a wide range of mentoring activities is important to their academic success
7920596 students seek mentors who are non threatening and encouraging role models who offer advice who respect them as individuals and who help them overcome challenges
7920597 in this increasingly technologized age we need to develop and retain all the talent we can in engineering and the sciences one of the proven methods for doing so is to match students with professionals in a sustained mentoring relationship by finding mentors in our partner corporations and matching them with women and minorities we are filling a crucial gap in the careers of worthy students and enlarging the talent pool in these crucial disciplines

7920889 while companies have streamlined their factory floors and operations as the credit crunch continues to hit hard few have dared to put sales and marketing under the same scrutiny usually for fear of what they might find however in the vast majority of sectors there is a huge amount of waste in marketing which few companies have even noticed let alone tried to address
7920890 it seems that half of what marketing professionals do is hugely wasteful for example a paltry two to three per cent response on a direct mail campaign is seen as successful and a one in twenty conversion rate in telesales is seen as phenomenal many advertising campaigns are based on the drip effect and despite an enthusiastic launch most websites are rarely updated and often under promoted to compound the issue most marketing and salespeople are driven measured and even incentivised by sales volume not profit volume
7920891 the surprisingly simple answer is to cut all the marketing mumbo jumbo down to three key processes finding customers winning customers and growing customers
7920892 in the vast majority of cases sales and marketing processes are both ineffective and inefficient to maximise results however the detox exercise is much more than simple cost cutting you must be skilled in mapping and re engineering techniques and have the people skills to ensure that the team buys into the new approach owns the new approach and continues to improve the new approach but when you get it right you will be stunned by the results

7920908 you burn like the sun girl i couldnt not look for you my tardis just started off in your direction without so much as a by your leave wasnt till we found you that i realised that you didnt know i was going to leave you be but you ran not from me but to me you were calling out for someone to find you and you didnt even know it how could i ignore that turn away all that loneliness after so long on my own

7921212 the trip will put the bush administrations most prominent hawk in a war zone still occupied by lingering russian troops and is likely to irritate leaders in moscow who have condemned the united states for siding with georgia in the conflict
7921213 it will also underscore the extent of disagreement within the bush administration over how forcefully to confront moscow cheney and his aides unsuccessfully argued in favor of increasing military aid to the fledgling georgian democracy according to officials familiar with the debate
7921214 cheneys visit is likely be watched closely in part because he is widely seen as a representative of the bush administrations most hawkish tendencies during a trip to lithuania in may 2006 cheney
7921215 andrew kuchins director of the russia and eurasia program at the center for strategic and international studies said cheneys visit will probably amplify the mixed messages coming from washington over the georgian crisis
7921216 while bush and others from both parties have railed against russia for its actions the official u s response has been limited primarily to diplomatic efforts and humanitarian aid the pentagon has explicitly ruled out a military confrontation with russia

7921248 and we havent yet so were gonna find out because were gonna pound it and the only way of finding out is to get the big boys up front to come off the ball and hand it off to those backs because i like all of them i like all the backs
7921249 keep fresh legs out there and keep pounding it and that will help everything get better it will help the play action pass it will help guys get open in intermediate routes and it will help pass protection because people have to worry about stopping the run first

7921251 obviously i have a lot to learn from someone that went through it last year were both very different so we can learn from each other in that sense

7921395 sickened by sun with rainstorms lashing him rotten a looted wreath crowning his tangled hair every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten gone the roof overhead but the sky was always there oh you who are flung out alike from heaven and from hades you murderers whove been so bitterly repaid why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies it was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans though his mother has given him up for lost grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition always in search of that land where life seems best loafing through hells and flocked through paradises calm and grinning with a vanishing face at times he still dreams of a small field he recognises with a blue sky overhead and nothing else

7921439 your not gonna believe this but the brake pedal is lying on the floor it fell off dude
7921440 tony obviously came in with a lot more racing experience in a lot of different series
7921441 but you go back and look at how much joey has done and its kind of amazing that he can have the amount of experience that he has for someone whos only 18
7921442 i know this is crazy but there is no reason in my mind why we cant go out and put ourselves in position to win a couple of races next year whether we can close the deal and all that well you know how hard it is in this sport but obviously were going to set our goals and one of them will be to make the chase thats what this sport is all about its about being consistent if we can do that week in and week out and make the least amount of mistakes i think well be able to overcome some of the learning curve for joey and myself and have a successful season
7921443 hes the boss that sounds like a good plan so well stick with that
7921444 hes mature for his age when he wants to be
7921445 hes a happy go lucky kid im sure there will be some bumps and bruises along the way but hes always been able to deal with that
7921446 different people mature at different rates he just stepped to the plate as he has all his life ahead of schedule
7921447 were in a world now where you have a 72 year old running for president and you have 18 and 19 year old young men and women fighting wars
7921448 i kind of dont like the notion of joey as the kid i think what we see in joey is a mature young man who has the values the work ethic and the competence you look at what joey has done already behind the wheel of a car and that certainly gives us comfort going forward that he can deal with the pros
7921449 when you have an association the way i think we do at home depot with joe gibbs racing you have shared accountabilities and specific responsibilities
7921450 when coach and team president j d gibbs joes son come to us and say they think they have a driver worthy of getting into the no 20 car theyre the experts were not were going to defer to their judgment
7921451 certainly we had robust discussions about it but after meeting with joey and his parents and seeing what he can do and the type of individual and young man he is we know joey has championship caliber dna
7921452 he was in a eight horsepower go kart at age 4 running around the dumpsters and trailer trucks that i owned up there
7921453 we knew he was having fun and doing some things but i never followed racing im not a racer i was a baseball coach well i was his t ball coach and his basketball coach he hated it he wanted no part of that but he loved that go kart
7921454 we put him in a quarter midget and we knew he was above average
7921455 so i feel im ready for this there are still times where i can be a kid but what do i do i usually go go kart racing with my friends or something like that
7921456 i wouldnt like to be acting for the indian parents
7921457 you might get pro bono lawyers but the bottom line would be the best interests of the child and that may be a one way street if you compared the position of the child in australia returning to poverty in india you would have to be a pretty dramatic judge to send a child back to the slums
7921458 the thing that got to me the most was that so much scrutiny was paid to the parents here in australia who wanted to adopt but very few checks seemed to have been done into the source of the children
7921459 ive been afraid of changes because ive built my life around you
7921460 the good thing about the metro in new york is that its an all class establishment unlike los angeles residing in chelsea and union square seeing the youth of america dance all night to an all knowing all understanding union down at washington square park and seeing more beautiful boys than i have ever seen in my life due to the unending population of tourists i try to avoid times square although i have to walk through there i already got ripped off by some gypsies what is it with me and the gypsies the weekend consists of trucking down to greenwhich as well as soho east coaster art flows shows big with the flourescents consistent in my dominating force of contempoire
7921461 the bottom line is look different conventions different people speak speaking is not important winning is important
7921462 were all very very much plugged in there shouldnt be any mistake in any peoples minds that sen obama is going to be in new jersey the day after the republican convention hes looking to make sure that theres a statement in one of the most important media markets in one of the most important voting bases for the democratic party and he wants to be there youre making something out of nothing
7921463 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
7921464 lay it all on me i will take your sins i will give you peace banish no longer your self respect for i have bought you with the price of my own blood you are mine your weakened will i will strengthen your remorse for sin i will remove
7921465 the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin
7921466 go thy way for this time when i have a convenient season i will the person who is drawn again and again by his redeemer and who slights the warnings given yields not to his convictions to repent and heeds not when he is exhorted to seek pardon and grace is in a perilous position
7921467 wake up wake up wake up wake up dont be afraid
7921468 ronks delicate nuanced renderings are exquisitely crafted and demand careful attention
7921469 voglio che voi riconosciate che questa e la vostra vita le rocce sono le cose importanti la famiglia il partner la salute i figli lamicizia anche se ogni altra cosa dovesse mancare e solo queste rimanere la vostra vita sarebbe comunque piena i sassolini sono le altre cose che contano come il lavoro la casa la moto lauto la sabbia rappresenta qualsiasi altra cosa le piccole cose se voi riempite il vaso prima con la sabbia non ci sar pi spazio per rocce e sassolini lo stesso e per la vostra vita se voi spendete tutto il vostro tempo ed energie per le piccole cose non avrete mai spazio per le cose veramente importanti stabilite le vostre priorit e dedicate pi tempo alle cose importanti il resto e solo sabbia
7921470 not positive in the sense of providing more job opportunities to those who get their kicks having sex in front of lights and cameras but positive to society in general
7921471 consider that the amount of pornography has exploded with the onset of the internet age and sexual assaults in canada have plunged dramatically over the last 15 years
7921472 the arrival of northern peaks is nothing to dread the worst emotion it should invoke in the rest of us is apathy
7921473 it has the vast potential to undermine the way the internet does business
7921474 this type of association is found in several studies that show that there are carcinogens in incense smoke and it carries significant health implications
7921475 the federal authorities will hopefully back off a little if people follow these guidelines
7921476 there have been a number of abuses in the past hopefully these guidelines will help remove opportunities for illegal activity
7921477 really i wanted to go to that or get that done buy then why didnt someone tell me
7921478 look at their face they dont care about a dam thing your saying
7921479 they dont know you and even if they did they wouldnt care
7921480 hey as long as you can act then you can sing too
7921481 ahora tenemos todo un pasado por delante para reconocer a todas las mujeres que como juana azurduy salieron a dar pelea por un pa s mas justo para todos y todas
7921482 es importante mostrar la rebeld a de una mujer en contraposici n con julio roca que representa la crueldad de quienes aniquilaron comunidades enteras con el objetivo de extender el crecimiento del pa s
7921483 terminemos la figura de un genocida con la de una mujer que representa a cualquiera que se resista a la dominaci n y la violencia
7921484 nosotras observamos que el gobierno bonaerense una indiferencia para trabajar en estos temas por eso empezamos a trabajar con mucha m s fuerza ya que nosotros no queremos ser c mplice de eso evidentemente el rol de la mujer en la provincia queda postergado y creemos que en pol tica tiene que existir mucho m s participaci n de la mujer
7921485 well if this party has a message it has done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight i promise you that
7921486 right now like i say we are playing hide the message pretty good
7921487 theres no message coming out of here there is no sense that the party has a sense of urgency and weve only got four nights this is 25 of the whole thing
7921488 what we set out to do last night i think was accomplished in a very very big way
7921489 tell james to get a good seat and stay tuned
7921490 its a four day convention you know so stay tuned its only tuesday
7921491 our medical personnel know from experience that service members are ruled medically nondeployable for reasons such as requisitioning a second pair of eyeglasses bringing dental records up to date and filling dental cavities
7921492 were there some mistakes made yes some soldiers should not have gone and did
7921493 my understanding is the majority of the soldiers not all of them once they got over there and realized they couldnt give them the care they needed they were sent home
7921494 i have a herniated disc in my neck and the army docs said i was fine
7921495 i know they sent us over here hurt so they could keep the numbers up
7921496 well have some units entire units that have served four tours over there
7921497 those are the kinds of things that at least scare me and they should be scaring mental health professionals and the department of veterans affairs and the department of defense
7921498 we do know at least from the research that has been done the more a person is exposed to those traumatic events and for longer periods of time there are real problems
7921499 this is the first time weve really had to deal with that
7921500 equitability is so keen and essential to making sure were taking care of our force
7921501 the increasing need for able warfighters has meant longer and multiple deployments for its soldiers
7921502 in any military plane youre supposed to be wearing your kevlar helmet
7921503 i had it on once for like five minutes and sgt
7921504 i went into her office she said youre good to go she stamped the paperwork
7921505 the chain of command wanted to send me to iraq to get my treatment there they thought i could get enough treatment in theater
7921506 they told me to get ready to go they were getting ready to give my weapon back to me
7921507 we cant be relied upon to do our job were taking up someone elses time watching us to make sure were ok someone has to do that when they could be doing something else
7921508 look this soldiers not going to iraq theres no way
7921509 they need people is what was told to rear detachment send me people
7921510 i had to take out all my plates but two
7921511 no ammunition no water i had other people carrying my gear for me soldiers we help each other out
7921512 my first sergeant gave up his own 9mm pistol so i wouldnt be breaking a profile
7921513 he was released from the hospital into the loving arms of the government who sent him directly back to iraq
7921514 he was put on active duty while he was still on a liquid diet unable to eat solid food because of a throat hemorrhage due to a botched surgery at a military hospital
7921515 basically the only gear he can wear out of his combat gear is his helmet
7921516 after a couple of minutes it feels like a 100 pound weight on his chest he cant breathe
7921517 theyre trying to fill their quotas they dont care about lives they care about bodies
7921518 so when they got moved to the left were there problems getting them yes there were because the system never caught up
7921519 our goal was 95 percent we went through with 87
7921520 as the army starts backfilling everyone else over the last six months we have received over 500 soldiers again its just a goal that commanders have if you dont reach it you dont reach it
7921521 we have been having issues with reaching deployable strength and thus have been taking along some borderline soldiers who we would otherwise have left behind for continued treatment
7921522 theyre sending units so rapidly theyre having trouble getting them healthy
7921523 no initial indication that the units deliberately deployed medically unfit soldiers against explicit medical advice
7921524 the term medical no go is unclear and as witnessed by recent public media interest can easily be misunderstood
7921525 very good competent commanders that i think are doing a tremendous job and they work closely with the medical care providers and ill tell you i dont think there is any evil here these are americas sons and daughters and we dont put people in command who dont take that responsibility quite seriously
7921526 war is hard and there is no doubt you can see the army is working hard to get back to 12 month deployments from 15 months because we know this is tough on our soldiers and families too it is very hard
7921527 with his profile he was not supposed to go he stops breathing
7921528 he has a machine that goes over his face to help him breathe at night if his machine breaks down they have to send it back to the states to fix it he does have a backup but how long is that going to last
7921529 you promised me lord that if i followed you you would walk with me always but i have noticed that during the most trying periods of my life there has only been one set of footprints in the sand why when i needed you most have you not been there for me
7921530 do i have to know your faults if im to say that i love you

7921532 afghan society has started to make progress in its fight against opium
7921533 if helmand were a country it would once again be the worlds biggest producer of illicit drugs
7921534 theres no other way of putting it this attack is sick
7921535 hackers have no qualms about exploiting a familys natural instinct to defend its most vulnerable members hopefully people will pause before opening the attachment but the reflex action of some may be to click first and think later
7921536 theater providers often send lab specimens from their patients to landstuhl for testing and then have to wait to receive results by fax telephone or mail
7921537 with this planned capability test results can be viewed by the providers in theater through tmds this new capability will significantly improve turnaround time for critical laboratory results
7921538 when this capability is fully operational a patients health data captured within the mhs electronic health record system will be accessible to theater providers
7921539 this will enhance patient safety and the continuity of care for deployed service members
7921540 tengamos que pensar que va a haber otros aumentos de precios
7921541 ya en algunas regiones se ha materializado el aumento como por ejemplo en mar del plata y ahora va a seguir en otras regiones
7921542 en realidad el problema m s grave es que el crudo no baja y es un motivo de preocupaci n de todos porque los valores seguramente se van a incrementar
7921543 es permanente como tambi n la indeferencia de la autoridad p blica
7921544 ac no solamente hay que censurar la conducta de las petroleras que son los nicos culpables sino de la autoridad p blica que debe intervenir porque perjudica a todos comerciantes y clientes
7921545 estamos en una etapa disuasiva de las autoridades provinciales y comunales
7921546 nuestra intervenci n se limita a cerrar ese eslogan de que
7921547 en este tipo de cuestiones no deben intervenir las cuestiones pol ticas porque se trata de algo a favor de la vida y todos tenemos la obligaci n moral de colaborar con ese nimo firmamos el convenio
7921548 teoria mea teoria mea este ca e mai bine sa mori cata vreme nu ti a luat viata totul trebuie sa pastrezi munitii energie pentru moarte si sa nu ajungi acolo complet golit ca batranii astia acriti si nefericiti
7921549 exista o cenzura impotriva sinuciderii politica religioasa sociala chiar si naturala caci doamnei naturi nu i place ca cineva sa si aroge drepturi in privinta ei vrea sa ne tina in lesa pana la capat vrea sa hotarasca in locul nostru cine hotareste moartea oamenilor am delegat aceasta libertate suprema bolii accidentelor crimei asta se numeste hazard dar e fals acest hazard este vointa subtila a societatii care incet incet ne otraveste prin poluare ne masacreaza prin razboaie si accidente societatea hotareste astfel data mortii noastre prin calitatea alimentatiei periculozitatea ambientului cotidian a conditiilor noastre de munca si de viata noi nu alegem sa traim nu ne alegem limba tara epoca gusturile nu ne alegem viata singura libertate este moartea a fi liber inseamna sa mori
7921550 daca va aflati aici este pentru ca si voi aveti fara indoiala cancere organice sau cancere la suflet tumori sentimentale leucemii amoroase si metastaze sociale care va rod si ele sunt cele care ne dicteaza optiunea cu mult inainte de orice idee mareata despre libertatea noastra sa fim sinceri daca am fi sanatosi daca am fi iubiti asa cum meritam luati in seama cu un loc bun la soare in societate sunt sigura ca aceasta sala ar fi goala
7921551 cei care cred ca inteligenta are vreo noblete cu siguranta ca n au destula pentru a si da seama ca nu e decat un blestem
7921552 inteligenta este un rateu al evolutiei imi imaginez perfect pe vremea primilor oameni preistorici in sanul unui mic trib toti copiii alergand prin hatisuri fugarind soparle culegand fructe pentru cina treptat in contact cu adultii invatand sa devina barbati si femei desavarsiti vanatori culegatori pescari tabacari dar privind mai atent viata acestui trib observ ca unii copii nu participa la activitatile grupului raman asezati langa foc la adapost in interiorul pesterii ei nu vor sti niciodata sa se apere in fata tigrilor cu dinti de sabie nici sa vaneze lasati singuri nu ar supravietui nici o singura noapte daca isi petrec zilele nefacand nimic nu e din lene nu si ar dori sa zburde cu camarazii lor dar nu pot natura aducandu i pe lume a dat un rateu
7921553 a incerca sa intelegi este o sinucidere sociala inseamna sa nu mai gusti viata fara sa te simti in pofida vointei tale ca o pasare de prada si totodata devoratoare de cadravre care isi sfarteca obiectele de studiu de multe ori ucizi ceea ce vrei sa intelegi caci asemeni medicului ucenic nu exista cunoastere adevarata fara disectie descoperi venele si circulatia sangelui organizarea scheletului nervii functionarea intima a corpului
7921554 pentru a traduce acest lucru in limbaj matematic discutiile pe baza de generalitati sunt adunari operatii simple care prin caracterul lor evident te fac sa crezi in pertinenta lor in vreme ce o discutie serioasa ar semana mai degraba cu o serie de inecuatii cu mai multe necunoscute de integrale si de jonglari cu numere complexe
7921555 iti propun sa le inlocuim cu partide din alt joc pe care l am descoperit datorita vecinilor mei se cheama monopoly scopul jocului e simplu trebuie sa castigi bani sa fii abil sa te comporti ca un bun capitalist imbecil este fascinant o virtute a acestui joc este ca el ar trebui sa ma invete si poate chiar sa ma converteasca prin latura sa ludica la morala liberala voi adera la ceea ce astazi condamn ca un simplu joc fara sa ma preocupe consecintele chiriilor mult prea mari care arunca atatea familii in strada
7921556 faptul de a fi idiot aduce mult mai multa placere decat acela de a trai sub jugul inteligentei asa esti mult mai fericit e cert nu va trebui sa pastrez sensul prostiei ci elementele benefice care inoata prin ea ca niste oligo elemente fericirea o anumita detasare capacitatea de a nu suferi de empatia mea o lejeritate in viata in spirit lipsa de griji
7921557 cum publicitarea era o lezare a libertatii o lovitura de stat aplicata consumatorului imaginarului si inconstientului acestuia isi facuse un caiet cu numele tuturor marcilor si produselor care participau la acest razboi psihologic si nu le accepta in cosul lui de cumparaturi
7921558 viata este un animal care se hraneste cu cecuri si cu carti de credit
7921559 cand constati ca esti unul dintre putinii care mai respecta niste principii morale in raporturile umane poate fi tentant sa cazi in amoralitate nu din convingere sau de placere ci pur si simplu pentru a nu mai suferi caci nu exista durere mai mare decat sa fie un inger in iad in timp ce un diavol este oriunde la el acasa
7921560 banii succesul integrarea intr un mediu recunoscut ca avand baze solide toti acesti factori contribuie la o economisire de sine nu mai ai nevoie sa te gandesti la dorintele tale la morala ta la actele tale la prietenii tai la viata ta nu mai ai nevoie sa intelegi sa cauti mediul iti ofera toate astea la cheie
7921561 pentru cei care sunt perfect integrati in societate nu exista decat un singur anotimp o vara vesnica care le bronzeaza spiritul sub un soare care nu apune peste somnul lor au vise in care nu e niciodata noapte
7921562 de ce nu mai ai prieteni au mucegait nu remarcasem ca au o data de expirare trebuie sa fii atent la asta prietenii mei au inceput sa aiba urme de putregai pete verzi destul de scarboase ceea ce spuneau incepea sa miroase rau
7921563 teoria mea este ca poti sa intelegi si poti sa judeci judecam tocmai pentru a ne proteja fiindca pe noi cine incearca sa ne inteleaga cine ii intelege pe cei care incearca sa inteleaga

7921565 we shall rely on computational approaches increasingly to guide our choice of systems to study experimentally
7921566 at the ould lammas fair in ballycastle long ago i met a pretty colleen who set me heart a glow she was smiling at her daddy buying lambs from paddy roe at the ould lammas fair in ballycastle o sure i seen her home that night when the moon was shining bright from the ould lammas fair in ballycastle o chorus at the ould lammas fair boys were you ever there were you ever at the fair in ballycastle o did you treat your mary ann to some dulse and yellow man at the ould lammas fair in ballycastle o in flanders fields afar while resting from the war we drank bon sante to the flemish lassies o but the scene that haunts my memory is kissing mary ann her pouting lips all sticky from eating yellow man as we passed the silver margy and we strolled along the strand from the ould lammas fair in ballycastle o repeat chorus theres a neat little cabin on the slopes of fair knocklayde its lit by love and sunshine where the heather honeys made with the bees ever humming and the childrens joyous call resounds across the valley as the shadows fall sure i take my fiddle down and my mary smiling there brings back a happy memry of the lammas fair repeat chorus
7921567 you dont choose your family they are gods gift to you as you are to them
7921568 by the end we were giving away our winning cards as we could not face yet another extra large fries or a bigmac

7921573 youre gonna have a story when you wear this bikini or when you put this dress on youll either get love or meet a new friend or you might meet a guy
7921574 all my life i have been waiting for this moment south ossetian leader eduard kokoity told a crowd on the central square of the capital tskhinvali
7921575 we are very happy we can feel the joy said larisa working the counter of a shop near the ruined government building the smell of gunpowder hanging in the air
7921576 i am full of emotion we have waited so many years 49 year old sukhumi teacher anina kondrash said
7921577 its just a shame that we paid such a price for what we received today she said referring to the 1992 3 civil war
7921578 georgia did not understand our problems they didnt understand the abkhaz people she said
7921579 finally we have achieved our dream thank you russia a tearful old woman in the abkhaz capital sukhumi told russian television car horns sounding in the background
7921580 all my life i have been waiting for this moment amp squo amp squo south ossetian leader eduard kokoity told a crowd on the central square of the capital tskhinvali
7921581 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7921582 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
7921583 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different
7921584 colonising a continent isnt easy colonising a continent during the ice age is even harder so for early homo sapiens colonising ice age europe a new shared and flashy looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded he said
7921585 thus during hard times these larger social networks might act like a type of life insurance ensuring exchange and trade among members of the same team
7921586 the recognition of independence for south ossetia and abkhazia violates fundamental osce principles
7921587 russia should follow osce principles by respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia russia should immediately withdraw all troops from georgia and implement the ceasefire agreement the international community could not accept unilaterally established buffer zones
7921588 russia should follow osce principles by respecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia russia should immediately withdraw all troops from georgia and implement the ceasefire agreement
7921589 russias recognition of the separatist georgian is a regrettable decision
7921590 we consider that this is a regrettable decision and we reiterate our commitment to the territorial integrality of georgia
7921591 the russian decision to recognize south ossetia and abkhazia was absolutely unacceptable
7921592 this contradicts principles of territorial integrity as a fundamental right dialogue should be maintained with russia in a form to be decided at a european union summit to be held on monday
7921593 todays announcement by president dmitry medvedev that russia will recognize south ossetia and abkhazia is unjustifiable and unacceptable
7921594 i am holding talks today with international partners and will be visiting ukraine tomorrow to ensure the widest possible coalition against russian aggression in georgia
7921595 todays announcement further inflames an already tense situation in the region we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
7921596 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
7921597 this is contrary to obligations that russia has repeatedly taken on in united nations security council resolutions it does nothing to improve the prospects for peace in the caucasus
7921598 the move does not apply in an international legal framework an ethnic based balkanization of the caucasus is a serious danger for all
7921599 russia is a member of the osce and in it has committed to honor the territorial integrity of the member states this action is in contradiction total contradiction with osces principles
7921600 russias decision to recognize the rebel georgian provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states was a
7921601 medvedev now dramatically escalated the crisis between russia and the rest of the world the decision is also a deliberate violation of international law and basic principles for stability in europe
7921602 then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sake
7921603 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved
7921604 the god of abraham what about the god of abraham moses jesus and muhammad
7921605 as a practical matter how do you draw the line
7921606 i think this is really where you pull the cover off and see what youre really looking at with the aclu
7921607 this is religious bigotry its anti free speech its everything that theyre supposed to be against
7921608 the government really has no business telling anybody how they should or should not pray
7921609 and the fact that the aclu is trying to use the power of government to tell people how to pray is just an incredible invasion of freedom and it shows that they are not about freedom and liberty at all theyre about oppression and trying to stamp out religious speech
7921610 everything that is at issue here was clearly being done in 1789
7921611 sorry there is only steak salmon roast chicken for dinner and i only managed to make 3 desserts and the chocolate one did not quite turn out the way it should have
7921612 it was a success everyone loved the scrapbook they laughed and giggled and were very intrigued the best part was my daughter thought it was the best she has ever seen thanks so much for everything you helped me make a wonderful memory

7921615 under the bdm procedure individuals are asked to state their minimum selling price for a risky lottery the experimenter then draws a random number between the lowest and the highest outcome of the lottery if the price that the individual states is lower than or equal to the drawn number she receives the drawn number as her payoff otherwise she has to play the risky lottery

7921618 the knavery the horrible sinfulness and debauchery that are rampant in rome if there is a hell rome must be built on top of it for every kind of sin flourishes there
7921619 unless i am convinced by the testimony of scripture and evident reasoning i am convinced by the sacred scriptures i have cited for i believe neither solely the pope or the councils for it is often evident that they erred and often contradict one another my conscience is captured by the word of god thus i cannot and will not recant
7921620 we must exercise harsh mercy with fear and trembling in the hope that we could could save some of the jews from the flames and embers they are under gods wrath a thousand times worse then we could wish it upon them

7921631 norton the first by the grace of god emperor of the united states and protector of mexico departed this life
7921632 the people are the safeguards of their own liberties and i rely wholly on them to guard themselves they will correct any outrage upon political purity by congress if they do not now and ever then they will become the slaves of congress and its political corruption
7921633 the architect had the buildings inexpensively constructed out of lightweight rough textured no fines concrete so called because it contained no fine gravel this came from war damage commission funds which would only have paid for one similarly sized structure in brick although built to a standard design the three churches are individually detailed they are each characterized by a freestanding tower that clearly mark the building as a worship space and inside textured concrete walls enclose a tall aisle less nave that seats a congregation of up to 250 people the relationship between tower church and hall differs from parish to parish and responds to each individual site likewise the east and west ends of the churches range from being fully glazed to almost completely enclosed these features allow for a variety of light and ambience that lends each building its own distinct character spence and partners designed most of the original furnishings such as pulpits altars fonts and pews just as he did at coventry cathedral spence also commissioned leading artists and designers of the day to produce a carefully integrated decorative programme for these churches
7921634 provide a wide ranging and detailed picture of one of the most important and prolific architects active in britain in the mid twentieth century we are making a photographic survey of all spences surviving buildings and researching the context in which they were commissioned designed and built in order to round out the picture which we glean from scrutiny of the project files in the spence archive at the rcahms and other archival sources we are conducting a programme of interviews with spences former associates assistants and partners we aim to reconstruct the working practice of each of spences offices in edinburgh and in london and to establish the particular roles and responsibilities of their various members
7921635 the gorbals needs ongoing rebuilding as does spences reputation by the 70s he was under attack from traditional architects for being too modernist and from radicals for lacking a defining style
7921636 to be fair to spence he did design some great buildings recently restored to pristine condition his library at swiss cottage in north london provides a glimpse of how exciting modern architecture was when it was first built with its ribbed circular reading room it has light and grace that is rare in a concrete building its scale is also sensitive to its surroundings it is not bulky and awkward like too many of spences buildings spence is an interesting figure but attempts to re examine his work should honestly acknowledge that he built some dreadful buildings as well as some good ones

7921649 gary millers kennedy vs the machine was one of the most important things to happen in the blogosphere in the last two years
7921650 gary ive continued to enjoy reading kvm throughout the campaign youd make a great reporter and please dont take that as an insult
7921651 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
7921652 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
7921653 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
7921654 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
7921655 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
7921656 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
7921657 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
7921658 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant

7921672 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7921673 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived

que cuando el mandadero hizo su promesa a las j venes se levant la proveedora coloc los manjares delante de los comensales y todos comieron muy regaladamente despu s de esto encendieron las velas quemaron maderas olorosas e incienso y volvieron a beber y comer todas las golosinas compradas en el zoco sobre todo el mandadero que al mismo tiempo dec a versos cerrando los ojos mientras recitaba y moviendo la cabeza y de pronto se oyeron fuertes golpes en la puerta lo que no les perturb en sus placeres pero al fin la menor de las j venes se levant fue a la puerta y luego volvi y dijo bien llena va a estar nuestra mesa esta noche pues acabo de encontrar junto a la puerta a tres ahjam 1 con las barbas afeitadas y tuertos del ojo izquierdo es una coincidencia asombrosa he visto inmediatamente que eran extranjeros y deben venir del pa s de los rum cada uno es diferente pero los tres son tan rid culos de fisonom a que hacen re r si los hici semos entrar nos divertir amos con ellos y sus hermanas aceptaron diles que pueden entrar pero ent rales de que no deben hablar de lo que no les importe si no quieren o r cosas desagradables y la joven corri a la puerta muy alegre y volvi trayendo a los tres tuertos llevaban las mejillas afeitadas con unos bigotes retorcidos y tiesos y todo indicaba que pertenec an a la cofrad a de mendicantes llamados saalik 2 apenas entraron desearon la paz a la concurrencia y las j venes se quedaron de pie y los invitaron a sentarse una vez sentados los saalik miraron al mandadero y suponiendo que pertenec a a su cofrad a dijeron es un saaluk como nosotros y podr hacernos amistosa compa a pero el mozo que los hab a o do se levant de s bito los mir airadamente y exclam dejadme en paz que para nada necesito vuestro afecto y empezad por cumplir lo que ver is encima de esa puerta las doncellas estallaron de risa al o r estas palabras y se dec an vamos a divertirnos con este mozo y los saalik despu s ofrecieron manjares a los saalik que los comieron muy gustosamente y la m s joven les ofreci de beber y los saalik bebieron uno tras otro y cuando la copa estuvo en circulaci n dijo el mandadero hermanos nuestros llev is en el saco alguna historia o alguna maravillosa aventura con qu divertirnos estas palabras los estimularon y pidieron que les trajesen instrumentos y entonces la m s joven les trajo inmediatamente un pandero de mussul adornado con cascabeles un la d de irak y una flauta de persia y los tres saalik se pusieron de pie y uno cogi el pandero otro el la d y el tercero la flauta y los tres empezaron a tocar y las doncellas los acompa aban con sus cantos y el mandadero se mor a de gusto admirando la hermosa voz de aquellas mujeres en este momento volvieron a llamar a la puerta y como de costumbre acudi a abrir la m s joven de las tres doncellas y he aqu el motivo de que hubiesen llamado aquella noche el califa har n al raschid hab a salido a recorrer la ciudad para ver y escuchar por s mismo cuanto ocurriese le acompa aba su visir giafar al barmaki 3 y el porta alfanje masurur ejecutor de sus justicias el califa en estos casos acostumbraba disfrazarse de mercader y paseando por las calles hab a llegado frente a aquella casa y hab a o do los instrumentos y los ecos de la fiesta y el califa dijo al visir giafar quiero que entremos en esta casa para saber qu son esas voces y el visir giafar replic acaso sea un hatajo de borrachos y convendr a precavernos por si nos hiciesen alguna mala partida pero el califa dijo es mi voluntad entrar ah quiero que busques la forma de entrar y sorprenderlos al o r esta orden el visir contest escucho y obedezco y giafar avanz y llam a la puerta y al momento fue a abrir la m s joven de las tres hermanas cuando la joven hubo abierto la puerta el visir le dijo oh se ora m a somos mercaderes de tabaria tiber ades hace diez d as llegamos a bagdad con nuestros g neros y habitamos en el khan de los mercaderes uno de los comerciantes del khan nos ha convidado a su casa y nos ha dado de comer despu s de la comida que ha durado una hora nos ha dejado en libertad de marcharnos hemos salido pero ya era de noche y como somos extranjeros hemos perdido el camino del khan y ahora nos dirigimos fervorosamente a vuestra generosidad para que nos permit is entrar y pasar la noche aqu y alah os tendr en cuenta esta buena obra entonces la joven los mir le pareci que en efecto ten an maneras de mercaderes y un aspecto muy respetable por lo cual fue a buscar a sus dos hermanas para pedirles parecer y ellas le dijeron d jales entrar entonces fue a abrirles la puerta y le preguntaron podemos entrar con vuestro permiso y ella contest entrad y entraron el califa el visir y el porta alfanje y al verlos las j venes se pusieron de pie y les dijeron sed bien venidos y que la acogida en esta casa os sea tan amplia como amistosa sentaos oh hu spedes nuestros s lo tenemos que imponeros una condici n no habl is de lo que no os importa si no quer is o r cosas que no os gusten y ellos respondieron ciertamente que s y se sentaron y fueron invitados a beber y a que circulase entre ellos la copa despu s el califa mir a los tres saalik y se asombr mucho al ver que los tres estaban tuertos del ojo izquierdo y mir en seguida a las j venes y al advertir su hermosura y su gracia qued a n m s perplejo las doncellas siguieron conversando con los convidados invit ndoles a beber con ellas y luego presentaron un vino exquisito al califa pero ste lo rechaz diciendo soy un buen hadj 4 entonces la m s joven se levant y coloc delante de l una mesita con incrustaciones finas encima de la cual puso una taza de porcelana de china y ech en ella agua de la fuente que enfri con un pedazo de hielo y lo mezcl todo con az car y agua de rosas y despu s se lo present al califa y l acept y le dio las gracias diciendo para s ma ana tengo que recompensarla por su acci n y por todo el bien que hace las doncellas siguieron cumpliendo sus deberes de hospitalidad y sirviendo de beber pero cuando el vino produjo sus efectos la mayor de las tres hermanas se levant cogi de la mano a la proveedora y le dijo oh hermana m a lev ntate y cumplamos nuestro deber y su hermana le contest me tienes a tus rdenes entonces la m s peque a se levant tambi n y dijo a los saalik que se apartaran del centro de la sala y que fuesen a colocarse junto a las puertas quit cuanto hab a en medio del sal n y lo limpi las otras dos hermanas llamaron al mandadero y le dijeron por alah cu n poco nos ayudas cuenta que no eres un extra o sino de la casa y entonces el mozo se levant se remang la t nica y apret ndose el cintur n dijo mandad y obedecer y ellas contestaron aguarda en tu sitio y a los pocos momentos le dijo la proveedora s gueme que podr s ayudarme y la sigui fuera de la sala y vio dos perras de la especie de las perras negras que llevaban cadenas al cuello el mandadero las cogi y las llev al centro de la sala entonces la mayor de las hermanas se remang el brazo cogi un l tigo y dijo al mozo trae aqu una de esas perras y el mandadero tirando de la cadena del animal le oblig a acercarse y la perra se ech a llorar y levant la cabeza hacia la joven pero sta sin cuidarse de ello la tumb a sus pies y empez a darle latigazos en la cabeza y la perra chillaba y lloraba y la joven no la dej de azotar hasta que se le cans el brazo entonces tir el l tigo cogi a la perra en brazos la estrech contra su pecho le sec las l grimas y la bes en la cabeza que la ten a cogida entre sus manos despu s dijo al mandadero ll vatela y tr eme la otra y el mandadero trajo la otra y la joven la trat lo mismo que a la primera entonces el califa sinti que sus ojos se llenaban de l stima y que el pecho se le oprim a de tristeza y gui el ojo al visir giafar para que interrogase sobre aquello a la joven pero el visir le respondi por se as que lo mejor era callarse en seguida la mayor de las doncellas se dirigi a sus hermanas y les dijo hagamos lo que es nuestra costumbre y las otras contestaron obedecemos y entonces se subi al lecho chapeado de plata y de oro y dijo a las otras dos veamos ahora lo que sab is y la m s peque a se subi al lecho mientras que la otra se march a sus habitaciones y volvi trayendo una bolsa de raso con flecos de seda verde se detuvo delante de las j venes abri la bolsa y extrajo de ella un la d despu s se lo entreg a su hermana peque a que lo templ y se puso a ta erlo cantando estas estrofas con una voz sollozante y conmovida por piedad devolved a mis p rpados el sue o que de ellos ha huido decidme donde ha ido a parar mi raz n cuando permit que el amor penetrase en mi morada se enoj conmigo el sue o y me abandon y me preguntaban qu has hecho para verte as t que eres de los que recorren el camino recto y seguro dinos qui n te ha extraviado de ese modo y les dije no ser yo sino ella quien os responda yo s lo puedo deciros que mi sangre toda mi sangre le pertenece y siempre he de preferir verterla por ella a conservarla torpemente en m he elegido una mujer para poner en ella mis pensamientos mis pensamientos que reflejan su imagen si expulsara esa imagen se consumir an mis entra as con un fuego devorador si la vierais me disculpar ais porque el mismo alah cincel esa joya con el licor de la vida y con lo que qued de ese licor fabric la granada y las perlas y me dicen pero encuentras en el objeto amado otra cosa que l grimas penas y escasos placeres no sabes que al mirarte en el agua l mpida s lo ver s tu sombra bebes de un manantial cuya agua sacia antes de ser saboreada y yo contesto no cre is que bebiendo se ha apoderado de m la embriaguez sino s lo mirando no fue preciso m s esto bast para que el sue o huyera por siempre de mis ojos y no son las cosas pasadas las que me consumen sino solamente el pasado de ella no son las cosas amadas de que me separ las que me han puesto en este estado sino solamente la separaci n de ella podr a volver mis miradas hacia otra cuando toda mi alma est unida a su cuerpo perfumado a sus aromas de mbar y almizcle cuando acab de cantar su hermana le dijo ojal te consuele alah hermana m a pero tal aflicci n se apoder de la joven portera que se desgarr las vestiduras y cay desmayada en el suelo pero al caer como una parte de su cuerpo qued descubierta el califa vio en l huellas de latigazos y varazos y se asombr hasta el l mite del asombro la proveedora roci la cara de su hermana y luego que recobr el sentido le trajo un vestido nuevo y se lo puso entonces el califa dijo a giafar no te conmueven estas cosas no has visto se ales de golpes en el cuerpo de esa mujer yo no puedo callarme y no descansar hasta descubrir la verdad de todo esto y sobre todo esa aventura de las dos perras y el visir contest oh mi se or corona de mi cabeza recuerda la condici n que nos impusieron no hables de lo que no te importe si no quieres o r cosas que no te gusten y mientras tanto la proveedora se levant cogi el la d lo apoy en su redondo seno y se puso a cantar qu responder amos si vinieran a darnos quejas de amor qu har amos si el amor nos da ara si confi ramos a un int rprete que respondiese en nuestro nombre este int rprete no sabr a traducir todas las quejas de un coraz n enamorado y si sufrimos con paciencia y en silencio la ausencia del amado pronto nos pondr el dolor a las puertas de la muerte oh dolor para nosotros s lo hay penas y duelo las l grimas resbalan por las mejillas y t querido ausente que has huido de las miradas de mis ojos cortando los lazos que te un an a mis entra as di conservas alg n recuerdo de nuestro amor pasado una huella peque a que dure a pesar del tiempo o has olvidado con la ausencia el amor que agot mi esp ritu y me puso en tal estado de aniquilamiento y postraci n si mi sino es vivir desterrada alg n d a pedir cuentas de estos sufrimientos a alah nuestro se or al o r este canto tan triste la mayor de las doncellas se desgarr las vestiduras y cay desmayada y la proveedora se levant y le puso un vestido nuevo despu s de haber cuidado de rociarle la cara con agua para que volviese de su desmayo entonces algo repuesta se sent la joven en el lecho y dijo a su hermana te ruego que cantes m s para que podamos pagar nuestras deudas aunque s lo sea una vez y la proveedora templ de nuevo el la d y cant las siguientes estrofas hasta cu ndo durar n esta separaci n y este abandono tan cruel no sabes que a mis ojos ya no les quedan l grimas me abandonas pero no crees que rompes as la antigua amistad oh si tu objeto era despertar mis celos lo has logrado si el maldito destino siempre ayudase a los hombres amorosos las pobres mujeres no tendr an tiempo para dirigir reconvenciones a los amantes infieles a qui n me quejar para desahogar un poco mis desdichas las desdichas causadas por tu mano asesino de mi coraz n ay de m qu recurso le queda al que perdi la garant a de su cr dito c mo cobrar la deuda y la tristeza de mi coraz n dolorido crece con la locura de mi deseo hacia ti te busco tengo tus promesas pero t d nde est s oh hermanos os lego la obligaci n de vengarme del infiel que sufra padecimientos como los m os que apenas vaya a cerrar los ojos para el sue o se los abra en seguida el insomnio largamente por tu amor he sufrido las peores humillaciones deseo pues que otro en mi lugar goce las mayores satisfacciones a costa tuya hasta hoy me ha tocado padecer por su amor pero a l que de m se burla le tocar sufrir ma ana al o r esto cay desmayada otra vez la m s joven de las hermanas y su cuerpo apareci se alado por el l tigo entonces dijeron los tres saalik m s nos habr a valido no entrar en esta casa aunque hubi ramos pasado la noche sobre un mont n de escombros porque este espect culo nos apena de tal modo que acabar por destruirnos la espina dorsal entonces el califa volvi ndose hacia ellos les dijo y por qu es eso y contestaron porque nos ha emocionado mucho lo que acaba de ocurrir y el califa les pregunt de modo que no sois de casa y contestaron nada de eso el que parece serlo es ese que est a tu lado entonces exclam el mandadero por alah esta noche he entrado en esta casa por primera vez y mejor habr a sido dormir sobre un mont n de piedras entonces dijeron somos siete hombres y ellas s lo son tres mujeres preguntemos la explicaci n de lo ocurrido y si no quieren contestarnos de grado que lo hagan a la fuerza y todos se concertaron para obrar de ese modo menos el visir que les dijo cre is que vuestro prop sito es justo y honrado pensad que somos sus hu spedes nos han impuesto condiciones y debemos cumplirlas adem s he aqu que se acaba la noche y pronto ir cada uno a buscar su suerte por el camino de alah despu s gui el ojo al califa y llev ndole aparte le dijo s lo nos queda que permanecer aqu una hora te prometo que ma ana pondr entre tus manos a estas j venes y entonces les podr s preguntar su historia pero el califa rehus y dijo no tengo paciencia para aguardar a ma ana y siguieron hablando todos hasta que acabaron por preguntarse cu l de nosotros les dirigir la pregunta y algunos opinaran que eso le correspond a al mandadero a todo esto las j venes les preguntaron de qu habl is buena gente entonces el mandadero se levant se puso delante de la mayor de las tres hermanas y le dijo oh soberana m a en nombre de alah te pido y te conjuro de parte de todos los convidados que nos cuentes la historia de esas dos perras negras y por qu las has castigado tanto para llorar despu s y besarlas y dinos tambi n para que nos enteremos la causa de esas huellas de latigazos que se ven en el cuerpo de tu hermana tal es nuestra petici n y ahora que la paz sea contigo entonces la joven les pregunt a todos es cierto lo que dice este mandadero en vuestro nombre y todos excepto el visir contestaron cierto es y el visir no dijo ni una palabra entonces la joven al o r su respuesta les dijo por alah hu spedes m os acab is de ofendernos de la peor manera ya se os advirti oportunamente que si alguien hablaba de lo que no le importase oir a lo que no le hab a de gustar no os ha bastado entrar en esta casa y comeros nuestras provisiones pero no ten is vosotros la culpa sino nuestra hermana por haberos tra do y dicho esto se remang el brazo dio tres veces con el pie en el suelo y grit hola venid en seguida e inmediatamente se abri uno de los roperos cubiertos por cortinajes y aparecieron siete negros altos y robustos que bland an agudos alfanjes y la due a les dijo atad los brazos a esa gente de lengua larga y amarradlos unos a otros y ejecutada la orden dijeron los negros oh se ora nuestra oh flor oculta a las miradas de los hombres nos permites que les cortemos la cabeza y ella contest aguardad una hora que antes de degollarlos los he de interrogar para saber qui nes son entonces exclam el mandadero por alah oh se ora m a no me mates por el crimen de estos hombres todos han faltado y todos han cometido un acto criminal pero yo no por alah qu noche tan dichosa y tan agradable habr amos pasado si no hubi semos visto a estos malditos saalik porque estos saalik de mal ag ero son capaces de destruir la m s floreciente de las ciudades s lo con entrar en ella qu hermoso es el perd n del fuerte y sobre todo qu hermoso cuando se otorga al indefenso yo te conjuro por la inviolable amistad que existe entre los dos no mates al inocente por causa del culpable cuando el mandadero acab de recitar la joven se ech a re r en este momento de su narraci n schehrazada vio aproximarse la ma ana y se call discretamente 1 plural de ajami palabra con que se designa a

7921779 i had never been to america before and had no idea what the midwest would be like most of the television i watch is american but none of it is filmed anywhere near
7921780 seems a very american thing to say on the one hand to tell people they will succeed if they keep trying is admirable but it is totally unrealistic to tell a little girl she can be a top ballerina if she has no talent hard work and determination can get you far but cannot cut everything enthusiasm i decided is great if it is genuine and both cultures have something to learn about pitching it at the right level i did love the food being possessed of the sweetest tooth in the whole world meant that i was in my element with philadelphia cheese with added brown sugar and treacle did i imagine this ice cream with caramel butterscotch and chocolate poured on top and sugar cookies with extra icing it was probably just as well for both teeth and waistline that i was only there for a couple of weeks i often think about the wal mart shelves groaning with krispy kreme doughnuts little mince pies with real cream piped on top and too many cakes to count i am reaching for the jelly babies as we speak now i am back i do find i go around saying awesome and good jarb to people i am certainly going to visit america again

7921788 yes im afraid people do get rather keen but just shout
7921789 oh dont worry you just have to see it in operation a few times and then youll get it but actually fifa have just brought in a new ruling which has nuanced it a little
7921790 bloody yanks cant be trusted to do anything without us can you
7921791 this combination prevents the product from melting too quickly and allows it to be served at a higher temperature than ice cream

7921793 what a pity your creative urges werent adequately satisfied by three experiences of childbirth
7921794 you tell us not to get addicted to video games but youre addicted to the computer
7921795 what you think you can just walk away and then expect us to take you back
7921796 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
7921797 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
7921798 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
7921799 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience

7921807 i think all of us and obviously i include my own family in this we expect that when we shop that the things we buy or that we eat are going to be safe
7921808 all the suspect cases have been diagnosed with listeriosis but it is only via laboratory testing the genetic fingerprinting that we can determine if they are directly linked
7921809 i think that as theyve acted extremely responsibly after a short while the consumers will forget about it theyve got a very short memory
7921810 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
7921811 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
7921812 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
7921813 offset by higher provisions for credit losses in some of our retail portfolios lower capital markets revenues compared to record levels for the same period last year and higher expenses to support growth initiatives
7921814 what made me so angry hes three years old he was petrified he didnt want to go back to school and he didnt want to start his new school i was so worried that this was going to constantly be with him equating going to school with being paddled
7921815 i went into the principals office he gave me a chair and said hold onto the chair the paddle had holes in it then he just did three swats i was hit on my buttocks there were holes in the paddle to make it go faster it hurt very much there were definitely red marks and then swelling almost welt like markings it didnt last for more than a couple days it left me feeling very humiliated i think there were several levels of emotion physical pain mental humiliation and being a female at that age it was like there was this older man hitting me on the butt thats weird even at that age i knew it was inappropriate

7921825 dans cette situation tout d pend de nos partenaires de la communaut mondiale et de nos partenaires en occident
7921826 si les occidentaux veulent conserver de bonnes relations avec la russie ils comprendront les raisons de notre d cision
7921827 jai sign les d crets sur la reconnaissance par la russie de lind pendance de loss tie du sud et de labkhazie la russie appelle les autres etats suivre son exemple
7921828 ce nest pas un choix facile mais cest lunique option pour pr server les vies des gens
7921829 tbilissi a fait son choix dans la nuit du 7 au 8 ao t en lan ant une offensive militaire contre loss tie du sud le pr sident g orgien mikhe l saakachvili a choisi le g nocide pour atteindre ses objectifs politiques
7921830 il a ainsi fait une croix sur tous les espoirs de cohabitation pacifique des oss tes abkhazes et g orgiens dans un m me tat

7921833 la d cision du pr sident russe dmitri medvedev de reconna tre labkhazie et loss tie du sud est pour nous inacceptable
7921834 de fait elle viole lesprit et la lettre de r solutions du conseil de s curit de lonu auxquelles la russie a adh r

7921837 nous consid rons quil sagit dune d cision regrettable et nous rappelons notre attachement lint grit territoriale de la g orgie
7921838 je pense que lunion europ enne va sexprimer en ce sens dune seule voix
7921839 nous rejetons cela cat goriquement et r affirmons la souverainet et lint grit territoriale de la g orgie
7921840 cest contraire aux obligations que la russie a prises plusieurs reprises lors des r solutions du conseil de s curit et cela ne fait rien pour am liorer les perspectives de paix dans le caucase
7921841 cette d cision signifie une violation claire et d lib r e contre le droit international et les principes fondamentaux pour la stabilit en europe
7921842 la reconnaissance de lind pendance de loss tie du sud et de labkhazie viole les principes fondamentaux de losce
7921843 la russie doit suivre les principes de losce en respectant lint grit et la souverainet de la g orgie la russie doit retirer ses troupes imm diatement de g orgie et appliquer laccord de cessez le feu
7921844 losce va continuer surveiller la mise en oeuvre de cet accord de cessez le feu elle est dispos e davantage dassistance pour stabiliser la situation

7921848 now the challenge is twofold students must take these opportunities seriously and schools must use test data in making improvements to their curriculum and instructional practices
7921849 were gratified to see that our country is moving increasingly toward being a nation of college graduates
7921850 we cannot discount the role of student accountability in improving indianas sat scores
7921851 students are responsible for taking advantage of the opportunities available to them and parents must provide the essential support at home that ensures students succeed
7921852 the two girls make out hardcore rolling around in a bed it was a really hot scene

7921855 enlisted marines were worried that their combat decisions could be second guessed and that like the marines involved in the they could find themselves facing criminal charges
7921856 even more dangerous is the potential that a marine may hesitate at the critical moment when facing the enemy
7921857 we cannot fight a war like that were not taking care of our people

7921862 i feel im ready to start but whatever happens with max and i best of luck let the best man win
7921863 it makes me feel real good to be battling for a starting job because i get to be on the field again tuioti mariner said
7921864 girth has been here a long time and i can learn a lot of stuff from him
7921865 we make calls on the offensive line i never did that in high school
7921866 sitting out last year helped me mentally and helped me get bigger and stronger
7921867 max is a great guy i love talking to him he makes me better and i hope i make him better
7921868 one nice thing we have done over the course of the past year is defining what leadership is and what it really means
7921869 its not just a guy thats a good player he has to be a guy thats going to have the respect of everybody else he can say things to them and theyre going to react
7921870 hes got enough guts to get on somebody that needs it those guys have got to run that team and they have to have enough guts to say something is going on and i cant handle it so im going to get coach to handle it all the great teams that i have had have had great leadership
7921871 we dont have a whole lot of yellers on the team
7921872 but to be honest i like that im kind of into the speak softly and carry a big stick mode youre better off that way
7921873 but the captains have to have the ability and the fortitude to say the things that have to be said
7921874 before any rumors get started or this incident is blown out of proportion
7921875 quick incremental updates along with heavy user involvement are key characteristics of an emerging software development paradigm championed by a new generation of web 2 0 start ups

7921881 we moeten afwachten hoe hard de gegevens blijken te zijn
7921882 dat guantanamo bay niet deugt en dus ook geheime gevangenissen in europa niet
7921883 de regeringen hebben steeds ontkend nu blijkt dat ze hebben gelogen als de bewijzen kloppen ik ga ervan uit dat eu voorzitter duitsland nu polen en roemeni opheldering vraagt
7921884 het is bezopen dat we de vs vertellen dat ze hun kamp guantanamo moeten sluiten terwijl onze eigen regeringen eraan meewerken
7921885 dit betekent dat actie moet worden ondernomen het kan niet zo zijn dat er bewijzen liggen over zulke schendingen van mensenrechten en dat de eu er niets mee doet
7921886 we kunnen nu bevestigen dat er meerdere jaren geheime cia gevangenissen in polen en roemeni waren
7921887 your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you
7921888 however he rules only in his own sphere while she will always do so in hers
7921889 wives submit to your husbands as is fitting in the lord
7921890 man and woman have opposite separate roles he going out into the world to work compensating for the loss of eden she remaining in the home reproducing eden behind the doors of the family home
7921891 scripture perceives the family as the basis of a society where free will decisions can be made
7921892 seek to ease the way to separating women from child rearing
7921893 this is a back door to undermining freedom not strengthening it
7921894 the bible wants us to appreciate that women have more power in the traditional role than they will have in the long run if the traditional family is undercut by a legal system uninformed by scriptual wisdom
7921895 scripture speaks repeatedly of the kindness due to a stranger
7921896 immigration reform not entirely dissimilar from president bushs failed attempts
7921897 god made the earth for its own sake at the same time he didnt make it to remain forever pristine and untouched by human hands
7921898 wild ass of a man his hand against everyone and everyones hand against him
7921899 belief that jews deserve a home in the historical land of israel
7921900 if god had a vote he would cast it in favor of reminding his chosen people about the gentile nation that has evidently been chosen too as the main buttress of israels very existence
7921901 just probe your preferred candidate for his or her feelings about europe
7921902 europe is like one of those pregnancy tests you buy at the drugstore if a blue strip appears in the window thats good or bad news depending on your perspective
7921903 while society is indeed obliged it is understood that the society is composed of individuals bearing individual moral responsibility it is as ever the mentality of tumah that tells us that individuals are incapable of being relied upon to meet this responsibility
7921904 god isnt interested in letting us use the poor to boost our own sense of personal prestige
7921905 not to say the state should provide no safety net when individual generosity doesnt suffice yet in a biblical america the emphasis should be decidedly on people helping others through their own free choice
7921906 the biblical version of society is inclined toward freedom while the secular version inclines toward making decisions for us in other words toward tyranny
7921907 american culture is suffused with fears of illness in this hypochondriacal environment the intensive politicization of health care was inevitable
7921908 you shall not place a stumbling block before the blind
7921909 the issue of gun control comes down then to a question about the nature of our society is it religious enough to merit free access to fire arms can americans be trusted
7921910 will entice you secretly saying let us go and worship the gods of other
7921911 t he bible always urges us to worry primarily not about external threats to our national welfare but internal ones moral threats
7921912 every source of tumah contamination bears a resemblance to death in that it conveys an illusory message that people are entrapped in nature their consciousness determined by material forces rather than their being free to make moral choices any of these conditions could leave the damaging materialistic and false impression that we are slaves to nature
7921913 in the biblical view by contrast we are free to choose to follow gods commandments wed have to be otherwise his commanding us to do right makes little sense
7921914 in truth the place of women in an authentically scriptual government would be all about protecting freedom in the long term a far cry from taliban style government
7921915 the bible wants us to appreciate that women have more power in the traditional role than they will have in the long run if the traditional family is undercut by a legal system uninformed by scriptual wisdom
7921916 that appears to be true but from this we are supposed to draw the inference that because he has no choice in his desires he has no choice about his actions either because he has the desires the actions must be accepted as well not only accepted but embraced and endorsed by the culture by the government this is tumah thinking pure and simple
7921917 more than perhaps any other issue abortion ought to serve as a litmus test in american public life
7921918 an act doesnt have to be murder to be wrong
7921919 a candidate who fails the test really doesnt get it and could be supported only with the greatest reluctance
7921920 in the absence of a revived parenting ethos voting for or against prayer in school would be fairly meaningless that is why the bible lays such emphasis on the role of fathers and mothers and none at all of the role of the school
7921921 religion is often unable to restrain man from the numberless temptations which chance offers nor can it check that passion for gain which everything contributes to arouse but its influence over the mind of woman is supreme and women are the protectors of morals there is certainly no country in the world where the tie of marriage is more respected than in america
7921922 reading is going to affect what they do if they cant read or comprehend they cant go on to do things in life like being doctors
7921923 these kids brought in pennies nickels and dimes and put it into a pot and came up with a 360 check which they gave to us
7921924 hopefully these kids will go on to college and come back to franklin county to be community leaders
7921925 dead space fans are invited to explore no known survivors
7921926 um hi this is one of the girls who was just in an uber hurry so we um still have the uh car keys
7921927 i have signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
7921928 for the hurt and damage they have suffered as a result
7921929 instead of just going for megabucks you just go to court to decide whats the truth and whats not
7921930 where minor celebrities and politicians receive more damages for abusive comments than are awarded to victims who have been raped or those that have lost of an eye or a leg
7921931 there is a straightforward difference between the statement of opinion and the perpetration of untruth
7921932 had he written a novel there would have been no case he would have had the defense of his imagination
7921933 the accidental american gives us context story and analysis we need for a just immigration policy it is a must read

7921935 we held a meeting this past week on how to plan the centenary year celebrations a number of schools journalists and directors of gandhi bhavan across the country took part at the meeting chaired by vice chancellor prof deepak pental the principal and teachers in charge of the gandhi study circle at different colleges also attended the brainstorming session
7921936 we have one cabin left tonight honeysuckle its perfect for one guest
7921937 perfect ill take it how long will it take me to get there from flagstaff
7921938 turn around there was a landslide the road was completely blocked but theyve cleared a lane it could be another few hours before theyre finished
7921939 you poor thing have you eaten do you have any food do you want soup chili tea
7921940 did you bring a laptop we have a pretty good collection of movies you can choose from if you want to watch something and we have popcorn too
7921941 make sure you hike the narrows in zion but dont rent the water boots they try to sell you on i got a nasty case of plantar fascitis that lasted for a year after wearing them
7921942 hey kids this is the vortex wooooo lets climb up and see if my head starts spinning around on my neck i want to be healed halleluiah oh ancient spirits here i come
7921943 im touching this rock feel the heeealing oh native ones give me your power im in the vortex
7921944 even if you dont respect this place you shouldnt spoil it for your children or for other people trying to appreciate it next time zip it
7921945 i dont know what the four corners are mam can you just give me a city and ill look it up in the computer
7921946 im sorry there arent any supervisors available to speak with you but i can have one call you back within eight hours
7921947 interesting you have a very long marriage line youve never been married
7921948 the flag should never be displayed with the union down except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property
7921949 make a political statement or to suggest that we are in extreme danger to life or property
7921950 ive always believed that nobody greater impacts nfl games than the quarterback
7921951 he gets a lot of attention and blame as he should but not enough of that considers that if the other 10 people around him dont do what they are supposed to do it is the quarterback who is most adversely affected
7921952 now where quarterback issues really come into play is when you have practiced all week for a certain way the game will be played and practiced what to expect from a defense and you get in the game and they are giving you totally different looks now what very few quarterbacks in the league only a handful can adjust adapt and execute an on the fly game plan so how does a coach protect himself and his team he has the quarterback simply manage the offense
7921953 a lot of great things happened for us late on offense in that game but youd have to say that we dont have a chance in the fourth quarter if we hadnt taken a team that had a prolific scoring offense and kept them from lighting up the board
7921954 you can talk about stats and all the other stuff but in the end it was all about keeping new england to 14 points that gave us a chance
7921955 new england couldnt get the ball off receivers were open on some plays it didnt matter every defense has players who are gifted some have players who are smart this one has a lot who have both traits
7921956 nobody ive played for has had a defense like this that is ever evolving that takes you on a journey
7921957 one door of it opens to another door of possibilities it has variety in blitzes and variety in everything it does its a press its a zone blitz its a man attack with all principles in one its like a germ that spreads it can be what we want it to be we can take it again to a great place
7921958 it is a defense that relies on technique much like the entire game of football relies on it
7921959 if your technique is right you can play defense in this league for a long time
7921960 we are crisper now than we were at this time last year
7921961 were in the second year with our defensive coaches and with this system but this years giants defense is really up in the air everybody is speculating right now for many of our young guys this is their time i dont know how good we are going to be or what we are going to do but i know we wont be sitting back in trying to find out well be on the attack
7921962 if we win two out of three then we should have a good chance of staying up
7921963 but you always want to get out and win games and get in the winning habit
7921964 we have taught him certain things but other things like music he picks up he just likes to imitate what he hears
7921965 our nephews taught him to say exterminate like a dalek and he also whistles dock of the bay the theme tune from mission impossible renditions of red red wine ymca and perfect impressions of water splashing and a squeak in the floorboards
7921966 it happened before and he was found on someones rooftop a mile or so away from our home
7921967 we just hope the same thing happens this time we really do miss him and want him back as soon as possible
7921968 luther and calvin if they should make their appearance now would act very differently in the altered state of things from what they did three hundred year ago their main zeal would be directed no doubt against such purely negative pseudo protestantism protestant rationalism as something altogether worse than popery itself
7921969 let us first with united strength expel the devil from our own temple into which he has stolen under the passport of our excessive toleration before we proceed to exorcise and cleanse the dome of st peter
7921970 if such were the fact the reformation must stand in direct contradiction to the holy scriptures and be adjudged by its own umpire to condemnation as a sinful work of man teh sect system like rationalism is a prostitution and caricature of true protestantism and nothing else away with human denominations down with religious sects let our watchword be one spirit and one body one shepherd and one flock rationalism and sectarianism are the most dangerous enemies of the church at the present time they are both but different sides of one and the same principle a onesided false subjectivity sundered from the authority of the objective rationalism is theoretic sectarianism sectarianism is practical rationalism
7921971 one drop of black blood and youre black the truth is every african american is biracial go back far enough and youll find the massah was in the slave quarters
7921972 single parent households high school dropouts the statistics are there for everybody to see we have to confront that head on
7921973 everything you always wanted to know about sex but were afraid to ask

7921977 i ask basic questions what are you going to do in the shoe
7921978 we can check the wear patterns to see if that shoe is correct for you
7921979 some people want one shoe for everything and thats just not possible today
7921980 dont wear a running shoe for volleyball running is a straight forward activity volleyball is back and forth running shoes dont have any lateral support so youll roll an ankle
7921981 that helps transition as you pull your toe up and makes the transition smoother since you dont leave the ground
7921982 a true crosstrainer used to be something cut a little higher
7921983 the big thing these days is how the midsole is set up if you have an unstable midsole youre going to roll your ankle
7921984 we developed footwear in concert with sparq to support that kind of training activity and launched in march and april
7921985 that is the shoe that can stand up to different activities
7921986 egypt has shown a genuine will to bridge the internal palestinian gap
7921987 greater efforts are however needed to reconcile the splits especially between fatah and hamas

7922001 seven years ago these little sookiess got their nose in the extended trading hours trough by starting with one application on the gold coast then extended it to the sunshine coast then to brisbane and away they went

7922005 were just not going to rush anything were gonna walk through the process however slowly it needs to happen in order for the healing and restoration to be complete and then well go from there
7922006 im actually seeking professional counselling myself i need to be able to unravel a lot of emotion thats bombarding me at the moment i owe it to myself to work through that properly and to him
7922007 i had questions after the shock of it all but my initial thoughts after hearing that were a sense of sorrow for the church and that a lot of people were going to be hurt because of it
7922008 i was the first one he told he confessed everything to me
7922009 he just went through it where it had started everything in his life as a young kid the patterns he was crying sobbing actually absolutely sobbing he just said i dont have cancer
7922010 he was terrified i still remember the look on his face it was a very hard moment for him as it was for me hearing it
7922011 i could just see a really broken unwell man at that point i found it really quite hard to get angry
7922012 seeing your husband of seven years absolutely sobbing in front of you risking everything coming forward and telling the truth in that instance it was really hard to be angry or mad
7922013 i never questioned it when you love someone you trust them i had no reason not to trust him
7922014 perhaps i feel a little bit foolish in this hindsights a fabulous thing but im trying not to beat myself up
7922015 in the middle of the night he was in so much pain i would put towels in the microwave to try and give him some relief in his back
7922016 before i stopped working to care for him i was busy hed have doctors appointments when i couldnt be there and he would say its fine you dont need to be there
7922017 or i would just drop him off at the hospital
7922018 were only talking two weeks since admitting his lies theres a lot of stuff to deal with
7922019 that sort of side of things hasnt really hit me yet theres many levels and layers to everything i can almost talk about it like im removed from it thats where the professional help will help me work through that it hasnt hit me yet
7922020 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns

7922026 the most important thing is we would like the possibility to defend ourselves in the european court of justice
7922027 so aland got no chance to defend itself if there are penalties for finland to pay then according to the act of autonomy aland could be obliged to pay part of them
7922028 it would create a very awkward situation for the aland islands if they rejected the lisbon treaty we dont have experience of such a matter
7922029 today there is a strong feeling among our politicians that there is not a qualified majority in favour of lisbon
7922030 all of our political parties say wed like to say yes but were interested in first getting decent conditions

7922097 there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft
7922098 it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7922099 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state

7922101 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers
7922102 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7922103 the first thing we do in these situation is divert to safety take the safety first option

7922112 manheim is pleased to have partnered with naaa on numerous initiatives that have benefited the entire auction industry

7922115 we at naaa are proud of our affiliation with all of the naaa member auctions and thank manheim auctions for allowing us to call them members
7922116 the cause and effect in this situation is obvious and the cause is a clear set of external factors collapsing revenue and material costs increasing at double digit rates

7922123 as the worlds population grows so will demand for food and energy using non food feedstocks for feed and energy is one way that agriculture can apply innovation to create renewable sustainable solutions
7922124 there are a number of challenges associated with harvest collection and storage of cellulosic biomass this collaborative effort brings together three agricultural leaders to identify and address the complexities that come with commercializing a new feedstock
7922125 expansions in biorenewable energy are possible if we are able to combine productivity and sustainability improvements in agriculture and forestry with a variety of biomass feedstocks and the most applicable conversion technologies
7922126 we are hopeful the collaboration of our companies will lead to innovative technologies to improve collection and provisioning of biomass feedstocks such as corn stover
7922127 advanced biotechnologies are protecting plants better than ever helping the plants to achieve their full grain yield potential
7922128 achieving this potential also means having healthier larger plants producing even more biomass this provides an opportunity to convert an underutilized resource into a new source of value for growers and processors its an exciting area of research to focus on and were pleased to be a part of it

7922131 i view the zipcar concept as an important component in rices efforts to become a climate neutral campus the program will reduce our transportation related greenhouse gas emissions while providing cheap high quality mobility on demand

7922176 one of the girls saw her dad in the garden and went to play there while rashid was there as well
7922177 in the meantime there was a telephone call which he went to answer leaving the child behind
7922178 she picked up the barrel which was quite heavy for her and just did exactly the same thing her father does
7922179 somehow she put her finger on the trigger and next thing he knew the kid fell down it all happened in seconds
7922180 it just highlights how vulnerable people are in the presence of weapons and guns
7922181 people have died as a result of airgun pellets so they are dangerous weapons if not used in a safe environment

7922201 effects of external qigong therapy on osteoarthritis of the knee
7922202 although further research needs to be conducted qigong may be an effective complementary treatment for osteoarthritis
7922203 given the limitation and potential adverse effects of drug intervention of osteoarthritis qigong therapy might prove to be a valuable option as a supplement to conventional treatment
7922204 the 2008 report finds that campus leaders value sustainability they speak about it plan for it hire staff to support it and the campuses they lead are steadily becoming greener models for the wider society
7922205 at the same time the educational curricula to prepare students for a post college world influenced by climate change are not keeping pace on most campuses the business leaders and facilities managers appear to be making greater strides towards sustainability than their faculty peers
7922206 this report card tells us there is a widening gap between where higher education actually is on teaching sustainability versus where it should be
7922207 given the environmental challenges and opportunities this generation will face i find this cause for deep concern and am committed to working with our partners to address this on both state and federal levels
7922208 the nwf report card is the gold standard for charting the sustainability movement in higher education coverage of both operational and academic programs is particularly important strongly recommended reading for administrators faculty and students
7922209 the campus environment 2008 report card reveals just how well institutions of higher learning are preparing students for the environmental challenges they will face in the 21st century
7922210 many of the men and women who will lead our businesses educational institutions and government agencies in the next 20 years are in college now
7922211 we need to offer todays college students the kind of academic and professional preparation that will ready them to envision and create a healthier and more sustainable world
7922212 it is still on the table as a possibility but we are looking a lot of different things
7922213 the government has got to be seen to be helping ordinary people in these difficult economic times the price of oil is going up and therefore fuel prices are going up
7922214 my own view on the prospect of a windfall tax on energy companies is that the government will be cautious about introducing something which has an implicit retrospective element to it
7922215 im sure there will be a change of policy this autumn what the detail is of that change will determine the level of my enthusiasm for remaining
7922216 a legalised raid on the companys bank accounts that would be very unhelpful because it would scare off investors and also could make the cost of investment much higher and in the end that would end up on the customers bills
7922217 every 1m you take out of each company through this legalised raid is 1m they have to raise elsewhere
7922218 6 be careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god 7 and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus
7922219 the word did not even enter the english vocabulary until the enlightenment of the 18th century the beginning of the modern era
7922220 by his very success in inventing labor saving devices modern man has manufactured an abyss of boredom that only the privileged classes in earlier civilizations have ever fathomed
7922221 boredom what happens when we lose contact with the universe
7922222 when people are bored it is primarily with their own selves
7922223 boredom has made more gamblers than greed more drunkards than thirst and perhaps as many suicides as despair
7922224 boredom is often the motivation for adultery and divorce abuse of alcohol or drugs and even suicide
7922225 boredom is a vital problem for the moralist since at least half the sins of mankind are caused by the fear of it
7922226 19 lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal 20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal 21 for where your treasure is there will your heart be also
7922227 25 choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season
7922228 11 these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full
7922229 35 i have shewed you all things how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive
7922230 26 for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul
7922231 3 for i rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth 4 i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth
7922232 19 for what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing are not even ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming 20 for ye are our glory and joy
7922233 7 the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the lord is sure making wise the simple 8 the statutes of the lord are right rejoicing the heart the commandment of the lord is pure enlightening the eyes 9 the fear of the lord is clean enduring for ever the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether 10 more to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb 11 moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is great reward
7922234 4 for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith 5 who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god
7922235 23 drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomachs sake and thine often infirmities
7922236 25 therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment 26 behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they 27 which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature 28 and why take ye thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin 29 and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these 30 wherefore if god so clothe the grass of the field which to day is and to morrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith 31 therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed 32 for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things
7922237 33 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
7922238 3 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven 4 blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted 5 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth 6 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled
7922239 11 and he said a certain man had two sons 12 and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and he divided unto them his living 13 and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living 14 and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want 15 and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine 16 and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him 17 and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough and to spare and i perish with hunger 18 i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee 19 and am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants 20 and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him 21 and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son 22 but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet 23 and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry 24 for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be merry 25 now his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew nigh to the house he heard musick and dancing 26 and he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant 27 and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound 28 and he was angry and would not go in therefore came his father out and intreated him 29 and he answering said to his father lo these many years do i serve thee neither transgressed i at any time thy commandment and yet thou never gavest me a kid that i might make merry with my friends 30 but as soon as this thy son was come which hath devoured thy living with harlots thou hast killed for him the fatted calf 31 and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that i have is thine 32 it was meet that we should make merry and be glad for this thy brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found
7922240 18 and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation 19 to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation 20 now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christs stead be ye reconciled to god 21 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him
7922241 21 then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him till seven times 22 jesus saith unto him i say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven
7922242 14 for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us 15 having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace 16 and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby 17 and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh
7922243 14 now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feebleminded support the weak be patient toward all men
7922244 33 these things i have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
7922245 we may be able to comfort those who are in trouble
7922246 14 now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feebleminded support the weak be patient toward all men
7922247 a mere expectancy created by the law and liable to be revoked or destroyed by the same authority
7922248 law of april 1 1878 was repealed before the death of the intestate the officers expectancy became impossible of realization the money which was to pay the amount claimed had been previously transferred and mingled with another fund and was no longer subject to the provisions of that act
7922249 there is no claim here that congress has taken property in violation of the fifth amendment since railroad benefits like social security benefits are not contractual and may be altered or even eliminated at any time
7922250 85 years of unbroken constitutional law at the federal level beginning with pennie
7922251 w hile pennie has never been expressly overruled most state supreme courts subsequently rejected the gratuity approach in favor of an approach that viewed such programs as creating implied in fact unilateral contracts
7922252 better reasoned view recognizes that non vested employees have contractual rights in pension plans subject to reasonable modification in order to keep the system flexible to meet changing conditions and to maintain the actuarial soundness of the system
7922253 it is well settled in california that public employment is not held by contract but by statute
7922254 u nlike other terms of public employment which are wholly a matter of statute pension rights are obligations protected by the contract clause of the federal and state constitutions
7922255 b y entering public service an employee obtains a vested contractual right to earn a pension on terms substantially equivalent to those then offered by the employer
7922256 an employees contractual pension expectations are measured by benefits which are in effect not only when employment commences but which are thereafter conferred during the employees subsequent tenure
7922257 we conclude that incumbent legislators had a vested right to earn additional pension benefits through continued service
7922258 the employee has a vested right not merely to preservation of benefits already earned pro rata but also by continuing to work until retirement eligibility to earn the benefits or their substantial equivalent promised during his prior service
7922259 i t is necessary to perceive the terms of the contract and to utilize those terms to measure the claimed impairment
7922260 it is obvious that the increase in the percentage of the employees contribution to the retirement fund is a detriment
7922261 if the modification of walshs retirement benefits was consistent with the reservation of power to the legislature then it was valid regardless of whether the retirement system can be said to have granted contractual rights to members of the legislature
7922262 bear some material relation to the theory of a pension system and its successful operation
7922263 the right to pension benefits vests upon acceptance of employment
7922264 membership in any pension or retirement system of the state shall be an enforceable contractual relationship the benefits of which shall not be diminished or impaired
7922265 the citys argument that the officers should be deemed to have consented to the modification of their vested retirement system rights because the concessions were agreed to by their unions ignores that a union may not bargain away the vested rights of its members without the express consent of those members
7922266 i n a variety of factual settings courts have held that a union has no authority on behalf of its membership to bargain away various forms of deferred compensation earned during the terms of prior collective bargaining agreements absent knowing consent by those who would be adversely affected
7922267 collective bargaining agreement may not waive statutory rights which arise from an extraordinarily strong and explicit state policy
7922268 u nder established contract principles vested retirement rights may not be altered without the pensioners consent
7922269 t he board may authorize payment of premiums for retired members who have served twelve 12 years or more
7922270 a law is not intended to create private contractual or vested rights but merely declares a policy to be pursued until the legislature shall ordain otherwise
7922271 must be plain and susceptible of no other reasonable construction
7922272 a bsent an adequate expression of an actual intent of the state to bind itself
7922273 a time when ones spirit is subdued and sad one knows not why when the past seems a storm swept desolation life a vanity and a burden and the future but a way to death
7922274 a high level of hopelessness exacerbates the atherosclerotic process in middle aged men
7922275 when you say a situation or a person is hopeless you are slamming the door in the face of god
7922276 it is impossible for that man to despair who remembers that his helper is omnipotent
7922277 he that is fallen cannot help him that is down
7922278 there are no hopeless situations there are only people who have grown hopeless about them
7922279 surrendering to despair is mans favorite pastime god offers a better plan but it takes effort to grab it and faith to claim it
7922280 11 if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him
7922281 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life 17 for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved
7922282 35 and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst
7922283 3 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead
7922284 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ 2 by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god
7922285 4 for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope
7922286 5 for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith
7922287 blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great god and savior jesus christ
7922288 life with christ is an endless hope without him a hopeless end
7922289 6 but christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end
7922290 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised
7922291 19 which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into that within the veil
7922292 every contract by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession trade or business of any kind is to that extent void
7922293 have been clear in their expression that section 16600 represents a strong public policy of the state which should not be diluted by judicial fiat
7922294 the california supreme court also refused to invalidate the line of california cases starting with
7922295 claims that in any way arise from or out of are based upon or relate to edwards employment
7922296 selling at unfairly high prices or buying at unfairly low prices
7922297 refusing to trade with relative trading parties without any justification
7922298 likelihood of elimination or restriction of competition in the relevant market as a result of the proposed concentration

7922302 undertakings that cause loss to others as a result of their monopolistic conduct shall be liable for civil liabilities in accordance with law
7922303 industry associations shall not organize the business operators in their industry to engage in the monopolistic conducts prohibited by this chapter
7922304 trade associations shall strengthen self discipline of the industries provide guidance for enterprises in their industries to compete lawfully and protect the order of market competition
7922305 ok good i could say that with young people like you
7922306 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7922307 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
7922308 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different
7922309 colonising a continent isnt easy colonising a continent during the ice age is even harder so for early homo sapiens colonising ice age europe a new shared and flashy looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded he said
7922310 thus during hard times these larger social networks might act like a type of life insurance ensuring exchange and trade among members of the same team

7922317 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
7922318 it simply means that the russian president continues not to honor the commitments that the russians have signed on to
7922319 while there have been some significant russian movements they are not yet living up to the terms of the cease fire agreement

7922321 calling talk radio is a powerful weapon we humans are dealing with a lot of lies and propoganda daily so speaking truth to 500 000 at a time for 30 seconds to several minutes x the number of motivated people like us will bring down the deception i believe this
7922322 and i got exactly what i expected from mark levin on his neoconservative radio talk show which is included at the end of the video

7922333 the big thing is weve got to keep the right 53 guys not necessarily the best 53 players but the right 53
7922334 yeah theres some of that rich bisaccia hes obviously fighting to keep guys that can help him cover and return kicks bruce allen and the scouting department have their say obviously so everybodys got a say in this matter and at the end of the day
7922335 hell be back on the field monday i just talked to b j before practice hes doing extremely well and the great thing about this injury is hell be 100 percent i believe ready to go for the regular season its been awkward
7922336 i hope so our scouts are looking at everybody elses rosters just like were looking at our own there are going to be players that are released that we might think could help us and we wont hesitate to bring those guys in thats all part

7922338 no heck no i realize we havent schemed anything we havent put in any strategic returns its been a lot of man blocking returns trying to see who has a knack for getting their head on a swivel and athletically breaking down in space and sustaining a block some guys have done well some guys have not done well that will be an area once we isolate who the players are on the team we can put in a strategic return and get good at it and thats what we always do

7922340 despite a slight gain of 665 last year middle income households are no better off now that they were at the prior economic peak of 2000
7922341 in other words the economic recovery of the 2000s which ended last year has done very little to boost their living standards theyve done their part contributing to strong productivity growth but theyve far too little to show for it
7922342 mattel itself had approached the indian courts in february 2008 seeking an order for taking down scrabulous from facebook and other servers
7922343 the honble high court has reserved judgment in this matter after hearing both parties it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the honble high courts decision mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary
7922344 it is even more astonishing that facebook which claims to be a fair and neutral party took this step even though they were fully aware of the circumstances under which the mattel letter was sent to them

7922351 it doesnt seem like the crowd is on the edge of their seats
7922352 but i cant help but feel after the first night of the convention that it was largely a wasted night
7922353 they did a poor job explaining what the choices are
7922354 they are trying to race across the viability threshold before the republicans can say that this man is not ready to be president

7922357 it is important for us we have a run of four home games and home form has not been particularly good since i took over
7922358 i am going to use these four games to get the players in a frame of mind to be positive and play in front of a crowd at elland road
7922359 its the lowest i have felt as a manager i did not sleep a wink all weekend in fact i havent slept a wink for nine months
7922360 at wigan we were knocked out of the fa cup by non league canvey island and were bottom of division two the old third division
7922361 i am trying to draw on all my previous experiences as a manager but this is the toughest time i have faced because this is the biggest and best club i have been at
7922362 maybe because i want it so desperately maybe because i want to get it right and give the fans a team to be proud of i am putting more pressure on myself
7922363 i signed a three and a half year contract not a one year contract hopefully i will be here to see that through
7922364 i know people are doubting me but hopefully i can prove to them that i can do the job

7922369 recent valuations in financial stocks suggest either the world is coming to an end or there are some great values
7922370 so far the financial sector has written off more than 300 million in assets by some accounts the damage will rise to 1 trillion or more before all is said and done
7922371 the selloff which at its nadir was marked by a 55 year over year decline in the kbw index pushed the constituent members down to a collective 0 64 times book value and a dividend yield of 9
7922372 at those levels either the world is coming to an end or there are tremendous bargains for investors with the courage of their convictions looking hard at the data we can only conclude the latter is the case provided youre careful with your investment choices
7922373 u s bancorp had a downbeat quarter but all things being equal were content with its results the companys per share earnings dropped 18 in the quarter to 53 cents a share 7 cents below wall streets forecast
7922374 the minneapolis based bank took a 63 million impairment charge for securities and added to its provision for credit losses which combined shaved 11 cents off of its bottom line
7922375 on the plus side usb posted strong loan and deposit growth along with healthy core fee revenue growth and in contrast to many of its peers its net interest margin expanded during the quarter
7922376 taking advantage of the depressed share price insiders have jumped in with both feet scooping up more than 189 000 shares of usb in transactions valued at more than 4 million

7922381 someone serious about fiscal responsibility wouldnt have let our nations debt explode by more than 3 trillion on his watch in large part to pay for the war in iraq apparently funding for war is fine but for minnesota its corrupt its just more evidence of how mr kline isnt serving minnesota hes serving the president his party and special interests
7922382 in washington today congress decides how to spend many of your hard earned tax dollars through an
7922383 although kline may not get as much funding as others whatever he can get helps scott county officials said for example on a project to expand county rd 21 he helped obtain 750 000 in 2003 860 000 in 2004 and 2 1 million in 2005

7922385 about 40 percent of the money in the states transportation budget comes from the federal gas and diesel tax according to tony kellen president of the minnesota public transit association which is a statewide association of public transit providers funding agencies and advocates
7922386 we wish he were in there fighting for those projects commissioner jon ulrich said
7922387 i n interviews commissioners stressed that that isnt the purpose for which they are seeking funds
7922388 kline put politics over principle and voted against earmark reform legislation last january because it was more important to him to obstruct the new democratic majority in congress

7922398 the company knowingly stole from its customers mostly poor people and the recently deceased when it designed and implemented the sweeps
7922399 when a whistleblower uncovered the scam and brought it to his superiors they buried the information and continued the illegal practice
7922400 stealing from our customers is a business decision not a legal decision
7922401 people were coming up to me and going i love your album and youre doing so many acoustic shows so i decided to capture that
7922402 things are not as clean and orderly as they seem
7922403 businesses want to make money discrimination opens them up to lawsuits lawsuits are expensive when you lose theyd lose more money in a lawsuit than they gain by discriminating therefore they dont discriminate
7922404 oh this is a man therefore we will pay him more this is a woman we will pay her less
7922405 oh this guy has x y and z qualities so he deserves more

7922422 this association is consistent with a large number of studies identifying carcinogens in incense smoke
7922423 and given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke from burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications
7922424 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of particulate matter and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution

7922450 what would be needed were americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part through protests and struggle on the streets and in the courts through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time

7922460 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
7922461 do you think they were really plotting to kill obama
7922462 i dont want to say yes i dont want to say no
7922463 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out

7922489 the us dollar weakened significantly against other major currencies in 2007 and according to some economists is expected to depreciate further in 2008
7922490 as a consequence other currencies particularly the euro are poised to weaken the us dollars dominance as the currency of choice for international remittances and payments
7922491 this trend could also drive an increase in observed instances of bulk cash transfers denominated in currencies other than canadian and us dollars

7922526 its very cynical even more so when you understand that in many african american demographics gun homicides are the number one cause of death
7922527 to have these people use the history of discrimination against african americans going back 140 years to say this is why we need to have guns in churches restaurants and schools where is this going to end
7922528 there is a connection there is no doubt about it
7922529 horrible stories to justify why the legislature and the courts should allow for easier access to guns
7922530 its very disingenuous and it is not appropriate to link these horrible massacres to what they are doing in 2008
7922531 we need less guns on the street rather than more guns if you took the guns off the street particularly in african american hispanic and poor white communities the homicides would drop dramatically
7922532 the gun violence that is occurring there is not happening with the people who are going through background checks its happening with people who already have a criminal history
7922533 if they have a criminal history particularly a violent criminal history then we dont want them carrying a weapon
7922534 law enforcement back then thought you ought to disarm african americans
7922535 now we are seeing people arguing about the same thing if they are law abiding citizens regardless of what color they are they ought to be able to protect themselves
7922536 we need less guns on the street rather than more guns if you took the guns off the street particularly in african american hispanic and poor white communities the homicides would drop dramatically

7922541 im going to protect myself any way i can and the castle law is part of that

7922543 as crazy as it sounds those kinds of things can and in some states do happen
7922544 while searching for bat carcasses under wind turbines we noticed that many of the carcasses had no external injuries or no visible cause of death

7922546 when used in conjunction with for example hydro electric generation it is most certainly a reliable and very viable energy source
7922547 i dont know how on earth you have come up with that efficiency value but you should know that 28 is actually very high the theoretical limit for a wind turbine is 60 if i remember correctly and an actual efficiency of half the maximum limit is admirable
7922548 id live next to a wind turbine any day over an efficient coal or gas station
7922549 we dont have to worry about what pollution is doing to the water supply because natural forces do way way more damage

7922557 if behavioral psychology was handmaid to the horrors perpetrated at guant namo bay abu ghraib and cia transnational black sites what new nightmares are in store for humanity when advances in neuroscience complex computer algorithms and a secretive national security state enter stage far right
7922558 would be how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight other questions raised by controlling the mind how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands as cognitive neuroscience and related technologies become more pervasive using technology for nefarious purposes becomes easier
7922559 the potential impact of neuroscience research is greater than previously thought
7922560 battlefield commanders of all nations hold sacrosanct the right to determine the applications
7922561 if governments or scientists were to try to develop a system to pre screen neuroscientific cognitive manipulators which would be hipaa approved and tested and robust in its core science success would be as likely as it was with mines and cluster bombs meaning not likely
7922562 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that someday there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects

7922585 but you know you dont want to get negative choppy every single day and i think what were seeing today here is a democratic party thats positive thats unified that wants to heal that wants to bring bipartisanship and you know ill talk about that too
7922586 if the republicans are good at anything they are experts at fear and smear divide and conquer
7922587 what we have to do though i think is rebut those charges but also to point out the real mccain record

7922784 three helicopters are already air dropping food materials but it will not make much difference more and more air force helicopters should be pressed into crisis management and more boats to rescue those who are trapped and taken to safe area if we rely on the state government assistance we will be responsible for the death of thousands more to be killed in this flood

7922796 its not really hillarys job to bring the party together its obamas job
7922797 they are both going to do what they have to do that does not mean they will enjoy it
7922798 there is a lot obama could have done to unify the party and basically he hasnt lifted a finger
7922799 feels like the obama campaign ran against and systematically dismissed his administrations accomplishments
7922800 and he feels like he was painted as a racist during the primary process sen obama would go a long way towards healing these wounds if he were to specifically praise the accomplishments of the clinton presidency in a line or two during his speech on thursday
7922801 her challenge is to make the most of the emotion without popping the roof off

7922803 our goal with the new jets stadium is to create the best home field in football and provide a range of seating options
7922804 we listened to our fans in designing this plan that is why we decided to have no psls in the entire upper bowl including those on the 50 yard line
7922805 is the closest thing to having a spot on the roster
7922806 our most loyal fans will always be at the front of the line

7922824 the rise in violence which we are seeing is linked to the increasing number of operations by atlantic alliance and afghan forces in zones which were previously considered sanctuaries where we didnt go
7922825 it is because we are more and more active that there are more and more operations by the taliban
7922826 we were fighting terrorism and our goal was to bring stability
7922827 we gave numbers of martyrs to get this goal now we are afraid that kurds could be targets for revenge attacks by the terrorists
7922828 during the period we served there we did not discriminate between people as arabs kurds and turkmen
7922829 during our deployment there in spite of the serious threats we were happy because we felt we had secured the lives of people in these areas

7922833 confirmed information about the arrival of big quantities of weapons into the camp
7922834 the police force was compelled to respond to the attacking elements but not more than seven citizens at the displaced camp were injured
7922835 we dont have the required force to increase but we are doing our utmost
7922836 such actions severely threaten the safety and security of civilians who have a right to protection under international humanitarian law
7922837 this incident puts increased strain on a population already struggling to cope with flooding that has recently destroyed up to 6 000 shelters
7922838 the large and growing unmet need for paediatric hiv aids services demonstrates the failure of our pmtct programmes to avert parent to child transmission of hiv
7922839 if we prevent hiv infection in children then we do not have to take care of them when they are infected
7922840 for some women it is the distance to the health centre or the poor quality of services and personnel as well as lack of infrastructure
7922841 but there is also low male involvement in pmtct as the men deny their spouses the opportunity to participate in the programme
7922842 many women did not know that giving food or a drink to the breastfeeding baby of an hiv positive mother was not allowed
7922843 cultural beliefs social stigma ignorance and economic status influenced the mothers attitudes and preference for the different feeding alternatives
7922844 if the mothers do not get infected then the children will not
7922845 i am convinced that in this country we can reduce new infections political will must be re energised
7922846 we have a moral obligation to ensure that our children and grandchildren are born and remain free from hiv aids

7922849 pollack seems oddly unaware of historys motivating forces to assert that what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair is plain silly the boston tea party could not have been prevented by prozac what is troubling about pollacks view which is fairly representative of his fellow liberal interventionists who are likely to be in power soon is its lack of clarity no matter what good will americas policy community proclaims toward the middle east this mix of blinkered indulgence of israel and disdain for the rest of the region as well as a predilection for wilsonian dreams over achievable goals suggests we will remain in the wilderness for some time to come
7922850 by restoring the colonel to what now seems his rightful position as a courageous principled radical who was dickinsons chosen reader admirer and advocate wineapple throws what she describes as a small considered beam upon the work and life of these two seemingly incompatible friends the recluse and the activist that beam when directed by a writer as thorough and intuitive as wineapple brightens not only the pale figures of the poet and the hitherto elusive colonel but the poems for which upon occasion dickinson drew inspiration from higginsons more active life

7922882 mr banting was a fat man at age sixty five the five foot five banting weighted in at over two hundred pounds
7922883 banting was recently retired had no family history of obesity nor did he consider himself either lazy inactive or given to excessive indulgence at the table
7922884 nonetheless corpulence had crept up on him in his thirties as with many of us today despite his best efforts he took up daily rowing and gained muscular vigor a prodigious appetite and yet more weight
7922885 he cut back on calories which failed to induce weight loss but did leave him exhausted and beset by boils he tried walking riding horseback and manual labor his weight increased he consulted the best doctors he tried purgatives and diuretics his weight increased
7922886 luckily for banting he consulted a surgeon who had recently been to paris the doctor had just heard the great physiologist claude bernard lecture on diabetes
7922887 a diet of only meat and dairy would check the secretion of sugar in the urine of a diabetic
7922888 excessive obesity might be allied to diabetes as to its cause and if a purely animal diet were useful in the latter disease a combination of animal food with a vegetable diet that contained neither sugar nor starch might arrest the undue formation of fat
7922889 he ate three meals a day of meat fish or game usually five or six ounces at a meal with one or two stale toast or cooked fruit on the side he had his evening tea with a few more ounces of fruit or stale toast he scrupulously avoided any other food that might contain either sugar or starch in particular bread milk beer sweets and potatoes
7922890 despite a considerable allowance of alcohol in bantings regimen four or five glasses of wine each day a cordial every morning and an evening tumbler of gin whisky or brandy banting dropped thirty five pounds by the following may eight months later and fifty pounds by early the next year
7922891 i have not felt better in health than now for the last twenty six years he wrote
7922892 had entered the english language as a verb meaning to diet
7922893 gouty obese and nervous we strongly recommend him to bant
7922894 did what members of established societies often do when confronted with a radical new concept they attacked both the message and the messenger the lancet like todays newsweek first whined that bantings diet was old news second that his diet could be dangerous
7922895 theres a growing shift toward healthy plant based diets especially among people looking to lose weight and keep it off
7922896 theyre made to eat forage and were making them eat grain
7922897 you know its interesting the california decision as well as the massachusetts decision i dont think should ever have been implemented by the governors schwarzenegger and romney
7922898 they were both decisions that the governors simply could have said the court has said that we have to do it but let them enforce it because those were administrative decisions that had to put that in place and there was no mandate
7922899 my message was you took an oath and you dont have to agree or disagree with the law you took an oath to uphold the law
7922900 well leave it to the courts to litigate what the law is but once the courts have ruled if youve taken an oath under the constitution you have to follow your oath
7922901 i personally didnt feel that same sex marriages were marriages if they were civil unions i dont think that would have bothered me but i personally didnt feel they were marriages i just didnt want to be officiating at one of those ceremonies
7922902 within hours of the november 18 2003 supreme judicial court decision legalizing gay marriage governor romney publicly denounced the courts ruling and affirmed traditional marriage
7922903 and that was just the beginning of his support for preserving traditional marriage
7922904 governor romney could not have been more public or vocal in his opposition to same sex marriage during his entire tenure as governor
7922905 he did not create same sex marriage that responsibility falls squarely on the shoulders of the massachusetts supreme judicial court for which chief justice margaret marshall has been pleased to accept full credit and responsibility
7922906 the courts landmark ruling established same sex marriage by judicially redefining the meaning of the word marriage
7922907 this final judicial order in the form of a declaratory judgment on may 17 2004 was what created same sex marriage in massachusetts
7922908 any administrative policies and procedures relative to solemnizing same sex marriages were carried out only as a direct result of the judiciarys final action in goodridge on may 17 2004
7922909 governor romney is pro individual and pro traditional marriage period
7922910 well you know ive not probably been an advocate for him in that position and you know i am going to let him defend himself and i dont want to relive the primary but i think that that was a very unfortunate position that he took in saying that well i cant do anything about it oh yes you can
7922911 he could have stopped it and should have stopped it
7922912 i respect the courts decision and as governor i will uphold its ruling
7922913 also as i have said in the past i will not support an amendment to the constitution that would overturn this state supreme court ruling

7923022 the obama campaign knows it cant argue the facts of the link between obama and ayers so it is instead resorting to a desperate campaign of intimidation and legal threats
7923023 the scary question this raises is if barack obama demonstrates this little regard for free speech from his opponents during the campaign what could the american people expect from him as a president
7923024 the tremendous amount of time money and effort the campaign is expending to run its own ads on the ayers controversy and dispatch its hired guns all over the country during the democratic convention speaks to the fear they must have that this issue is resonating with american voters

7923032 freddie macs indicated further cut of its common stock dividend will reduce our earnings
7923033 scaling back our quarterly dividend from 50 cents to 25 cents realigns it with our operating earnings this is consistent with our past practice of paying our operating earnings in quarterly dividends the new dividend provides a yield of about 7 5 based on the current stock price while we have made some additions to our loan loss reserves our core business is solid

7923045 he was ranting and raving flailing his arms up and down and then he pointed the weapon in our direction
7923046 we drew our weapons and shouted at him to put down the weapon and he finally put it down on a table on his porch chief marren was on the scene by then and made his way around in back of the porch and started talking to the man
7923047 the effective use of tactical procedures verbal communication and restraint all culminated in a peaceful resolution to a potentially lethal conflict
7923048 it may sound trite but it is part of the job however it made the job real to me realizing that anybody could have a gun at anytime and if it had gone off we would have a whole different scenario so im really happy nobody got hurt
7923049 the film is an entirely false and distorted account of what took place
7923050 i cannot understand why they had to change things to that extent
7923051 if you didnt know you could hit what was needed you shouldnt have taken the assignment
7923052 the office manager asked me directly if i sent you out to appraise a million dollar home and the comps comparable sales only came in at 800 000
7923053 the market is full of million dollar houses selling for 750 000 why should i be responsible for adding one more foreclosed property to the already growing list
7923054 was that a form of interference you bet it was
7923055 it was just a little subtler a little less direct than it used to be
7923056 is really to find out will this guy play ball will he be cooperative when we need him
7923057 things are tough sales volumes are down and some lenders know that theyll eventually find someone wholl cooperate
7923058 its not easy for some of them to say no especially when they see business go to folks who everybody knows are playing the game
7923059 millett enjoys a strong brand equity and customer loyalty for their rings amp bases and their recently expanded line of optics particularly on the tactical and law enforcement side of the business which will complement and strengthen our existing product lines

7923075 you go out there and you want to prove people wrong and get better
7923076 there were some good things some could have been better
7923077 protection at times is a little bit of an issue i thought he made some good throws there were probably some plays that he probably would have liked to have back but that is pretty much true for everyone
7923078 i thought matt gutierrez did a good job at leading the team and the opportunities he had
7923079 he hung in there he took a few hits but he stepped up and threw the ball he made a nice throw coming out of the end zone it looked like a guy was in his face when he threw that one to tyson devree
7923080 we want to try to take advantage of those opportunities make the most of them and gain as much ground as we can as a football team to get ready for kansas city and also try to evaluate the roster in terms of making the cuts
7923081 we have to be at 75 on tuesday as you know and then 53 by the end of the week weve got quite a few decisions to make there and that will be part of it as well as trying to get our team ready to go against kansas city in the opener and the 15 games after that

7923095 i am very excited to have someone of jeffs experience and background on our team he brings a great deal of expertise in credit management as well as knowledge of the local market
7923096 sandy spring bank is in an excellent position to serve small and mid sized businesses in our market and our strategy is to expand this area further bill is a proven leader in our company and he will be in charge of executing this strategy within our commercial banking group
7923097 sandy spring bank has a strong reputation for outstanding loan quality and during these turbulent times in our industry having seasoned professionals like jeff and bill in these key positions is critical
7923098 dan is building a strong management team as we continue smoothly through our leadership transition
7923099 we believe that the remedy proposal confirms the validity of our intellectual property ip complaint that sirf infringed our patents
7923100 we are excited about this opportunity to construct an on grid solar power plant in beijing which would be the first solar power plant we construct and operate
7923101 we believe our participation in this project is in line with our strategy of expanding into downstream applications of pv
7923102 but growing problems of power leakage in mpus has driven a shift to putting more cores on a die forcing a historic transition to a parallel programming model yet to be invented
7923103 this is really about a new set of natural and immersive experiences we want to deliver
7923104 the parallel computing shift is like an accident along the way
7923105 there are a deep set of changes before you can even get to rebuilding libraries and rewriting applications
7923106 this is an ambitious shift and this is simply the first cut
7923107 initially they have done some of the obvious things supporting parallel tasks but i havent seen anything about efforts to abstract data
7923108 the futures parallel programming model will need new categories for sorting data so that it can be marshalled into appropriate locations in cache at the right time
7923109 programmers will need a whole new toolset to help debug optimize and validate parallel codes
7923110 debugging has to move from single step to visualization tools that capture trends in thousands of synchronized tasks
7923111 rapidmind and ct are pointing in the same direction but we have been around longer as a mature commercial offering while ct is still essentially a research api

7923113 gps is a major driver for todays mobile consumer electronics industry and is becoming an increasingly common demand from consumers for mobile devices which support a wide range of applications
7923114 our relationship with trimble fulfills this demand providing us access to their leading gps dsp software solutions that complement our rich technology portfolio
7923115 before closing the deal st expects to purchase the 20 percent of st nxp wireless that it doesnt already own
7923116 standard amp poors appreciates the business logic of the transaction which could be supportive for the business risk profiles of both st and ericsson in the medium term
7923117 however these positive aspects are mitigated by the material execution risks associated with the new joint venture and limited visibility on operating performance
7923118 there are challenges in executing the integration but the complementary nature of the products and customers is giving us the confidence we will be able to successfully do this
7923119 with our focus on miniaturization feature integration and that all critical power efficiency via has been enabling the increasing versatility and mobility of robotics for some time
7923120 vias processor platforms are quite literally at the heart of this new robotic age
7923121 robotics is clearly the next big industry and changes in the demographic structure make it an even more appealing industry for companies to invest in
7923122 growing elderly populations declining birth rates and shortages of manpower have all contributed to demand for entertainment robots or intelligent robots
7923123 like most light emission sources nanotubes emit light in all directions their spectrum was relatively broad and their efficiency was not very high
7923124 we attacked all these problems making its light directional so it can be coupled to optical filters or to a device to transport it we controlled its spectrum with an optical cavity and we have proposed a theory to help us achieve higher efficiency
7923125 we confined the emission in an optical cavity with two mirrors so that light forms a standing wave between the mirrors which enhanced the frequencies whose wavelength were equal to half the size of the cavity
7923126 we used lithography to form the cavities which achieved a dramatic enhancement confining the spectrum to about 10 percent of what it was without the cavity and giving us an overall enhancement in the efficiency of the emission of 400 percent
7923127 eliminates unwanted frequencies thus solving the problem of nanotubes having slightly different diameters
7923128 there has always been a controversy over whether electroluminescence and photoluminescence involve the same states so through comparisons using raman scattering we have now proven that they both use the same states
7923129 there are two types of emission from an object radiative and non radiative with the latter being the energies lost by heat
7923130 was always thought to be a fixed property of the material but what we realized was that it is not only the material that is quantized that has discrete states but the photons also are part of a field that has quantized states
7923131 emission comes by coupling these two fields we now feel that by using an electric field we can change the electronic structure of nanotubes so that heat cannot be generated

7923138 the baby is my main focus right now were getting the nursery ready
7923139 i cant wait to be a mom and he cant wait to be a dad so its fun i have the greatest husband hes so awesome its fun to have somebody that i love to do this with
7923140 they simply like high fat and high sweet foods better
7923141 we found that without question those with otitis media weighed more and in many cases a great deal more than those without
7923142 if other people experienced the same allure of food theyd be heavy too
7923143 i think what were trying to show is that the effect may persist
7923144 its interesting but i dont think its going to change the eating habits of millions of toddlers
7923145 were keeping a close eye on her because shes got a big appetite
7923146 she can spot a chocolate chip cookie from a mile away
7923147 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7923148 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
7923149 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other
7923150 colonising a continent isnt easy colonising a continent during the ice age is even harder so for early homo sapiens colonising ice age europe a new shared and flashy looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded
7923151 thus during hard times these larger social networks might act like a type of life insurance ensuring exchange and trade among members of the same team
7923152 the road map to peace only moves in one direction and that direction is from the west bank to the mediterranean sea the only thing in the way is israel
7923153 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran

7923158 it was not at all my intention to put nuns on the catwalk
7923159 it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
7923160 we are proud to welcome three new additions to the exilim family of sleek and attractive digital cameras
7923161 the new exilim engine for high speed image processing takes these point and shoot digital cameras to a new level of functionality
7923162 the u s is now losing the war against the taliban
7923163 pakistan may officially be an ally but much of its conduct has effectively made it a major threat to u s strategic interests
7923164 be raised with pakistans government and i will continue to do so
7923165 im not willing to have a long term u s commitment a substantial u s commitment to afghanistan without seeing substantial reform and improvement in the government
7923166 there is a sense of real frustration with the government of president karzai people were expecting gains over time but they arent feeling much
7923167 i think theres got to be a strike on the leadership structure including mullah omar siraj haqqani and gulbuddin hekmatyar
7923168 as the insurgency has become more sophisticated many of the senior leaders continue to exist and they are one of the reasons the insurgency is getting better
7923169 initially we wouldnt even fire back across the pakistan border we changed that were firing back were pursuing and now acting on intelligence we are prepared to use discreet weaponry to take out high value targets
7923170 they want the minimal american presence to help them do that
7923171 i dont pretend to know enough about how that would be involved
7923172 but the bottom line is that as i look at this issue i dont see how we can succeed on our present track
7923173 i did not do anything i did not do anything
7923174 the person in front of meyer was told he would be the last person to speak orlando said meyer said he was upset with that so kerry gave him the ok when he took the mike meyer then asked kerry several questions on amateur video linked from meyers website his questions included why kerry conceded in the 2004 presidential election why not impeach president george w bush now and whether kerry was a member of the skull and bones secret society at yale university
7923175 the person in front of meyer was told he would be the last person to speak orlando said meyer said he was upset with that so kerry gave him the ok
7923176 anything that is complex is not useful and anything that is useful is simple this has been my whole lifes motto
7923177 not positive in the sense of providing more job opportunities to those who get their kicks having sex in front of lights and cameras but positive to society in general
7923178 consider that the amount of pornography has exploded with the onset of the internet age and sexual assaults in canada have plunged dramatically over the last 15 years
7923179 we are currently experiencing the largest run of steelhead half pounders since 2000 as of aug 15 179 364 fish have entered the river half pounders are young steelhead returning to the river in the late summer of their first year in the ocean so named because of their size they stay in the rogue through the winter providing a popular fishery before returning to the ocean in spring the run is especially popular with fly anglers though spinners and worms will produce as well
7923180 for the first time in 40 years salmon and steelhead could soon be swimming their way down the metolius crooked and upper deschutes rivers as a result of new equipment now in advanced stages of construction
7923181 in situ laser processing with leap has provided us the unique ability to purify rare adherent cell types in an efficient automated and sterile manner
7923182 we also believe leap can be a transforming technology in the downstream use of stem cells and their progeny as it has clear potential as a sample preparation system for adherent cell types derived from stem cell populations
7923183 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7923184 its working exactly the way it is supposed to do
7923185 at one point we didnt know what we were going to do we were going to get arrested or maced
7923186 i havent been able to vote for a president yet but this was an epiphany
7923187 a bunch of us were supposed to have a direct action march
7923188 were not going to let them stop you were not going to let them intimidate you but we are emphasizing peace and nonviolence we dont want trouble in denver tonight
7923189 when i saw the tear gas i split i dont need to get beat down
7923190 the spray will fuse your contact lenses to your eyeballs
7923191 we want direct democracy where communities are allowed to make decisions based on our own abilities it takes bottom up organizing to make change it doesnt take a leader we want cooperations not capitalism
7923192 come ready for quick decentralized actions spanning the downtown area at a variety of risk levels
7923193 i tried to get out but it was only when i started crying that they met me out
7923194 denver police made limited use of pepper spray monday night when a protest crowd that had gathered near civic center park refused requests to disperse and suddenly rushed a police safety line about 7 15 p m
7923195 carrying rocks and other items that could be used to threaten public safety
7923196 in order to protect the public when the crowd surged forward two officers deployed their pepper spray and one officer used a pepper ball device
7923197 we have a real problem when underprivileged citizens are forced to spend nights in homeless shelters or in church but the issue of housing is more than just creating affordable homes for people in our community its also about making sure our neighbors have the opportunity to become financially literate in order to maintain the economic stability necessary to stay in their homes
7923198 thats what organizations like fair tide contribute to our community
7923199 fair tide relies on community support and involvement and in turn provides the community with productive and active citizens thats why this partnership with riverrun is so meaningful

7923219 nachdem ich vor drei jahren einen golden retriever club gegr ndet habe ist es nahe gelegen eine solche hundeschau in der obersteiermark zu veranstalten aber es muss sich unter hundebesitzern der region herumsprechen dass es so etwas jetzt ganz in ihrer n he gibt
7923220 er muss auf jeden fall einen g ltigen ahnenpass haben es werden alle ahnenp sse akzeptiert unabh ngig davon von welchem club
7923221 auf der burg kapfenberg hatten wir damals 75 hunde f r die schau in der oberlandhalle wurden bis jetzt 50 hunde angemeldet von den rassen labrador rottweiler cocker spaniel boxer und berner sennenhund k nnten wir noch anmeldungen brauchen

7923236 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
7923237 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
7923238 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
7923239 i am concerned about the audience and acceptance time will tell well see
7923240 they always tried for a fourth judge because it followed the format of the original show pop idol
7923241 we havent had much luck with that working but were gonna give it another try
7923242 im sure simon will get to make the final call
7923243 it takes the fun out of all the hard work i do to push those kids through
7923244 oh yeah always my dad was a union man and so am i this is our last shot at having real change im going to be there
7923245 the thing is people forget that most of these actors are not isolated and rich
7923246 it puts russia of course in opposition to a number of security council resolutions to which it is party most appallingly as a member of the p 5
7923247 we obviously cant allow what russias done to go without there being some consequences
7923248 it simply means that the russian president continues not to honor the commitments that the russians have signed on to
7923249 while there have been some significant russian movements they are not yet living up to the terms of the cease fire agreement
7923250 i had to sell them in order to pursue this case
7923251 what else can i do i am not a pimp a coward to let these men get away with what they did i will sell all of my children if that is what it takes to get justice
7923252 i think that a similar effort to the police effort needs to be launched on a similar scope and scale to address the justice issues we have some real problems with corruption in the prisons here there are 10 links between arrest and putting someone in jail the police own the first four links in the process but if you fix the first four links without addressing the next six it wont work
7923253 if the taliban were still here that rapist would have already been executed by now it would have been a lesson for all
7923254 if there is no law and the government does not listen to peoples complaints then it is better to go back to the taliban era at least then we had justice
7923255 a tip before we go any further voice calls on airplanes will result in chatty passengers who yap their way through an entire six hour flight which is likely to increase the chance of an air rage incident fly at your own risk
7923256 phone calls likely to increase the chance of an air rage incident
7923257 i saw it took off and it was okay until communication with the aircraft was lost
7923258 were still verifying as to what really transpired because this is something very unusual the aircraft and the pilots were all okay before takeoff and everything was normal until that time
7923259 we still do not know what really happened but the last contact we had on the c 130 was at the butuan air base

7923263 compared to europe and asia the north american market is behind the curve
7923264 detroit is largely focused on powertrain technologies such as hybrids or battery powered electric vehicles like the chevrolet volt and less interested in putting fuel saving tips into the infotainment system or gas pedal north american oems have yet to announce an eco friendly technology that operates through a navigation route or that notifies users of inefficient driving
7923265 in a few years its entirely possible that telematics systems will give vehicle manufacturers the capability to re flash powertrain control modules to improve the efficiency of vehicles
7923266 eco telematics also plays a role in hybrid vehicles with routing that optimizes charging of the batteries because of this its crucial for car makers to stay on top of the eco friendly telematics and navigation phenomenon
7923267 in a few years its entirely possible that telematics systems will evolve on the eco front and give vehicle manufacturers the capability to re flash

7923284 shes got to basically put together a jigsaw puzzle and its not going to be easy but everybody will be listening
7923285 you can only achieve so much with words if the conviction isnt there
7923286 people will be watching to see how invested hillary clinton will be in the democratic ticket
7923287 shes going to be a powerful advocate for people maybe we havent closed the deal with
7923288 we have to make sure they know how many delegates are voting for her
7923289 she can say i made history but now its time to move on and there may be the another day
7923290 would be interpreted as very big step toward disunity and for all the obama supporters she cant alienate them because they might be her supporters in a future run

7923293 labour are neglecting a forgotten generation of teenagers its a sad indictment of our broken society that so many are turning to things like drug and alcohol abuse at such a young age
7923294 and these figures only highlight the worst cases the young people that end up in hospital the true toll on teenagers lives is far higher
7923295 inside look at companies from those who know them best
7923296 in 2006 whitling issued himself six checks totaling 23 318 93 in payments not authorized by mr stevens
7923297 we have to wait and see if we get him over on time
7923298 the good thing is that he has been playing regularly and traveling around the world regularly with the u s national team when i first met him he came across as one of these boys who would not be fazed by a great deal he seems quite a confident lad if we can get him over in good time then i have no doubt that he would be involved on sunday at some stage
7923299 we continue to believe that the market has not yet valued either tivos long term prospects for stand alone growth or the potential value from its licensing partners
7923300 and intelligence is the greatest human power i want to prove that we can do anything we want with just the power of humans
7923301 a very very cold coke with lots of ice it gets very hot in the middle of the ocean

7923303 i know it is hard to believe but this is the way it looked when we left even harder to believe im sure nothing is missing
7923304 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7923305 well it is kind of neat now that you mention it
7923306 for besieging the afghan and foreign forces in kabul we have begun the initial work on the main roads leading to kabul from four directions
7923307 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty

7923309 most people pay a flat water rate regardless of usage if you have more bedrooms than people in your home you will benefit from going on to a meter and could cut up to 125 off your annual bill
7923310 a hippo a polyethylene block in your cistern can cut water consumption by an estimated three litres 0 6 gallon per flush theyre relatively inexpensive at 1 95 each hippo the watersaver co uk or biggreensmile com
7923311 its in a spot that people dont go to at night but during the day it amazes me how many people from the other side of town still come out to it during their lunch breaks because its that good i think places like this are kinda like my philosophy on music and how im dealing with it
7923312 its like from the other side of the tracks generally people are afraid to go to that part of town but were telling you stories about what its like on the other side its got a reputation but you still gotta get the music
7923313 the more people get into doing it hip hop via the internet myspace it stops being special at a certain point it starts kind of blending together
7923314 i just want my stuff to be representative of when people took pride in crafting it im kind of content in being the best something and providing the best product even if it aint bringin in a million people
7923315 what do you call those things you draw when youre playing hangman
7923316 first rap i wrote was like i dont give a fuck about a bitch run up in the mmm with the click mmm mm in the crib pistol on my waist just hardcore shit
7923317 i wasnt doin none of that because it doesnt come off as well to go
7923318 my relationship with rap had always been kind of a secretive one till i got older
7923319 have to see each other because coadys left handed its like looking in a mirror in the studio we have a wall between us with a window but we put everything down pretty much live
7923320 with protools the number of tracks is a moot point we stopped recording to tape with the last album most studios you go to now have tape machines there and its like a big giant drink coaster
7923321 every time we put out an album we lose fans anyway because theyre unhappy about us not making the same record but then we get new fans and we lose them with the next record
7923322 people hold chronic low tension for long time periods even when they think theyre relaxed theyre still tense when people are working they breathe much more quickly in their chest and forget to blink at the end of the day theyre exhausted people can become aware of that the bigger tool is biofeedback but there are also little exercises very carefully write your street address backwards with the mouse make each letter about a quarter of an inch high then do it as quickly as possible as youre doing that youll observe that you stiffen your trunk hold your breath and get tight in your neck and shoulders the cheapest cure is to get up and move
7923323 if the mouse is too far away and youre reaching for it youre supporting the weight of the whole arm with your shoulder which leads to fatigue of the large muscles between your shoulder and neck on the upper part of your back the keyboard and mouse should be near elbow height you should provide some sort of support to the forearm which can be as simple as sliding your chair close to the desk edge then moving the mouse and keyboard away from the desk edge to rest the forearms there are devices that attach to the front edge of the desk other problems are carpal tunnel and wrist tendonitis a number of different kinds of mouse have been designed to address that some allow a vertical handshake posture some people do well with a small trackball mouse these enforce a neutral wrist posture
7923324 to be able to type with your arms and wrists unsupported requires a solid core so the arms are supported from the abdominals and the trunk muscles not from the neck and shoulders
7923325 how your body responds to the ergonomic stress of computer use depends on the entire set up the posture you assume when using the computer the duration of time you spend doing it you need to consider the position and height of the monitor position and height of the keyboard location of the mouse if its an external mouse it should be beside the keyboard then theres the height of the desk other considerations are how stiff the keys of the keyboard are to push whether there is a document holder beside the well positioned monitor the eyes should be about a third down from the top of monitor if there is space beside the keyboard for the mouse arm then this will work
7923326 common signs and symptoms of mouse arm are pain in hand wrist shoulder or neck pain under armpit or shoulder blade accompanied by a feeling that your arm is going to come off your body numbness or tingling in fingers or hand and weakness of grasp the three most common technical diagnoses of this condition are tendon thoracic outlet syndrome an impingement of the nerves arteries and or veins that enter the arm or carpal tunnel syndrome an irritation of the recurrent median nerve causing decreasing strength in the hand with muscle wasting treatment is to the muscles and fascia connective tissue and high force or low force chiropractic manipulative therapy to the joints in low force chiropractic manipulation there are no forceful thrusts or pressures on the joint and it is rare to hear snapping or popping of the joints

7923333 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7923334 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7923335 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7923336 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7923337 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7923338 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7923339 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7923340 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7923341 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7923342 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7923343 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7923344 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7923345 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7923346 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7923347 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7923348 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7923349 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7923350 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7923351 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7923352 who are open to doing something on the production side
7923353 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7923354 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7923355 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7923356 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
7923357 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
7923358 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
7923359 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7923360 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7923361 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7923362 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7923363 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7923364 what about the war on the unborn children what about the war that kills over 3 000 children every day in our country alone one third of those of us who were conceived after roe v wade were violently killed in the name of choice
7923365 also im getting older i mean im 25 so im not old old but that 14 year old is going to be able to come up and be the next generation of pro life leadership
7923366 they train you in how to argue with anyone and prove them wrong
7923367 to represent the babies that will never have a voice
7923368 but theyre also engaging in child abuse there are minors here who are being brainwashed and manipulated in ways that are most disturbing
7923369 if we look at history and what things caused such a change and such a stir in our society pictures had a huge part in it
7923370 when you think about the picture from the vietnam war of the kid running away from the bomb before that wars were just conceptual there was no real visualization when people finally saw what war did more people were anti war
7923371 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7923372 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7923373 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7923374 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7923375 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7923376 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7923377 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7923378 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7923379 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7923380 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7923381 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7923382 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7923383 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7923384 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7923385 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7923386 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7923387 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7923388 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7923389 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7923390 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7923391 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7923392 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7923393 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7923394 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7923395 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7923396 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7923397 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations

7923405 indeed the drama of the saloon is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centreline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
7923406 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
7923407 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage

7923409 sen obama needs to close the sale with voters who want a democrat but because of sen mccains strength at this point they dont want this democrat
7923410 eight weeks ago sen barack obama was on top in all three of these key swing states and that would make his election almost a sure thing times have changed and the election is now very much a toss up in these states sen obama needs this convention to give his campaign a jump start

7923433 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies

7923504 within a day of the successful impeachment of musharraf or his resignation
7923505 the only surprise is that it took as little as a week after musharraf quit as president for their alliance in pakistans ruling coalition to unravel
7923506 t he judges were not restored on august 19 instead the presidential elections were announced for september 6 and the ppp announced the candidature of asif ali zardari in the election
7923507 sharif said his party had tried its best to keep the coalition intact despite zardari repeatedly reneging on his promise to restore the judges in the interests of democracy and giving the country a stable government sharif has held out the assurance that his party will play the role of a constructive opposition that will not try to place hurdles in the path of the ppp government
7923508 there will be efforts to form new alliances and the pro musharraf pakistan muslim league quaid party is expected to play a major role once again there will be a tussle between the ppp and the pml n to gain power in punjab which is currently ruled by pml n leading to more friction
7923509 the seven month long alliance between the ppp and the pml n has finally come to an end this would pain many who believed that an understanding between the two mainstream parties alone could strengthen democracy and steer the country out of the serious economic political and security crisis it has inherited from the previous administration while working together both sides have indulged in actions that contributed to the parting of ways both are within their right to criticize each others policies inside and outside parliament but they must do nothing that upsets the applecart u nless the ppp and the pml n display the tolerance for one another that they failed to do in the past maintain good working relations and their leaders learn to act like political rivals rather than personal enemies those waiting in the wings might not take long to give the politicians a surprise
7923510 we are confident that zardari in his capacity as president will play a crucial role in resolving the problems haunting the country t he ppp will become a formidable force and that is why people are expecting rapid action for addressing challenges like price hike s unemployment lawlessness and economic slowdown the party enjoying all powers will have no excuse not to take action on these problems and that is why it has become imperative for its leadership to start doing loud thinking about how to proceed
7923511 except for a handful of sheepish musharraf loyalists the entire pakistani nation has heaved a sigh of relief at the final disappearance from national scene of a nero like power hungry and vision less ruler whose only qualification was to make national institutions subservient to the dictates of distant imperialist forces
7923512 focus appeared to be on the distribution of booty the common man can understand the compulsions of such rulers but in the face of the hardships of life he is probably running out of patience
7923513 twenty years after zardari shot to political fame when his late wife benazir bhutto became the first female muslim prime minister of an islamic country he is again battling his past the 54 year old former businessman has spent more than half his 20 year political career in prison in pakistan fighting corruption charges and most of his recent past in exile fighting off similar allegations in international courts in the wake of his wifes assassination and the decision by former general pervez musharraf to step down as president last week there has never been a more pressing moment to present his side of the story
7923514 paints a picture of a man with multiple and severe physical and mental health problems
7923515 dementia major depressive disorder and post traumatic stress disorder problems stemming in part from being tortured while imprisoned in pakistan
7923516 zardari could remember neither the birthdays of his wife and children nor more than a handful of facts from two short stories he was read
7923517 had suicidal thoughts but had not made any suicid al gestures
7923518 i actually do mind not because you cant sit next to me or that you shouldnt read but just because i want to write a big fat novel yet the words are not coming
7923519 yes when i was your age that must have been ages ago but still it could be relevant for you
7923520 if you want to hear my story i will tell it to you now
7923521 i was twenty something and i had just finished university not many girls finished university back then yet i was one of the privileged fews i was sitting right here when this man came out of nowhere and sat next to me with this huge book he asked me the same question as i asked you i babbled on about not knowing what to do in life and that i had tried to write something sensible down on a piece of paper which one day could become a novel perhaps but that for some reason i never succeed in penning down my first sentence he stopped me eventually because he believed he had opened pandoras box and i would never stop talking then he told me something which i would never forget
7923522 oh my im talking on and on again well he told me to stop thinking when i write and let words flow on their own just pick one word out of a dictionary form a sentence with it and a story automatically will develop
7923523 well i was sceptical at first and he noticed that he then explained that it might not work but at least it would open your eyes that much of the words in dictionaries arent words you use in daily conversation and that a true novelist should not try to sound eloquent but should write in the tongue the author himself speaks i did not understand him and before i could ask for more advice he had to go and i was left alone on this bench i pondered about what he said for days
7923524 yea sorry my mind was thinking about what he said to you
7923525 good then i leave you thinking and i will pick up your newest novel in a store one day tony thompsons
7923526 hey wait how did you interpret what he said hello dont leave me here all alone

7923536 as a result they dont enjoy nearly as good a reputation there as companies that entered the region early such as louis vuitton lvmhf or giorgio armani
7923537 the 2008 report finds that campus leaders value sustainability they speak about it plan for it hire staff to support it and the campuses they lead are steadily becoming greener models for the wider society
7923538 at the same time the educational curricula to prepare students for a post college world influenced by climate change are not keeping pace on most campuses the business leaders and facilities managers appear to be making greater strides towards sustainability than their faculty peers
7923539 this report card tells us there is a widening gap between where higher education actually is on teaching sustainability versus where it should be
7923540 given the environmental challenges and opportunities this generation will face i find this cause for deep concern and am committed to working with our partners to address this on both state and federal levels
7923541 the nwf report card is the gold standard for charting the sustainability movement in higher education coverage of both operational and academic programs is particularly important strongly recommended reading for administrators faculty and students
7923542 the campus environment 2008 report card reveals just how well institutions of higher learning are preparing students for the environmental challenges they will face in the 21st century
7923543 many of the men and women who will lead our businesses educational institutions and government agencies in the next 20 years are in college now
7923544 we need to offer todays college students the kind of academic and professional preparation that will ready them to envision and create a healthier and more sustainable world

7923564 obviously the most important question is is this person prepared to be president second most important question from my perspective is can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally and the third criteria for me i think was independence i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking

7923590 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
7923591 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
7923592 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7923593 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7923594 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7923595 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined

7923597 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design

7923880 i think you really have increasingly in parliament two visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times and and thats something im going to have to reflect on
7923881 we have been under the threat of an election for at least the last two years from mr dion

7923908 neckties are in increasing demand as our unemployment rate goes up

7923911 while we are looking forward to all of the plays in the series we are especially excited about the katrina week where we examine a number of plays written in the aftermath of hurricane katrina
7923912 these provide background to our first mainstage production of the year
7923913 an anchor institution that contributes vitally to the quality of life in new jersey
7923914 if they are there then that is what the plan would be
7923915 might realize they can stay home or even vote for mccain and still not derail obamas path to the presidency
7923916 the masters suffer from debilitating medical conditions that were made worse by the stress of this lengthy case
7923917 their valuable medical marijuana was taken away and killed in violation of colorado law
7923918 its been a real struggle but were not giving up on it
7923919 im really excited to be going to misano in such good shape and leading the championship last year the race was a huge disappointment for us a very low point of the season and especially sad because it happened in front of my home fans but this time things are very different weve had two fantastic races in a row and we are feeling very strong and very confident we are out to make up for 2007 misano is so close to my home town of tavullia that i know there will be an army of italian fans there and i hope its going to be a great party for all of them last year there was some terrible weather before the race as well so i really hope that this year we have sunshine and we can enjoy a fantastic race by the sea
7923920 after the disaster of brno im going to misano with the belief and the will that everything goes much better and that were able to score a positive result in my teams second home grand prix im riding well at the moment and in the post race test in the czech republic we were able to shave off a few tenths that will be vital for the next gp misano is a small track for motogp but it is safe last year i won in 250cc so my only memories of it are good ones
7923921 last year we arrived in misano with a 60 point disadvantage to stoner and now we are 50 ahead so the situation is completely reversed and obviously thats great for us having said that we still have six difficult races left and there are circuits coming up where we know our rivals will be very strong misano is one of the places where last year we were not so bad so it could be one of the places we can fight it is difficult to overtake but i expect and hope for another good show valentinos targets havent changed since the start of the season the first priority is to be on the podium which is even more crucial at this stage and when possible fight to win those objectives remains the same regardless of the points situation
7923922 we go to misano in good spirits but knowing that we cant afford a repeat of the last two races where our performance has been completely dictated by the tyres especially brno hopefully misano will be another story because its a completely different kind of circuit it is not as fast it is flat and last year michelin were competitive there we did a lot of work on the tyres in the test at brno and found something with durability on the front and a solution for the rear that helps under acceleration hopefully we can carry those improvements through to this weekend because jorge is riding well this is a circuit he likes and we saw earlier in the season what he is capable of if he has the necessary tools

7923936 russian and georgian media reported several days ago that israel decided to stop its support for georgia after moscow made it clear to jerusalem and washington that russia would respond to continued aid for georgia by selling advanced anti aircraft systems to syria and iran

7923939 ballard e i suoi colleghi hanno dato il calcio dinizio della sfida delle fuel cell con inizialmente pochissimi soldi hanno dimostrato come la fuel cell potesse essere migliorata resa compatta e potente a costi contenuti e che leconomia dellidrogeno era unidea di lungo periodo a cui i governi dovrebbero lavorare
7923940 dubito che vedr mai unauto a idrogeno in un concessionario
7923941 le flotte cambiare i veicoli militari i taxi auto da noleggio

7923946 i have received e mails from people across the country particularly about the relays they all say more or less the same thing the dropped batons were reflective of a lack of preparation lack of professionalism and of leadership i agree
7923947 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7923948 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
7923949 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different
7923950 colonising a continent isnt easy colonising a continent during the ice age is even harder so for early homo sapiens colonising ice age europe a new shared and flashy looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded he said
7923951 thus during hard times these larger social networks might act like a type of life insurance ensuring exchange and trade among members of the same team

7923956 georgia did not understand our problems they didnt understand the abkhaz people she said
7923957 finally we have achieved our dream thank you russia a tearful old woman in the abkhaz capital sukhumi told russian television car horns sounding in the background

7923959 an important lesson is that the library is in many ways falling off the radar screens of faculty although scholars report general respect for libraries and librarians the library is increasingly disintermediated from their actual research processes
7923960 in the case of the library both the library leadership as well as individual librarians should be reaching out to faculty members formally and informally to understand the nature of their teaching and research projects and how their needs are being met or could be met better
7923961 and thus a nation of loud and proud rednecks was born
7923962 the economy will struggle to keep going when it cant get the skills that it needs
7923963 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
7923964 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
7923965 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
7923966 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
7923967 being recognized as the best corner in the game isnt the biggest deal for me
7923968 ill talk to former raiders and current green bay packers corner
7923969 for me the main thing has been being able to put my team in position to win games
7923970 when i came here we were coming off a super bowl and i figured automatically we were going to just go right back
7923971 asomugha is terrific and when deangelos head is right hes up there from a skill perspective with the best of them
7923972 nnamdi plays with great intelligence he understands how to play the position he may not be the most gifted physically whereas
7923973 but nnamdi talks about reading routes how the quarterback drops things coaches talk about a lot of times that players dont get he gets the cerebral side of playing the position
7923974 everybody knows were one of the highest paid secondaries in the league and with that comes a lot of responsibility
7923975 im first and foremost the guy whos barking down everybodys throat to do that
7923976 i dont see a better corner tandem than myself and nnamdi but you have to prove it in this league
7923977 my first year starting 2005 i got a lot of balls thrown my way
7923978 my second year starting i was able to get a lot of picks eight in 2006 but once they realized youre going to make plays in man to man they dont have to throw your way
7923979 now we have two guys on either side who can make plays
7923980 you go to oakland or green bay those are the two teams in the league that mainly play man to man
7923981 its tough but we pride ourselves on it its not like were sitting back there in zone
7923982 i couldnt ask for a better situation i feel like i can go check anybody ive been doing it for years and nnamdi can go check anybody thats going to make us better

7923985 the companies that built this dike did a terrible job
7923986 they dont deserve a bailout and doing that would just encourage more shoddy construction besides the dumb people who live here should never have built their homes on a floodplain
7923987 you might have heard an alternative version of this story circulating around the fed
7923988 the companies that built this dike did a terrible job

7923991 must buy it now all of it now and it must be the absolute top of the line item
7923992 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm

7923998 i had asked for some clarifications from the indian premier league on the doping case of asif and would be traveling to india next week to attend a tribunal hearing
7923999 the difference in traces of banned substance found in asifs sample was not surprising and he would get a fair hearing from the tribunal
7924000 there is a major discrepancy in the two samples of asif which came out positive and in such cases the player has a chance to be cleared
7924001 there is no demonstrable need for it and the nras argument that there is is just preposterous
7924002 what tourist is going to get up at six oclock in the bloody morning to go shopping theyd rather be in the surf
7924003 and late at night theyd rather be in a nightclub or restaurant than a supermarket
7924004 seven years ago these little sookiess got their nose in the extended trading hours trough by starting with one application on the gold coast then extended it to the sunshine coast then to brisbane and away they went
7924005 ever since they have been criss crossing the nation targeting regional areas and pushing for trading hours extensions that quite frankly just arent needed
7924006 zum gl ck passiert das weit weg am kaukasus und die georgier sind ja auch keine guten hatten sie doch versucht sezessionistische territorien zur ckzuerobern
7924007 of what she and bill clinton did to denigrate obama
7924008 and yet more disappointment for those who honestly thought obama was a liberal democrat like me
7924009 we have to vote for obama because the alternative is no alternative at all
7924010 intimacy blossoms when we confront our emotions and invest in our relationships its not always easy but its far more rewarding in the long run
7924011 when poor judging happens to you youre told to shut up and not say anything because of what will happen to you or what will happen to the sport
7924012 if this is truly what taekwondo is about maybe taekwondo shouldnt be in the olympics maybe they should fix it
7924013 unacceptable could mean anything from we didnt file the papers properly to we didnt use the right color pencil
7924014 under the wtf competition rules we should have been notified about the decision the criteria the methodology used what evidence was presented and what referees were reviewing it we were not
7924015 we were threatened not to protest at this event i think that needs to be said we were made to sign a document not to protest for the betterment of taekwondo it was a very big thing there was a table you went up to the table and you signed the document you signed it in front of the secretary general of the wtf and you gave him the document
7924016 it is not an agreement i would call it a resolution
7924017 a resolution on fair play it was do your best to ensure fair play and judging appealing is up to them its their right and their rule they can appeal
7924018 participants in wtf olympic coach seminar adopt resolution on fair play
7924019 respect and accept the judgment and decisions of the refereeing and technical officials in all taekwondo competitions
7924020 the wtf wanted everybody to have more self control and if they want to make a protest take the correct procedure actually not to jump up and down and make a ruckus raise a lot of noise
7924021 take the correct procedure to go about it file the complaint and then theyll decide
7924022 wtf officials dont think about the repercussions until after they make a mistake
7924023 they know the power we have as a family and bringing limelight to our sport
7924024 there are bad calls all the time this is one of the times that it happened to me it normally doesnt but it happened it sucks
7924025 wtf officials dont think about the repercussions until after they make a mistake
7924026 they know the power we have as a family and bringing limelight to our sport
7924027 this is sports its never been a political statement on my end
7924028 i dont agree with everything that our government does and i dont agree with everything the russian government does
7924029 when i was a little girl there was no wnba so the olympics was the highest thing and in my opinion its still the highest thing in basketball
7924030 the dream of playing in the olympics is something ive carried around with me for 30 years
7924031 if you play in this country live in this country and you grow up in the heartland and you put on a russian uniform you are not a patriotic person
7924032 i dont expect everybody to understand or jump on my bandwagon
7924033 i know how i feel about my country im very proud of what america represents to the world but this is a basketball game this is not life or death the real heroes are over in iraq and afghanistan im playing a game

7924038 by condon and condon this book has given me a much better insight as im finalizing our plans someone here suggested it really helped me so ill pass that along
7924039 yes of course st fama and st french say so
7924040 it is practically and financially untenable to hold the 2014 winter olympic games less than 20 miles from a zone of conflict particularly when the prospective host country has played a significant role in the escalation of that conflict
7924041 it is premature to make judgments about how events happening today might sit with an event taking place six years from now
7924042 all our efforts here in china are spent on learning from these wonderful beijing games so that we can enhance our offer for the olympic movement
7924043 at sochi 2014 our focus is to deliver an excellent and innovative games that will inspire the world we are on track to achive this
7924044 russia must realize that its actions in georgia will not be ignored by the international community
7924045 following a course that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
7924046 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a government elected by its people
7924047 i just stayed calm and had a great time out there
7924048 after the all around i was excited to have made the floor finals and a bronze medal feels great
7924049 today i concentrated only on my moves not the medals
7924050 i felt that i had a very normal performance without surprises and that is why i got a silver medal
7924051 im disappointed especially since third place had a fall and i made both of mine
7924052 i cant change her score the judges made up their minds
7924053 i definitely had to pull myself together a little bit the last few days
7924054 im sure someday ill appreciate what i did i still have to get to that step
7924055 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
7924056 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16
7924057 all passports are valid for all gymnasts competing in the beijing olympic games
7924058 stringent control measures are taken at the time of athlete accreditation for all official fig competitions further all athlete ages for the beijing olympic games are consistent with the fig records for all past fig competitions
7924059 they are 12 14 years old max and they line them up for the world and having the government back them
7924060 im sure bela saw injuries but if you were injured bela didnt want to see it you had to deal with it i was intimidated he looked down on me he was 6 feet something and i was 4 foot nothing
7924061 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
7924062 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is
7924063 they voted me one of the top five olympians in all time some of them are dead but they invited the other ones to go to the olympics but not me
7924064 i won seven events if they had the 50m freestyle back then which they do now i probably would have won that too
7924065 but as soon as the swimming was over and michael phelps didnt break my record every time i went to beach volley they put my face on the volleyballs
7924066 hes almost identical to me hes a world record holder in all these events so he is dominating the events just like i did
7924067 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
7924068 the opium flood waters in afghanistan have started to recede
7924069 this is a remarkable accomplishment the first time it happens in the countrys modern history
7924070 until they all face the full force of the law the opium economy will continue to prosper with impunity and the taliban will continue to profit from it
7924071 no use trying to escape right now the spell is fresh and the material i used is strong rock with a shinki core not many things can break it
7924072 well we were testing you we wanted to see if you were able to best the three of us and since you did we can call you a master after all you used all three of your abilities against us your swordsmanship your magic and your martial arts

7924077 and since you bested me you passed the ritual our family used to make sure you are captain material so when our village is restore you will be the captain of the guard but until then i still have the title
7924078 nuin mane the cage falls apart leaving the shinki core standing so this was a test for me to be declared a master
7924079 well the fact that you were able to learn sixteen spells in less then 6 hours is an incredible feat and there is one more thing to do now
7924080 mixture of ki and mana warriors of the past welcome the cub as a master bear blade special technique master mark

7924087 it was strange i didnt have that reoccurring dream once but i did have a different dream it was a world without the magos and i was actually feeling happy for once and our village was restored to normal but i know that cant happen because mother and maria are gone along with a lot of people from village
7924088 i was hoping that it wasnt true little maria and karin taking from us forever
7924089 that was my wifes name from what those magos bastards said i lost my wife to one of us
7924090 it was keith he aligned himself with the magos and from what he said the goal of the magos is to purify the world by getting rid of women

7924115 a surprise appearance by the exhumed remains of lyndon johnson
7924116 you hear so many accidents of the cars going out of control and all they have here is plastic pots
7924117 were going to roll the dice and eat lunch here today
7924118 its like an ongoing nightmare and no one is sure when were going to wake up
7924119 thank you sara chan and thank you hima chan thats very kind of you to say so why did you three come in through the back door
7924120 we were going to get ready to travel to saras and himas home they said it was close to here
7924121 well ill make sure ben knows that you all left but i dont know when you will come back
7924122 i guess the boy has left i knew if i moved us close enough to their city the kunoichi couldnt resist taking him home
7924123 i only thought of a few things the winter gear the proximity to their city and the fact that trent was old enough to make a name for himself in this world without their father around ben has had to take up the position and wasnt allowing trent to grow and flourish just look at how strong they have gotten in the past few days
7924124 its not a problem in fact when he wakes up i plan to literally throw ben into the bath so he stops stinking up my house
7924125 well its big enough in there even though it looks small from the outside there is coffee over there cedric san
7924126 hm coffee oh i forgot i even had that good thing that coffee last a long time in a can
7924127 id say about five months old looks at ashleys relieved face its not like i keep things in this house for five years thats just wrong
7924128 there are only pictures here that are older then five years most of them are pictures of people that are unique
7924129 well its going to be a while until ben wakes up so i think ill challenge fang to a game of chess that should take 3 days
7924130 gooood moorrrning its about damn time we wake up im tired of going to sleep when you do why the hell did you have to curse me like justin and roco
7924131 i did that because it was tradition of the bear blade style notices ashley is awake good morning miss ashley what happened to me last thing i remember was trying to make a plan to attack the magos headquarters all over the world
7924132 you lost consciousness because of the dark bear spell cedric san said that after casting it you will be able to fight with monstrous strength but the price is that you lose three days of your life
7924133 so thats what that warning was about the scroll said that those who use the spell will lose time guess i now know that its three days which means as long as i count on my allies i can use it notices ashleys long hair are you sure it was only three days your hair looks like its been months
7924134 thats not a nice thing to say master ang and cedric san both said it was three days to the minute and the cause of your unconscious state was that dark bear spell
7924135 what happened to the fiery inferno that was out there before
7924136 actually its just called snow havent you ever seen snow before
7924137 no i havent it never snowed back in akamaru village it was a nice climate there all year long i wonder how trent reacted when he saw this wonderful view where is he i want someone to spar with
7924138 thats not possible he left with the kunoichi and artemis left while we were on siren so there are only master ang cedric san yourself and i here now oh i should go tell cedric san you are awake
7924139 stay in there for a while until you dont stink anymore
7924140 what a way to wake up being yelled at by your masters and being thrown into water notices the big bath thats in a big tub inside the house the closest thing we had to this was the spring that we built around a building around
7924141 thats just not right how the hell am i suppose to get out when i have no clothes to get into oh well might as well not let time slip away time for a little water training
7924142 where did he go to im sure i just heard him in here
7924143 i should be asking you that why were you gasping for air like you were drowning
7924144 i was holding my breath i use to swim around in the lake back in the valley it was very relaxing but was very cold but this water is nice and warm
7924145 well here are some new clothes this way you dont have to wear out your old ones
7924146 well i can only guess that whatever the reason is im going to need reaper in a few minutes
7924147 that is some reflex catching the scabbard and blocking my attack with it you are a new generation of master tri class master
7924148 thats his father and what was cedric san saying about a tri class master
7924149 long time no see master ang mister law thank you for also training my son
7924150 hiroto you know that your son is a new kind of master in this world correct he mastered ki control he uses magic with ease he is a martial artist a swordsman and a magician
7924151 i always thought he would resent magic but hearing that my oldest has developed so much in a few days im surprised you arent wanting to settle down and start a new life notices ashley what the hell that girls face over there looks like maria but with longer hair who is she
7924152 her name is ashley you taught me never to let my mind wander in battle father you should practice what you preached

7924154 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
7924155 russias actions are totally absolutely unacceptable i would be very direct with president putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct
7924156 democratic presidential candidate barack obama said he had talked with rice and saakashvili to condemn russias recent actions he said top diplomats from the u s the european union and the united nations should become directly involved in mediating the military conflict
7924157 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin the process of negotiations immediately obama said in a statement
7924158 oh im with you guys i dont like that big bad russia
7924159 sounds like you are giving us a sneak peak of steamy tales from the boudoir m

7924162 georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis

7924511 activity detection in conversational sign language video for mobile telecommunication
7924512 low data transmission rates on u s cellular networks combined with limited processing power on mobile devices have so far prevented real time video transmission with enough frames per second that it could be used to transmit sign language communication rates on united states cellular networks allow about one tenth of the data rates common in places such as europe and asia
7924513 the team tried different ways to get comprehensible sign language on low resolution video they discovered that the most important part of the image to transmit in high resolution is around the face this is not surprising since eye tracking studies have already shown that people spend the most time looking at a persons face while they are signing
7924514 the current version of mobileasl uses a standard video compression tool to stay within the data transmission limit future versions will incorporate custom tools to get better quality the team developed a scheme to transmit the persons face and hands in high resolution and the background in lower resolution now they are working on another feature that identifies when people are moving their hands to reduce battery consumption and processing power when the person is not signing
7924515 the goal of the mobileasl project is to increase accessibility by making the mobile telecommunications network available to the signing deaf community video cell phones enable deaf users to communicate in their native language american sign language asl
7924516 by recognizing activity in the conversational video we can drop the frame rate during less important segments without significantly harming intelligibility thus reducing the computational burden in this work we quantify the power savings from dropping the frame rate during less important segments of the conversation

7924518 it would take two decades for them to recoup the cost of remodeling this building economically remodeling is not a good deal for the united way
7924519 having examined the economic forces united way is facing if the building cant be sold then their best option would be to demolish the building and build a new headquarters next door

7924526 ive been doing a lot of interviews and stage shows and half the questions are like will mgs4 be coming out on 360 or other formats and in the near future i hope theyll ask me about metal gear about us about our future projects and will stop caring about the hardware but you know what kind of disturbs me sometimes because a lot of people ask me about this ps3 360 question is that its not about the hardware i want people to look at the game itself sometimes i even feel like it should be on a pc so that people dont ask me about hardware and platforms
7924527 thing again man i feel old can you hear my bones creaking
7924528 we spent an enormous amount of money and time and a full time unit of people looking under every stone it wasnt like we did not know anything about her
7924529 and we thought her position on this was pretty reasonable
7924530 ive tried not to have long discussions about short lists long lists but ive said publicly before and i will repeat again that you know senator clinton would have been on anybodys shortlist and so i took her very seriously
7924531 no meetings no conversations no requests for information no real consideration whatsoever
7924532 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7924533 both because she wants a democrat in the white house and because she does not want to be blamed if we dont have one
7924534 she wants to go above and beyond to ensure that if it doesnt happen nobody points the finger at her
7924535 shes emerged from this campaign as an even more powerful force and shes going to map out a strategy where she can make a difference in peoples lives
7924536 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7924537 nevertheless not one market is showing a positive return over the past 12 months and seven of the metro areas are reporting declines in excess of 20
7924538 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
7924539 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later

7924542 there are a lot of things we could be doing to help these whales that we apparently are not willing to do
7924543 delay appears to be due to baseless objections raised by white house officials including officials in the office of the vice president
7924544 heres a crystal clear example of this administration impeding any progress on endangered species that might impact big business
7924545 someone in the vice presidents office apparently has decided that its not worth the cost of slowing down ships to save whales
7924546 however we are confident the process will provide an approach that will achieve our shared goals

7924548 one of the dogs we use now was from a pound because he was unmanageable
7924549 but in pairing detection of fecal samples with the reward of a tennis ball it channels their motivations and they become really well behaved dogs
7924550 but im up for it im ready to take it on
7924551 i have my own style i think thats why they brought me on
7924552 its obviously a really successful show so its really their choice what they want to do
7924553 i dont necessarily feel like we need to sweep them but i feel like we need to win the series
7924554 because of the media and the fans theres more energy or electricity in the ballpark but you cant bring in a pitcher an inning earlier

7924557 its become quite obvious we do something now or it will be an irreversible trend with catastrophic consequences the only chance of it being a bubble is if we lack the political commitment to drive emission reductions worldwide and if we do that we might as well forget about any environmental effort whatsoever because climate change is hitting us hard and the trend is likely to accelerate i think its very unlikely political support will go away

7924583 aint it funny how the way you feel shows on your face and no matter how you try to hide it it states your case
7924584 i meet other players who played under him and we have all got our own stories but he was a genius an absolute genius and certainly the best manager i played under without a shadow of a doubt
7924585 i just feel very lucky like other players who played under him to have had that opportunity he was a genius and he has still left his mark on the football club
7924586 we were there a few weeks ago and you still feel he is around the building somewhere i am sure he is in spirit anyway
7924587 i dont know i was young i was raw in my time at forest im not sure im not sure what he would have said to be honest
7924588 he would probably have thought i would be the last person to become a manager because my own off the field life wasnt exactly perfect
7924589 what you have to remember about alex ferguson and brian clough to be fair to them people talk about that side of it and they were very hard but also very fair
7924590 hard and fair is fine with me cloughie and alex ferguson were very hard with me but i have to say when i look back now generally they were fair with me as well and thats what i try to do with my own players
7924591 dont get me wrong we are all different it depends what time of day you might catch somebody you might catch somebody on a bad day
7924592 but i look back at brian clough particularly when he questioned a lot of my stuff i had one or two incidents with him and i look back now to when he sent me back from jersey for a drinking incident and he was spot on

7924594 obviously she knew while shes the victim she clearly didnt stand in the way of the cover up
7924595 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
7924596 the question for her as well as for him is what is their foundation what gives them a platform to engage in public issues
7924597 their big challenge is convincing people that they will continue to be active in politics and theyre going to continue to have a voice
7924598 an imperfect man with a truly progressive vision who spoke to and for those whom others ignored yes that is who i supported
7924599 an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections and was seeking to redeem himself to those closest to him yes that is who i supported
7924600 she knew president with this bomb waiting to go off she did she kinda loses my sympathy

7924602 there was anguish excruciating anguish for her in dealing with this
7924603 she was angry and furious and everything but at one point she had to make a choice do i kick him out or do we have a 30 year marriage that can be rebuilt

7924663 this offseason has been about me taking on my blocks better coach harris showed me some new techniques that was really my only concern i have always been a good open field player now i am ready to see how much i have improved when we play dothan friday in our season opener
7924664 auburn has been coming on strong they are really the only new school to start showing me a lot of interest well them and arkansas coach willis at auburn told me that there is a good chance that i am going to get an offer in the middle of the season that is what vandy told me too but then they ended up offering me a lot of the schools want to see how much weight i can put on i started out at 175 and i have worked myself up to 200 pounds i am just over 6 3
7924665 i have already been offered by ole miss vandy north carolina state and central florida
7924666 most likely i am going up to ole miss this weekend to see them play memphis and i am going on an official visit to central florida when they play south florida
7924667 the thing with me is that ole miss was really strong but my mom never got to see the campus i am 60 of the decision and my mom is 40 my mom plans on going with me this weekend to ole miss though i am not going to make my decision until my mom sees the school first i talked to coach dickerson about it and he knows the situation there is about a 70 80 chance i will be there this weekend with my mother
7924668 probably the top three would be vandy north carolina state and central florida
7924669 overall they have a good education program in sports medicine carries a 3 9 gpa 24 act plus it is an sec school i also have a good relationship with coach belin the biggest thing is that he does not tolerate profanity i do not either
7924670 i like the location because it is separated from the city so you do not have to worry about the crime
7924671 the thing i like about state is that coach mccullan is real into it it is not all about business with him he is down to earth and goes out of his way to establish a personal relationship with you
7924672 i like auburn because of their location and the number of big games they play in my family could see me play if i went to auburn
7924673 the thing i like about ole miss is that it is far enough from home where i feel like i am away from home but at the same time it is close enough where my parents can still come see me play i just want to get away from home and experience life outside of alabama

7924681 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7924682 it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
7924683 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different
7924684 colonising a continent isnt easy colonising a continent during the ice age is even harder so for early homo sapiens colonising ice age europe a new shared and flashy looking technology might serve as one form of social glue by which larger social networks were bonded he said

7924712 your service was only so so but since you are obviously having problems with our language and i will give you the benefit of the doubt and give you the full 15
7924713 however i will be taking out the 14 million a year our country spends on food stamps government assisted housing and welfare benefits to your families
7924714 in addition to the 20 million a year you steal from our economy to send to your families in mexico so they dont have to work
7924715 add to that the 10 million a year our school systems have to pay to educate your children who you refuse to teach english as every immigrant in this country who entered before you has had to
7924716 and also the 200 billion in taxes you dont have to pay to support all these programs you take advantage of

7924731 sure hillarys fat and waddly and screechy and gives pantsuits a bad name
7924732 reports of strife between negotiators for sen hillary clinton and sen barack obama are exaggerated
7924733 multiple sources in both campaigns have described the negotiations as relatively free of acrimony
7924734 my sources say the obama campaign was enthusiastic about the idea of putting clintons name in nomination having independently reached the conclusion that it was the best way to honor her achievement and do more to win over her supporters
7924735 the conversations with her folks were very cordial and weve been able to work very closely with them as we unify this party we couldnt be happier about how things are going with senator clinton and her team
7924736 hillary clintons attempt tacitly to take over the obama victory
7924737 i thought journalists were supposed to uncover the facts and report the story not decide on the story and then interpret the facts to accommodate their storyline

7924778 during a live appearance on cnbc buffett said ripples of the credit crunch are continuing to cause problems in financial businesses and the economy
7924779 earlier this year he said a financial crisis reveals which players have been
7924780 buffett said its likely more banks will fail especially in areas where there was a real estate bubble and the bank got heavily involved in the housing market
7924781 the median national home price declined 7 1 percent from a year ago to 212 400 and the inventory of homes for sale rose to 4 67 million which would take 11 2 months to clear at the current sales pace that matched a record set in april
7924782 in the bay area the median sank 21 2 percent to 663 190
7924783 additional waves of foreclosures are likely because thousands of alternative documentation loans and other exotic mortgages are scheduled to reset to higher monthly payments in the coming months said esmael adibi director of the anderson center for economic research at chapman university in orange in addition sales havent increased enough yet to substantially reduce the high inventory across the state
7924784 there were 124 487 active listings in california last month down 5 4 percent from 131 569 a year ago
7924785 adibi doesnt expect the market to stabilize for at least another year
7924786 ken rosen chairman of the fisher center for real estate and urban economics at uc berkeley had a more bearish take on mondays numbers
7924787 it doesnt reflect a recovering housing market it reflects a broken housing market
7924788 its a reflection of the fact that foreclosed homes are being liquidated at very low prices
7924789 indeed san diego research firm mda dataquick reported that 44 8 percent of all the transactions in july were foreclosure resales up from 7 6 percent a year ago the trade group didnt provide a statewide figure but appleton young said it exceeded 50 percent in certain areas
7924790 rosen believes that investors not actual intended occupants are buying up many if not most of the distressed properties in the hardest hit areas that will do little to stabilize the markets in those areas especially if prices fall further and foreclosures continue to climb he said
7924791 nationwide despite the third monthly sales increase this year the number of unsold single family homes and condominiums rose to 4 67 million the highest number since 1968 when the realtors group started tracking the data
7924792 until the inventory level is reduced to more normal levels analysts say the housing slump is likely to persist the inventory level is being driven higher by a massive wave of mortgage foreclosures

7924863 in fact the ability to start out upon your own impulses is fundamental to the gift of keeping going upon your own terms not to mention the further and more fulfilling gift of getting started all over again never resting upon the oars of success or in the doldrums of disappointment getting started again in art and in life it seems to me this is the essential rhythm

7924899 this sort of sudden removal of a persons benefits rarely gt gt gt happens

7925021 there was a strong suspicion that it came from that particular maple leaf foods product that we had on hand
7925022 that had left a small group of staff to effectively be operating the program and we decided in our best interests to shut down the camp a few days early
7925023 our inspectors have gone and done a regular inspection that they would do when an outbreak is notified which is looking at the food handling practices

7925037 permintaan tersebut wajar ditunaikan jika berkemampuan memandangkan peralatan tersebut telah terlalu lama digunakan
7925038 saya tidak pernah mengalami masalah dengan isteri saya kerana kehidupan kami amat sederhana dan ringkas dia tidak pernah meminta dibelikan pakaian yang mahal atau barang kemas menghiasi tubuhnya
7925039 baginya wang yang ada itu boleh digunakan untuk perkara yang lebih berfaedah
7925040 apa guna kehidupan yang mewah dengan rumah dihiasi perabot yang eksklusif jika diri dikelilingi bebanan hutang

7925044 the democrat energy plan is to drive small cars and wait for the wind well this reminds me of the people of france who were starving and the queen was told that the people had no bread and her response was to say let them eat cake

7925050 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
7925051 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
7925052 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
7925053 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
7925054 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
7925055 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

7925156 this is the first time ive ever had security senators dont matter
7925157 the only reason i accepted the nomination so the delaware delegation could be moved up front
7925158 a knowing and willful attempt to violate the strictures of federal election law
7925159 an investigation of the american issues project its officers and directors and its anonymous donors whoever they may be
7925160 this is a sad ploy to circumvent the first amendment by a campaign who has no arguments with the merits of our ad its the classic maneuver if you cant win on the merits file a lawsuit
7925161 ayers tossed bombs a long time ago and who cares what he thinks now

7925169 its critical for brands to reach this market they realize that
7925170 this is something new that kind of already requires awareness because a lot of this is driven through peoples perception of the product
7925171 when youre sharing an affinity for something its kind of hard to grasp exactly what new products encompass without knowing what they already are
7925172 so thinking that theyre going to do engagement ads and that its going to be success alone isnt going to be sufficient
7925173 global warming isnt a pretty suv ad its a frightening reality
7925174 the brands should roll with the negative feedback and listen and incorporate some of that feedback in their upcoming products
7925175 the last thing they should do is shut the ads down
7925176 theres a large amount of social responsibility that comes into play here
7925177 when youre sharing peoples opinions and associating them with certain things it takes a personal attachment that hasnt been used in advertising before
7925178 what they need to do is develop resources for the marketers that will help them be more confident
7925179 maybe the company could develop a marketing conference for marketers on facebook their developer conference in san francisco was huge why arent they doing this for the brands
7925180 facebook is throwing all kinds of pasta at the wall when it comes to marketing and to see what sticks
7925181 they havent figured it out and unfortunately theyre using brands as the guinea pigs and their customers they really have to make it clear to their community what works and what doesnt and develop best practices sooner or later
7925182 dont belong in political office or blacks dont belong in political office he gotta be shot
7925183 federal law enforcement is working hand in glove with the aurora police department because this matter is currently under investigation there is little we can say right now we can say this were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7925184 time is a great teacher but unfortunately it kills all its pupils
7925185 they were playing in the scrimmage and at the end of the play he came up to my son threw him on the ground and grabbed him by the face mask and threatened him
7925186 he said if you ever do that again hell break his neck
7925187 i was very upset first i was shocked because weve been involved in this football program for six years and have never seen anything like this
7925188 the coach like threw me and then he was like took me by the face mask and i was scared so i started crying because like he took me by surprise
7925189 it was very bad it was a poor example and this guy does not need to be coaching he doesnt need to be involved with kids in any way
7925190 we have a real problem when underprivileged citizens are forced to spend nights in homeless shelters or in church but the issue of housing is more than just creating affordable homes for people in our community its also about making sure our neighbors have the opportunity to become financially literate in order to maintain the economic stability necessary to stay in their homes
7925191 thats what organizations like fair tide contribute to our community
7925192 fair tide relies on community support and involvement and in turn provides the community with productive and active citizens thats why this partnership with riverrun is so meaningful
7925193 ho gi finito tutta la nutella non ci tengo a diventare enorme
7925194 estoy cierto de que con nuestra valoraci n jur dica e imparcial honraremos lo que establece la constituci n nica a la que nos debemos
7925195 s respetemos la libertad de la mujer pero reconozcamos que ella no la puede ejercer con violencia por prohibici n del art culo 17 constitucional s respetemos la libertad del concebido lo que no har amos permitiendo que se le privara de la vida seamos garantistas con ambos conforme a nuestra constituci n

7925197 one of the things i know i want to do is write a theme that will permeate throughout the entire work that will somehow be a universal theme how im going to depict that musically im not sure yet
7925198 when we started the glast project we wanted to find ways to communicate not only the science results to a broad audience but also tell the story of how the observatory was built by an extraordinary international team of scientists and engineers
7925199 the prelude effectively communicates the excitement of building and launching the observatory and provides a glimpse of what glast may see in the high energy universe
7925200 the idea is to get people excited about science at a time when there are lots and lots of budget cuts for science and research at a lot of institutions including stanford
7925201 the more the public is interested in science the better it is going to be so much of what we can be grateful for comes out of cutting edge science research
7925202 i found myself really falling in love with science and with the science behind glast in terms of particle physics cosmology and astronomy
7925203 so its been an eye opener for me as well that these two paradigms are so compatible
7925204 the beauty of this satellite in orbit i really wanted to capture that
7925205 the idea is that it will be a little bit of peter and the wolf meets gustav holsts the planets prokofievs peter and the wolf is a story with the depiction of the story in music with the orchestra theres a section of text which is read and music follows that and sonically depicts what is spoken occasionally there is text under the music
7925206 they certainly dont seem to have a lot in common

7925210 but mother wont this be stealing work from the unionized people who have struggled for years to earn the right to carry all packages between various people in the woods

7925212 but mother then shouldnt you have my brother carry the basket since hes an oppressor and should learn what its like to be oppressed
7925213 but wont i be oppressing grandma by implying that shes sick and hence unable to independently further her own selfhood

7925215 you know my dear it isnt safe for a little girl to walk through these woods alone
7925216 i find your sexist remark offensive in the extreme but i will ignore it because of your traditional status as an outcast from society the stress of which has caused you to develop an alternative and yet entirely valid worldview now if youll excuse me i would prefer to be on my way
7925217 grandma i have brought you some cruelty free snacks to salute you in your role of wise and nurturing matriarch
7925218 and grandma what an enormous what a fine nose you have
7925219 naturally i could have had it fixed to help my acting career but i didnt give in to such societal pressures my child
7925220 you must request my permission before proceeding to a new level of intimacy
7925221 if i let you help me now i would be expressing a lack of confidence in my own abilities which would lead to poor self esteem and lower achievement scores on college entrance exams

7925239 lets be clear our troops have completed every mission theyve been given they have created the space for political reconciliation
7925240 by using months old quotes and selective editing the obama ad distorts mccains assessment of the economy
7925241 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
7925242 not one market is showing a positive return over the past 12 months and seven of the metro areas are reporting declines in excess of 20

7925253 i wanted to present an international atmosphere with culture and art not only commercial fashion but also artistic and dramatic and cultural fashion
7925254 i wanted to present a collection for a very futuristic fashion the opening stage stage one was aimed toward an international atmosphere a very creative one for the future for year 2009 for my spring and summer collection
7925255 i wanted to present the beautiful cultural heritage of indonesian and balinese history i wanted to recreate in my designs with the touch of inspiration from bali and so i started with balinese traditional designs
7925256 this weeks fashion week theme is nature i visited here last year as well as about two months ago to collect some traditional paintings from balinese painters and artists so i could recreate the images with digital print in my designs
7925257 when i did designs for traditional balinese designs i found that the motif is very similar to korean and european traditions very international motifs in balinese traditional dress and customs so i do feel great pride for korea and asia and the orient
7925258 i wanted to show the wonderful wonderful heritage of culture and art from asia and the orient to the world
7925259 in the fourth part i wanted to present korean traditional designs from the ancient royal kingdoms of the yi koryo and shilla dynasties
7925260 i love my country the history of culture and its heritage i love asia and the orient i am asian and i am korean so i wanted to recreate our royal kingdom and our traditional customs for an international atmosphere not only for korea but also for the asian heritage
7925261 bali fashion week is very important not only for the fashion industry but after ive seen the problem of the indonesian economy i knew i had to start moving to help revival of this country as well thats why i started the bali fashion week
7925262 bali is an island where every corner is a culture its such a beautiful and marvelous place
7925263 i feel that this place can be the cannes festival of the world but in fashion not because i choose it to be but because the place already supports the cause
7925264 to do a show in an international spot is good for raising ones profile in the international market
7925265 i wished in the future that i could have a fashion show in bali because it is the most beautiful island for many around the world which is also considered the last paradise in the world

7925267 rain signed a contract to perform at the closing ceremony some three months ago when the international olympic committee made an official request but the contract required us to keep it confidential
7925268 i was very moved to see people around the world gather and enjoy this occasion of harmony and festival
7925269 i wondered how china having a more similar sentiment to korea would interpret the movie i was also pleased to know that ning was producing the movie after watching his movie crazy stone i thought he had a unique sense of wit and energy
7925270 i like director bongs movies because they have chase scenes i also know that he pays attention to even the smallest details
7925271 i think horror exists in our everyday lives china does not have many fantasy films because its a socialist state and so the scenario of this will also be as realistic as possible

7925363 its time for journalists to stand together unbowed from attempts by powerful forces to cow us into silence and physical attacks
7925364 we would have wanted to work in silence behind the news but instead many of our colleagues became the news
7925365 nujp will overcome and will continue to establish milestones for the advancement of press freedom
7925366 in the philippines journalists have become an endangered species they should not be blamed for the message they bring but instead be valued for the information they impart to the people
7925367 has become prevalent but we will not retreat to our comfort zones just yet we will become more vigilant in our struggle for press freedom
7925368 press freedom is a struggle that will be carried on by future generations of our profession i dont know why this culture of impunity in our country persists when people in power know very well that we will continue to resist their terror tactics
7925369 i was forced to skip from one job to another because my former bosses wont allow me to attend hearings in our province so to avoid contempt i always had to resign
7925370 journalists are also humans they need to survive too like all of us and yet everyday they are exposed to the dangers of their profession for that they should demand a just and fair compensation and benefits to the owners of their media outfits these should be based on international standards and national laws

7925401 but for developers and you could take someone like quantic dream and heavy rain for example a great game it takes a lot of time to develop they need a little bit of funding external development in exchange its exclusive that works so exclusivity possibly with developers is more likely that exclusivity with publishers

7925436 it has been an excellent first month of operation for the castle course and it has been pleasing to see so many local and visiting golfers enjoying the new addition to golf in st andrews given the changeable weather it is even more remarkable that so many days have been fully booked
7925437 we have received much positive feedback from both local and visiting golfers which suggests that people have welcomed the opportunity to play golf on an exciting new course which offers some stunning vistas of st andrews and out to the north sea
7925438 since the voodoos introduction on tour more and more players are switching to and providing us with amazing feedback

7925440 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7925441 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7925442 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7925443 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7925444 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7925445 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7925446 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7925447 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7925448 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7925449 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7925450 oleme olukorras kus demokraatlikel riikidel lasub vastutus teha iged otsused mis suurendaksid meie k igi turvalisust
7925451 me seisame silmitsi venemaa sellise k itumisega mida tuleb euroopa liidus ja nato s arvestada edasiste valikute tegemisel sest tegemist on organisatsioonidega millede liikmesriike ja partnereid liidavad hised v rtused ja vabaduseideaalid mis on venemaa poolt n d kahtluse alla seatud
7925452 olukorras kus tahetakse lammutada demokraatlikku korda ja euroopalikke v rtusi on esmat htis et euroopa liit ja nato s ilitaksid oma solidaarsuse ja toetuse teistele demokraatlikele riikidele
7925453 olukord gruusias tuleb saada rahvusvahelise kontrolli alla mille v tmes nadeks on rahvusvahelised vaatlejad ja rahuvalve humanitaarabi l bir kimised ning k iges selles on rahvusvahelistel organisatsioonidel oluline roll
7925454 mitme gruusia territoriaalset terviklikkust reguleeriva ro julgeolekun ukogu resolutsiooni otsene rikkumine kusjuures venemaa on ise need resolutsioonid kinnitanud
7925455 nato toetab kindlalt gruusia iseseisvust ja territoriaalselt terviklikkust ning kutsub venemaad neid printsiipe austama
7925456 me oleme kategooriliselt selle vastu ning kinnitame oma toetust gruusia suver nsusele ja territoriaalsele terviklikkusele
7925457 peame seda kahetsusv rseks arenguks ning me kordame oma toetust gruusia territoriaalsele terviklikkusele
7925458 kuna usa on julgeolekun ukogu alaline liige siis on see otsus surnud juba julgeolekun ukogusse saabumise hetkest
7925459 ma arvan et me ei pea kartma isolatsiooni j mist ma ei n e seda tulemas kui k iki pooli juhivad nende rahvuslikud huvid siis pole maailmal pu stsenaariumi karta ning peale j b tavam istus
7925460 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7925461 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7925462 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7925463 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7925464 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7925465 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7925466 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7925467 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7925468 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7925469 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7925470 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7925471 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7925472 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7925473 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7925474 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7925475 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7925476 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7925477 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7925478 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7925479 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7925480 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7925481 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7925482 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7925483 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7925484 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7925485 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7925486 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7925487 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7925488 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7925489 she always explains her presence and never needs to we are the same destroyed cupid slinging bloodied arrows in the anti night
7925490 everything is sleaze here now i was hiding in the bathtub and they still found me and tried to get me up and into their arms
7925491 i didnt move or say anything i dont want their tricky love and garbage not the way you do i thought you were with them but it was just only them then they left out the door where were you they i just wanted them to get out of here how did they know this is where you were staying
7925492 weve been running all night on empty fix us up would you
7925493 why do you think he would go away for half of the year and return with a smile and a tan you know the beach a great place live off the sea pretend to be dead to the rest of the world his family see the magical ladies every gaddamned night
7925494 irresponsible parties to the man never and always two things you can count on in life if nothing else
7925495 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7925496 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7925497 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7925498 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7925499 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7925500 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7925501 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7925502 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7925503 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7925504 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7925505 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7925506 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7925507 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7925508 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7925509 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7925510 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7925511 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7925512 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7925513 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7925514 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7925515 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7925516 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7925517 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7925518 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7925519 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7925520 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7925521 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7925522 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7925523 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7925524 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7925525 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7925526 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7925527 i always look forward to these games and we have a tremendous record against united at fratton park
7925528 last season we did not lose at home to any of the big four
7925529 sure it looks a really big test for us now but i think we are still a very good team at home and we will take some beating united wont relish coming here they never do
7925530 it might work to my advantage that so many players are out of the team
7925531 we have a lot of players out just now and when we are short of numbers you need to take your opportunities
7925532 there is so much quality in the squad we all know if you do not perform the manager will have you straight out of the team
7925533 but as we have seen plenty of times before the manager will stick by you if you do the job he needs
7925534 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7925535 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7925536 they were 12 of the most amazing girls today there are beautiful girls more or less but they dont have that attitude
7925537 its not surprising when you consider where the spending power lies
7925538 when it comes to fashion photography these girls are the best there are its not surprising clients come back to them

7925568 i know they are marketed in saying that they do digest certainly the ones that weve taken out esophageal or intestinal that have been in for days are still very hard
7925569 im mad that their packaging states that the product is 100 percent edible highly digestible and veterinarian approved yet our dog died of it

7925592 quickpwn windows doesnt work well with virtualization as there are some problems with the way usb resets are handled so we wouldnt advise trying it we have had reports of some success with vmware fusion 2 0 beta 2 but this shouldnt be relied on use pwnagetool instead or wait for quickpwn mac

7925601 it was a risky proposition because it could so easily irritate consumers now companies are more willing to experiment with this model to figure out the best ways to intervene either to save a potential sale or make an upsale
7925602 id wanted to stay in the front group because im a good time trialist and had a chance of overall victory but i was too far back when in the peloton when things split it was a crazy mistake

7925609 sadik khan to discuss transpo funding at the democratic convention
7925610 it was a difficult case and a lot of money was required but there was a financial constraint in the family a public appeal was made and sidhu himself donated rs 10 lakh and gave him a new lease of life
7925611 after treating the child for around seven months for jaundice we realised that there is something more to it and then the liver problem was diagnosed following which the appeal was made through media
7925612 we are grateful to the media and all those who donated to save the life of nihal
7925613 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7925614 and through trial and error i finally settled on the type of spit for the task at hand
7925615 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing he found murray mints worked the best
7925616 when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7925617 it is some form of ball tampering it is not about natural deterioration
7925618 i loved the wrist release of flintoff jones and harmison but always felt something was going on as the ball was reversing by the 40th over especially on a grassy pitches
7925619 youre used to seeing the ball reverse early on the much rougher tracks in the subcontinent where the hard surface makes the ball abrasive easily
7925620 to me it is a total hypocrisy on what is deemed to be ball tampering
7925621 there are huge inconsistencies for one side to complain about the other scratching the ball when they are deliberately sucking sugary sweets to shine the ball
7925622 people use suntan oil lip salve scruff the ball with finger and thumbs until they get caught if you apply suntan oil on you forehead or face or arms and rub the sweat on your body which is mixed with suntan oil and then rub the ball what is the difference
7925623 if a batsman edges the ball and stands his ground and no one says a word that is part of the game and if a bowler adds sugary saliva on the ball the spirit of the game is called into question there should be some leniency about what the bowler can do to the ball you dont want a cricket ball tested at the end of day for sugar for sun cream for lip gel for finger nails and whatever else you want to try and put on it
7925624 i actually wish marcus put a bit more mint on the ball so it deflected further off my glove
7925625 were talking about sugar coating using mints there are a lot more major issues in the game at the moment to worry about
7925626 i had no knowledge of it and i certainly wouldnt recommend anything like that
7925627 i dont know if it would even work i would never cheat in the game bowlers have used sweat and polish over the years to shine the ball there is an old wives tale from past years that sunscreen and brylcreem helps the ball swing but i dont know about that
7925628 may polish the ball provided that no artificial substance is used
7925629 it depends on the evidence and circumstances so if something is brought to our attention it would be dealt with
7925630 over the last century or so bowlers have been fiddling around with balls using all sorts of stuff
7925631 if hes come out and said that hes used it yes its unethical
7925632 yes he got away with it good luck to him you cant change the result of the test series
7925633 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on the best type of spit for the task at hand it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing as with most of the great scientific discoveries this one happened quite by accident while at warwickshire dermot reeve noticed that his bowlers somehow had the ability to keep the ball swinging far longer than any team they faced the problem was no one knew why he realised the player in charge of polishing and keeping the ball clean was his top order batsman asif din and what he did to keep his concentration levels up was chewing extra strong mints it took a while for word to get around the circuit but once it did the sales of sweets near the county grounds of england went through the roof i tried asif s confection of choice but couldn t get on with them too dry so i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat trouble was even allowing for trying to keep one going as long as possible i still used to get through about 15 a day and the taste soon palled once phil neale came on board as our operations manager it was one of his jobs to make sure the dressing room was fully stocked at all times we even tried taking them on tour a couple of times until we realised that they didn t work as well on the kookaburra balls used overseas as the dukes we used back home

7925655 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
7925656 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
7925657 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
7925658 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
7925659 it is as if sportsmen and women have a higher base level of sexual energy but why can it be that one of the underlying drivers of sporting greatness is also the very thing that produces an overactive sex drive
7925660 all the swimmers are talking about it and sullivan is cut up about what happened
7925661 i definitely admire him for his athletic ability and everything hes achieved
7925662 im just really glad to be in the mix with that
7925663 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
7925664 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
7925665 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
7925666 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
7925667 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
7925668 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in
7925669 eww thats nasty i have never ever hooked up with michael phelps
7925670 come on i have really good taste hes really not my type we dont even talk to each other
7925671 im not dating amanda beard i think she has a boyfriend
7925672 part of my life is kept to myself im able to relax and be with my friends those pretty much are the only people who really know the answer to that
7925673 its just experience shes been in the olympics before shes been in world championships shes jumped a decade longer than me so its just a matter of time
7925674 i just wanted to prove who is the best at the olympic games
7925675 may i please get ahead of you in this line i have to catch a plane back to america and in a great hurry to get to the airport

7925691 stress the traditional family values and economic values that pennsylvanians care about
7925692 the senators weakness is hes been too loyal to george bush
7925693 there are plenty of good democrats who could make good candidates and fine senators
7925694 i did that and was greatly outspent by the senator you need to speak with a bold vision
7925695 its going to be a hard act to follow the important thing is he has the intellectual ability to learn
7925696 hes so nice to people but when its time to fight for the things he beleives in theres no stoppping him you are so lucky to have sen casey

7925703 africa is in desperate need of qualified and talented management to help its economies not only running companies but helping entrepreneurs and ensuring more effective corporate and legislative governance policy
7925704 microfinance used to be seen as charming methodology that worked an endearing niche of the development world with enterprising women hard at work with sewing machines or fruit stands but ministers of finance around the world are starting to understand that access to finance for the poor is much more than that
7925705 its about building efficient and equitable financial systems that serve the majority of the population the electorate in their countries
7925706 the two worlds of profit and development are now starting to collide in microfinance creating both conflict and opportunities
7925707 a very strong ongoing role for both ifc and cgap in navigating these conflicts

7925743 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals

7925925 montana students rank 1 when compared to other states with an equal or higher number of test takers
7925926 these impressive results show montana schools are improving despite this years ayp report which is required under the federal no child left behind act
7925927 montana students continue to raise the bar for subsequent graduating classes the 2008 high school graduates scored 3 points higher in reading and 5 points higher in math than the 2007 graduating class
7925928 im proud to report that 28 of those students plan on becoming first generation college graduates
7925929 the 2008 sat results both in montana and nationally indicate that a gender gap still persists in math performance scores while montana boys and girls had similar scores in reading the boys scored an average of 33 points higher on the math portion than the girls
7925930 an interesting aspect of the sat test results is how well our public school students performed those montana seniors attending public schools scored 552 in math compared to the montana state average of 548 those same students scored 544 in reading compared to the state average of 541
7925931 montana seniors attending public schools also scored an average 3 points higher in writing than seniors attending non public schools
7925932 our students have become increasingly aware of the importance of higher edcation and college preparatory courses

7925940 hey who wants to try some carbonated yogurt in a tube it comes in extreme flavors
7925941 consume within 7 days of sell by date even if frozen
7925942 kids under 5 years may have difficulty swallowing frozen fizzix lowfat yogurt snack please be sure to thaw before serving
7925943 its like a melted popsicle with pop rocks embedded in it
7925944 its like the yogurt equivalent of the kfc bowl for lazy people
7925945 goes down like slightly fizzy yogurt but the burps have a soda kinda feel to them its odd to have that slight carbonation burn from something creamy
7925946 this is pretty good way better than i expected but if you dump 10 grams of sugar and carbonation in anything itll probably be palatable
7925947 i shouldve stopped at the triple berry this tastes more like generic yogurt the fizziness is definitely less pronounced than the triple berry
7925948 i think im going to regret having two of these in a row in such a short period of time in fact i already am
7925949 the carbonation isnt really that noticeable and its hardly extreme i dont even know if id notice it if wasnt marketed as such
7925950 the label frightened me a bit what with all the exploding intestines displayed on it the actual blue raspberry flavor was tolerable as an exit flavor but the bitter fizzy foretaste was merely off putting overall i am leery about the combination of dairy and pop rocks probably for good reason
7925951 sweet for yogurt somewhere between kool aid fruit punch and a popsicle kids like food that reminds them of other food
7925952 very small bubbles on the tongue are unusual at first but makes me want to try more its strange to discover carbonation in a viscous goo kind of how i imagine edge shaving gel works
7925953 the slight sourness of the milk cultures and the carbonation left a beer aftertaste for me

7926113 i suppose it will be debunked last night i am in st luis yet he was in kansas city mo
7926114 it always makes me laugh when people say is she isnt she its like eventually you will know so just chill out for a minute
7926115 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
7926116 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
7926117 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
7926118 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
7926119 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
7926120 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
7926121 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
7926122 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
7926123 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
7926124 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
7926125 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
7926126 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
7926127 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
7926128 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
7926129 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
7926130 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
7926131 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
7926132 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
7926133 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
7926134 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
7926135 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
7926136 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
7926137 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
7926138 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
7926139 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
7926140 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
7926141 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
7926142 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
7926143 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
7926144 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
7926145 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
7926146 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
7926147 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
7926148 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
7926149 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
7926150 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
7926151 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
7926152 and shes not even mad at her parents for not telling her what happened to jim
7926153 they havent told her yet they just said he couldnt come that could mean anything
7926154 ive had a sneaking suspicion about a double wedding for some time now i was afraid to mention it because it might come true if i did
7926155 this is the point where a real woman would burst into shocked angry tears maybe even consider the entire day ruined and never entirely get over it
7926156 but honey you just got married do you have to go now
7926157 what i cant understand is elly jims own daughter asking
7926158 why isnt elly figuring out a way she can get over to the hospital to see jim if only for half an hour or so before reappearing at the reception
7926159 think liz will take april with her to the hospital yeah me neither
7926160 liz anthony john elly dee and mike will go leaving the kids to be watched by guess who
7926161 i predict neither liz nor anthony will give ellys behaviour a passing thought its all about getting grandpa to see the dress by whatever means i further predict that liz and anthony will stop at the hospital reception desk and anthony the man i specify that because it is hard to know with him and therefore the one in charge will tell the receptionist that mr amp mrs anthony caine are here to see jim richards and liz will simper and beam and thought bubble her joy at her new name
7926162 honestly im as pissed at foobs turn as anyone else but when you take time to learn her history you can see why people are portrayed a certain way the sad thing is that foob was such an awesome strip before she decided to forego any therapy sessions in favor of puking her emo kittens on paper
7926163 is it me or does foob read like the worst fanfic version of itself
7926164 ellys response is interesting and shows her in a much worse light than her daughter this rarely happens in this strip anymore so it is nice to see someone look better than elly for a change
7926165 you can guarantee that if it were one of my grandparents in the hospital on my wedding day neither one of my parents would act like the reception is more important than visiting said ailing grandparent
7926166 for better or for worse with the implicit knowledge that liz is staying up north and willing to be a small town school teacher married to a policeman instead we have the milborough wife this sucks it just straight out sucks and i have so little energy to invest in grandpa jims last words owisdom that i suck hell i havent contributed here in months im so blase but seriously i grew up on this strip and loved it and identified with lizs meeting older men at the beach mikes first attempts at writing entering college partying blah blah blah that it really got me to see when the charachters no longer seemed real im sad you invest 24 years in something you dont want to be mad at its ending and yet thats where i am maybe if it ended at mikes wedding we wouldnt be so mad now just saying
7926167 why do you need to go to see grampa liz hes already seen the dress
7926168 theyre not here to behold me in all my bridezillaness how dare they this better be good
7926169 but you just got married do you have to go to the hospital now
7926170 ive been planning your teal and lavender barbie dream wedding to this limp fish for years missy dont you dare ruin my day
7926171 it is now time for me to show what a caring person i am by rushing to my dying grandfathers side even though i see him maybe once every six months and gave away his heirloom harmonica and anyway im mrs caine now so my lifes mission has been fulfilled
7926172 with all of ellys constant neck craning and checking on this married couple yesterday todays
7926173 well i give liz credit for catching on to the fact that jims missing and wanting to go to the hospital
7926174 lets go to the hospital before we go to the reception so at least he can see you in your dress and we know hes okay
7926175 elly though my god if their friends and family are the kind thoughtful people lynn would like us to believe they are they would understand why liz has ducked out of the reception they would offer to drive her to the hospital for that matter but elly just wants to see liz showing off before all of milboring and how can that happen if princess is visiting jim jim oh yes jim hes ellys father one of the people without whom she wouldnt exist hes in his eighties hes had two strokes and hes just had a heart attack but its nothing serious folks hes in the hospital so you know he wont die there nobody ever does i really cant believe that kind of reaction to his health ellys supposed to be the dutiful daughter and its obvious she doesnt give a shit if jim dies or lives another twenty years
7926176 i really have to wonder at the mental health of people who spend their requisite 30 seconds reading a comic strip then burst into tears every morning for two freaking weeks
7926177 anything to put off that honeymoon for another couple hours eh liz
7926178 is lynn johnston just trying to see how far she can go with portraying elly as the most cold blooded insensitive buttnoodle in the world
7926179 you are your truth not i i am not of you but you of i
7926180 i sat down with them at practice yesterday and they seemed fine

7926198 as you can see the other two ran when i confronted them
7926199 i thought id gotten my violent side under control many many years ago when i got into buddhism so im very disappointed in myself for simply not running
7926200 it seems my youth caught up with me and i lost control which is very disappointing as i really thought id beaten this violent side of my past

7926204 clearly i want to win all the time but ive learned that sometimes its more advantageous to score as many points as possible and live to fight another day
7926205 my aim is still to win the world championship and you dont do that by ending up in the barriers after making an opportunistic move
7926206 in valencia we scored a very useful haul of points and ive actually come away from the weekend having extended my lead in the championship despite losing two points to felipe

7926274 the fourth defensive tackle is a guy by the name of klecko
7926275 he looks good to me right now he had a good game the other night and hes had a great camp
7926276 ive been hearing that hes a long shot since ive been in the nfl
7926277 they said i was too small to be a nose tackle up in new england
7926278 i just put it out of my mind and go play
7926279 he has good football sense and he loves to play hes a high motor guy im not going to say he hasnt surprised me some im not quite as surprised after being around him a bit
7926280 honestly if you guys had not just told me id have no idea what was said
7926281 ive got to get through this week and then hopefully when the roster for st louis the season opener comes youre name is still there im just going to keep doing what i did to get here keep pushing
7926282 to tell truth id only lost about 10 pounds to go down to fullback
7926283 putting the weight back on wasnt the problem it was eating all that chicken and salad to get it off in the first place
7926284 switching back to tackle was easy you just go back to what you know the only thing was you had to get back in that pass rushing and run stuffing mind set it wasnt a big deal
7926285 i had to learn the whole front seven in new england
7926286 it was just as complicated up there dont get me wrong because im still learning but i think its going ok
7926287 this is a sensitive time and we need to make sure we reach a solution one way or another
7926288 everything is going well and a deal can be reached the differences we have are ones we can solve and in the next two or three days there has to be a solution because there is no more time
7926289 there is a team which is offering what we have asked and another one which isnt but the player is interested in the one which is offering the least
7926290 i am not even considering the option of liverpool not qualifying for the group stages i am just thinking about winning my concern now is to improve how we play we can play better liege were good in the first leg but we were really poor
7926291 at anfield we are confident we can win and i expect us to win
7926292 but yes i am aware of the financial implications of liverpool not qualifying money is really important but that is always the situation in football the key is to do the right things have confidence and then we will not be thinking about such things as not qualifying i am confident that will not be the case

7926347 the opium flood waters in afghanistan have started to recede
7926348 this year the historic high water mark of 193 000 hectares of opium cultivated in 2007 has dropped by 19 percent to 157 000 hectares
7926349 the drug threat in afghanistan remains unacceptably high we are particularly concerned by the deterioration in security conditions in the south where the insurgency dominates
7926350 the most glaring example is hilmand province where 103 00 hectares of opium were cultivated this year two thirds of all opium in afghanistan
7926351 if hilmand were a country it would once again be the worlds biggest producer of illicit drugs
7926352 were not satisfied and we will never be satisfied until we really start squeezing poppy cultivation out of the hilmand economy
7926353 if we won 25 000 id get a contract killer and send him after jim davidson

7926360 the opium flood waters in afghanistan have started to recede

7926362 the drug threat in afghanistan remains unacceptably high we are particularly concerned by the deterioration in security conditions in the south where the insurgency dominates
7926363 the most glaring example is hilmand province where 103 00 hectares of opium were cultivated this year two thirds of all opium in afghanistan

7926368 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7926369 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7926370 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7926380 the idea for newscred originated during many late night coffee fueled debates over the future of newspapers and traditional media between my cofounder iraj and myself it was the summer of 2007 and we spent a lot of time in cafes and bars on the banks of lake geneva brainstorming our crazy ideas it was clear to us that the media industry was broken and it seemed like the entire news space was one of the few traditions that wasnt yet disrupted by the latest web technologies on top of that every single person we spoke to told us that they were getting fed up of news that was biased or inaccurate or just not transparent it seemed like a big enough problem to tackle so we decided to give it a go
7926381 we are a truly distributed international company it sounds cool but there are a lot of challenges involved iraj is based out of stockholm im in geneva and we have developers in bangladesh having offshore developers is always going to a be a challenge for many well documented reasons communication time difference etc but we were able to get around a lot of those because iraj actually moved to bangladesh for a while and camped out with our dev team to train them motivate them and ensure the communication was always flowing i dont think it would have been possible to build a company like this a few years back but thanks to skype google docs and some crazy working hours we were able to pull it off i certainly wouldnt discourage distributed startups it just requires discipline and lots of red bull to counter the effects of time difference
7926382 geneva has a small but passionate entrepreneurial culture we got lucky in a big way index ventures is located in geneva and they host their weekly opencoffee events here i was able to meet a lot of the index guys informally and the relationships and feedback from that have been great but lets not kid ourselves geneva is not the next silicon valley by any means but it does have other advantages a great quality of life its beautiful people are relaxed and theres lots of time for snowboarding in the winter iraj lives in sweden which proudly exports some great entrepreneurial names such as zennstrom and friis while the startup ecosystem in stockholm is much more mature its still not the same as the valley the biggest disadvantage of living outside the valley is that its hard to do the real life networking via meetups dinners conferences and parties that happen daily in the valley i find it strange that a lot of people think you cant build a startup outside the valley or that its hard to get on the map thats bullshit skype last fm and countless other ventures prove it in terms of getting on that map you just have to be creative and persevere we were covered on all the big valley blogs like techcrunch rww etc at the end of the day that feels great but it isnt going to be the lasting source of traffic you have to build a product people want and to do that you dont need to be in silicon valley
7926383 with all the news sources mashups blogs and aggregators available today it is becoming increasingly difficult to discriminate between real vetted news and biased unfactual or untenable news if the current web is all about getting information into the hands of the consumer the next web will be about extracting signal from all that noise newscred is giving news readers a platform to voice their opinion about the quality of news and the people producing the news and thats what the next web is all about for us quality not popularity as social news sites mature a move towards quality is inevitable one of our fundamental beliefs is that being a news reader is qualification enough to determine quality and were finally putting the power back into the hands of the consumer the media industry today is broken the next web will be about bringing together news readers and journalists and giving them a platform to really improve the entire life cycle of news we want to improve how we report the news how we consume it and how we evaluate it we call this the social media revolution after all access to credible and quality news is a cornerstone of democracy
7926384 over the next several months well be adding blogs from the mid and long tail within those verticals

7926454 this report adds weight to the view that the government massively overestimated the number of people who need help making the transition to digital
7926455 progress has been made but it will come as little comfort to the hundreds of bbc employees who lost their jobs following the governments tight licence fee settlement
7926456 many of us were concerned at the use of the licence fee to fund this scheme in the first place now we need to know what will happen to the millions of pounds of licence fee payers money that could be left over at the end of this
7926457 the dcms and the bbc will keep the level of funding under review during the lifetime of the scheme
7926458 either invest the leftover money back into public sector broadcasting or return it to the licence fee payer
7926459 worrying that there is so much to be done before everyone is ready for switchover
7926460 its time the government got to the bottom of why they have failed to get the message out there both on switchover in general and the assistance scheme in particular
7926461 we also need know what they will do if there is a significant underspend on the assistance scheme this is public money and they need to say where it will be spent if its not needed for its original purpose
7926462 this is a response to a slower traffic period and were giving ourselves some operational flexibility in the winter months

7926476 new zealand kids deserve the best education not the bare minimum and certainly not via a mechanism that has been shown to fail education objectives
7926477 national testing directs teachers to teaching the bare minimum of the test rather than for the best learning outcomes for each child it is an unnecessary distraction and sucks time and resources out of schools for no purpose
7926478 there are already enough good assessment tools which schools use successfully the key issue for schools is a lack of resources national has no plans to increase the operations grant for schools nor to relieve them of some inherent funding anomalies such as having to pay support staff from the same funding pool used for equipment and administration
7926479 the thing i got to say to you all its a corny sounding thing i dont know whether i would have made it through a lot of the tough times in my life without you guys i mean it sincerely im not gonna start naming people but thereve been people in this room who when the significant events of my life occurred were literally knocking on my door were bringing you know you know you know a roasted chicken to the house because you knew things were so messed up no one was able to think about eating

7926485 as the market continues to move from single sourced tightly coupled vertically integrated middleware to multi sourced loosely coupled vertically aware applications and stacks developers need a simple self service method for deploying their applications to clouds and virtual servers

7926500 we are considering whether it is appropriate to similarly adopt 14 day transition periods at other transmission sites and whether in some regions with high dtt digital terrestrial television coverage a single switchover might be possible
7926501 the report highlights evidence of confusion by consumers over who would receive free help or how someone would benefit from paying the 40 fee for support
7926502 this confusion probably contributed to fewer older people having the help that would benefit them lessons must be learned here to ensure that all vulnerable older people receive the help they need

7926523 our findings suggest that the fungi can capture the energy from radiation and transform it into other forms of energy that can be used for growth
7926524 the presence of melanin in the cells gives them a distinct advantage over non melanised cells in terms of better growth with radiation
7926525 that melanin transformed part of the ionising radiation energy into the energy of electrons which represents the chemical form of energy that fungi could potentially use in their metabolism
7926526 from the otherwise unexplained superior growth of the melanised organisms
7926527 much more work will be required before a convincing case for the cellular use of this energy can be presented

7926623 i walked away and said good night and walked over across the hall to the elevators
7926624 and i came back over and said excuse me what did you just say and he grabbed me by my arms and started laughing and i said no no what did you just say and he didnt repeat it and i said did you call me an uncle tom and then i came back with a barrage of things that i wont repeat publicly
7926625 what i said was come on board hes a nice clean cut guy and everything i said weve got to stop all this weve got too many

7926627 people often pray for health peace for themselves and some for fortune but all are selfish deeds if fortune is granted they will praise the above but if fortune is not granted or gone instead they will curse the above if one is destined to get he will get it if fate is against him no matter how much he prays he will not get it if things are not his even if they enter the pocket he will still find a hole in it and lose it man oh man why die for fortune seek it with a righteous heart and work hard for its return fortune that you get from no work it will not stay long ask not the unnecessary but work only for what may be yours man on this plane will die for three things fame wealth and lust he will fight all his life and for it he will die for fame and wealth brotherhood is lost they fight for fortune and they fight for fame doesnt the young know that there is nothing thicker than blood from the same genes and blood one is produced yet with the same blood one fights for gains being in poverty the only thing man thinks about is how to achieve wealth for men who already have fame and wealth their burden is much heavier way up high in the ladder the pride of achievement is equally high thus to protect from falling they will not only have to work hard but must know when to move forward and when to remain being high up above all in achievement they have posted themselves to unseen danger with fame and wealth lust is the next evil that may begin its action to tempt and emotion will step in for human being a man of emotion emotion will be his downfall if not controlled in time only by controlling ones emotion things maybe clear but if blinded with emotions lower and lower one would descend

7926640 and the are an arrogant people now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that i may destroy them but moses sought the favor of the lord his god
7926641 i will destroy the wisdom of the wise the intelligence of the intelligent i will frustrate
7926642 words of human wisdom is literally wisdom of speech in the greek pauls mission was not to couch the gospel in the language of the trained orator who had studied the techniques of influencing people by persuasive arguments
7926643 among corinthian believers is the very antithesis of the wisdom of god revealed in the cross of christ paul demonstrates the total alienation of thought between the worldly vision so prized by the corinthians and the wisdom of god
7926644 from this new cross has sprung a new philosophy of the christian life and from that new philosophy has come a new evangelical technique a new type of meeting and a new type of preaching
7926645 if i were god and i am loving and merciful i would simply make a decree that man is absolved of his sins
7926646 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways
7926647 as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts

7926652 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross daily
7926653 no one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of god
7926654 yeah that person used to say he was a christian but just look at him now
7926655 from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing and forceful men lay hold of it
7926656 they enter the kingdom and become christs disciples to do this takes spiritual courage vigor power and determination because of ever present persecution
7926657 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god to salvation for everyone who believes for the jew first and also for the greek
7926658 for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing
7926659 for jews request a sign and greeks seek after wisdom but we preach christ crucified to the jews a stumbling block and to the greeks foolishness vv 22 23
7926660 thats the sign thats the proof that this is the messiah at last
7926661 we dont need some old outdated book like the bible we need some kind of new revelation some sort of deeply spiritual experience
7926662 so you are now new and improved postmodern man why then do you simply repeat the same foolish mistakes of the past
7926663 didnt shy away from the hard truth of the cross but embraced it instead saying in effect im not looking for a popular position from which to proclaim this message or advance it on the back of public favor

7926739 plus all those people took the time to pray for me
7926740 i have never been to the south how about savannah and hilton head
7926741 you have to be cruel to be kind as a young and aspiring singer and composer in the 1980s and 1990s my mentors were no different
7926742 they used to shout at me if my work was not good and that was why i worked hard to improve my skills and make it in the music industry
7926743 he said i was not fit to sit in his place this really hurt my feelings but i subsequently strived extra hard to show him i could do it seven years down the road i finally pleased him
7926744 he was the real sir alex he yelled abuses at me if i did not perform well as a singer and im always grateful to him for pushing my limits
7926745 i believe in being brutal and honest ticking them off for lousy performances and making sure they work hard every day for their weekly concerts
7926746 at times i even make them sing while carrying chairs they may feel the pain of such harsh discipline but at the end of the day they thank me for it
7926747 if one is to be a successful entertainer he or she has to train under harsh discipline only then can a star be born
7926748 you have to give them credit where credit is due too all good mentors including the terrors who coached me did the same
7926749 my maternal great grandfather was a back up singer for the legendary r azmi i guess i inherited his talent
7926750 i damaged the cornea of my right eye in the car crash and stayed in hospital for a month after that i decided to concentrate on composing and songwriting though i occasionally sing with other artistes
7926751 i also composed songs for saiful apek as a soloist after he left the troupe
7926752 the show which lasted two seasons was a very good initiative by tv3 sadly there were not many established artistes who were willing to participate as mentors due to their busy schedules
7926753 nevertheless there came gang starz and its a far better programme because it unites young and talented new singers in all of aseans original member countries

7926784 separation of sense and state a clarification for the people of the church in northern colorado
7926785 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7926786 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude
7926787 whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7926788 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7926789 holy crap the leaves are beginning to change colors already

7926792 for the first time a film was made not on the heroism of the hero but that of life amid the hardest of situations
7926793 the film as the name suggests talks about the rhythm of life that turns victorious even in face of poverty misery and death perhaps this is the reason the film has been able to stand the test of time
7926794 my father pawned my mother bijoyas jewellery to finance the first stage of shooting of pather panchali the shooting was on the verge of suspension when then west bengal chief minister bidhanchandra ray came forward and ultimately financed it
7926795 throughout the making of the film my father was worried over two major things that chunibala devi who was in her nineties and played the old aunt indir thakrun in the film didnt die before completion of the film and the boy subir banerjee who played apu didnt physically grow up
7926796 but very few know that my father projected his own image and psychology in the character of apu

7926800 i know senator mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and senator obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7926801 now these next three days i think youre going to see an intensity of attack
7926802 but you know you dont want to get negative choppy every single day and i think what were seeing today here is a democratic party thats positive thats unified that wants to heal that wants to bring bipartisanship and you know ill talk about that too
7926803 if the republicans are good at anything they are experts at fear and smear divide and conquer
7926804 what we have to do though i think is rebut those charges but also to point out the real mccain record
7926805 understands a lot more about how people have to struggle economically than john mccain will ever in his whole lifetime
7926806 i ask basic questions what are you going to do in the shoe
7926807 we can check the wear patterns to see if that shoe is correct for you
7926808 some people want one shoe for everything and thats just not possible today
7926809 dont wear a running shoe for volleyball running is a straight forward activity volleyball is back and forth running shoes dont have any lateral support so youll roll an ankle
7926810 that helps transition as you pull your toe up and makes the transition smoother since you dont leave the ground
7926811 a true crosstrainer used to be something cut a little higher
7926812 the big thing these days is how the midsole is set up if you have an unstable midsole youre going to roll your ankle
7926813 we developed footwear in concert with sparq to support that kind of training activity and launched in march and april
7926814 that is the shoe that can stand up to different activities

7926850 even with the 64 bit power mac g5 hardware there were still software limitations in 2003s mac os x panther the 32 bit os allowed the system to support more than 4gb of memory but still corralled each application into its own 32 bit 4gb space with 2005s mac os x tiger apple enabled desktop apps to spin off processes and servers that could handle enormous memory addressing of their own up to a theoretical 16 eb of 64 bit virtual memory and a conceptual 42 bits or 4tb of physical ram although shipping macs still could only support 8gb of ram
7926851 to enable this tiger supplied a 64 bit version of libsystem the system library handling most of its unix apis this followed the lp64 model to allow broad compatibility with 64 bit versions of linux and commercial unix it also delivered a 64 bit powerpc abi application binary interface for accommodating native 64 bit apps on the g5 tiger still used a 32 bit kernel although it was not limited to 32 bit memory addressing so it could actually make use of the 8gb of ram installed in g5s and it was also still missing a 64 bit version of the cocoa or carbon apis which meant apps with a user interface had to be 32 bit
7926852 however a 32 bit graphical app on tiger could spin off a faceless 64 bit background process to perform number crunching on a vast data set requiring a 64 bit memory space which could then communicate the results back to the 32 bit foreground app running in parallel apple also delivered a mechanism for deploying applications using a bundle of both 64 bit and 32 bit code allowing the system to automatically run the appropriate version for the mac hardware in use tiger itself also supplied both 32 and 64 bit underpinnings allowing one os to run on any mac
7926853 this has made it easier for apple to rapidly migrate mac users toward 64 bit hardware
7926854 when apple began migrating to intel in 2006 it actually had to take a step backward as it only initially supported 32 bit intel systems with the core solo and core duo cpus apple had to cope with the same 32 bit pc limitations microsoft had been dealing with in the intel transition mac developers lost the features supplied by powerpc including its liberal supply of registers however intels new 32 bit core duo was fast enough in other areas to skirt around the problem particularly in laptops where the aging g4 was holding macs back
7926855 by the end of the year apple had widened support to include the 64 bit x64 pc architecture in the new mac pro and xserve and subsequent desktop macs using the core 2 duo also delivered 64 bit hardware support with updates to tiger apple delivered the same level of 64 bit support for x64 intel processors as it had for the powerpc g5
7926856 within the course of one year apple had not only adroitly moved its entire mac product line to intel but also paved the way forward to rapidly push its users to 64 bits narrowly escaping the disaster of being left the last member of the desktop powerpc party in its spare time the company also threw the iphone together while also working to develop its next jump in 64 bit operating system software
7926857 in contrast a separate 64 bit version of windows is required to run 64 bit windows apps on 64 bit x86 pcs and any 32 bit apps have to run in a special compatibility environment below
7926858 software compatibility a lack of drivers and other problems have also complicated the move to 64 bit windows leaving mainstream windows users stuck at 32 bits windows 7 was initially supposed to move users to 64 bits in perhaps 2010 but reports indicate that it too will be delivered in separate 32 and 64 bit versions
7926859 the trouble is im a college student and not an affluent one and i simply do not have the time energy or resources to fight this battle right now theres a point at which i am willing to give up and be practical to let the world have its way with that ever mistreated little ideal of principle thus its with great sadness that i must announce that ill be pulling tris from the app store on wednesday august 27th to remain in apples systems but publicly unavailable until i work out a solution to this
7926860 a few last words on the subject then i dont believe the tetris company consider themselves to be acting in bad faith the lack of protection for the idea of a game is troubling in that it promotes quick ripoffs of a concept that someone somewhere spent a lot of effort on the tetris company are protecting their own interest without a name that meant something to license they would have as i understand it no significant assets at all
7926861 that said the approach theyre taking seems to me little more than petty bullying
7926862 to clarify if apple had not told me theyd take action of their own if i didnt resolve the dispute tris would be staying up i dont think this will be permanent when i have the time and can find a good copyright lawyer ill be figuring out exactly what my position is and how i can make tris available again

7926961 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
7926962 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7926963 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7926964 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended to create a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7926965 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
7926966 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7926967 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
7926968 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
7926969 as an ardent practicing catholic abortion is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7926970 since it must be treated from conception as a person the embryo must be defended in its integrity cared for and healed as far as possible like any other human being
7926971 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
7926972 the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

7927031 with sketchup we dreamed of a simple tool that would give people the ability to think fast and iterate often on complex building design problems with this release ies is plugging a set of energy analysis tools into sketchup at just the right level of complexity enabling designers to think not just about how a building might look but also how it will perform in a sustainable world
7927032 im incredibly excited by todays launch in many ways its a culmination of 14 years of work when i founded ies in 1994 my aim was to develop what were primarily academic tools and bring them into mainstream use by linking our tools directly to google sketchup and continuing to develop different levels of interface we are making the sustainable design potential of performance analysis very easily available to a huge number of professionals
7927033 we are very excited about the possibilities the ies sketchup plug in presents plans to extend this capability into the hands of more of our staff are already underway our energy analysis team is doing an exceptional job of documenting the work flow so that we will easily be able to engage others once the product is officially launched this connectivity allows many more of our architectural staff to take advantage of iess environmental analysis capabilities to better assure that our designs are being formed for optimal performance in early design
7927034 this new tool means we now have the ability to integrate building performance analysis from early conceptual design using sketchup through our entire design process using revit architecture faster feedback in design affords more opportunity to innovate with sustainability in mind this means not only can we make the right decisions in the first place we can make the right decision at every step in the process

7927199 energy markets have not yet focused on what this latest escalation could mean for a potential disruption in energy supplies
7927200 until we get better clarity on this latter issue we expect the price reverberations from this situation to be relatively contained
7927201 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
7927202 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us
7927203 traditionally the culture sector has been recognized for its multi faceted role in contributing to individual and community development social cohesion and quality of life
7927204 however in recent decades there has been growing understanding and examination of the substantial economic contribution of arts and cultural industries and of their central role in the creative economy

7927209 gustav continues to represent a potential threat to oil and gas installations in the gulf region and will be watched with vigilance
7927210 given the current track for gustav and the expectation that it might enter the gulf of mexico this weekend we are making logistical arrangements to evacuate staff who are not essential to production or drilling operations
7927211 evacuations could begin as early as wednesday there is no impact on production at this time
7927212 the dollar index has shown that it can at time override the oil fundamentals and will probably dominate until gustav defines a more definitive path
7927213 but the market is reacting to it and edging up
7927214 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7927215 i was angry to be in that situation and recognised him from last year when he tried the same trick
7927216 he said he wanted to buy tickets for his cousin so i blocked his way but he pushed me and hid the notes in his shirt
7927217 it was just my instinct because this was money belonging to the queens hall
7927218 ive worked for the hall for 29 years and i love it and would have hated to see it robbed
7927219 i was very surprised to see the same thief again but my job is to be responsible for that money so i tried to get it back
7927220 vera is well known and loved in edinburghs theatres and we have no qualms employing someone of her age
7927221 the concert was part of the edinburgh international festival and we think the robber was waiting outside for a quiet moment to pounce
7927222 but vera has a great love for the theatre and stuck up for herself to the best of her abilities as well as give a good description to police which we really do thank her for
7927223 this woman has acted very bravely in trying to stop the thief getting away with any money
7927224 although she was not hurt the ordeal has left her understandably shaken
7927225 if they are there then that is what the plan would be

7927228 we can already see the underlying weakness that will undo alex salmond
7927229 what looks confident sure footed and wily today will be seen as arrogant misguided and politically dishonest tomorrow

7927256 barbara opel nagged me to find someone to kill her boss
7927257 thats all she talked about hiring people to kill jerry heimann at first i refused but changed my mind when she promised to buy me a car and give my friends some cash she said if we got rid of jerry heimann we could get our hands on 40 000 he had in his bank account
7927258 mom says that if i help kill jerry i can have one
7927259 heimann was not only beaten with baseball bats and fists
7927260 this wasnt the first plot barbara opel hatched to kill her boss
7927261 it was just the first one that resulted in one death and several destroyed lives not the least of which is that of her own daughter the gifted and talented heather opel
7927262 the level of violent screaming is escalating and recently one of the neighbors has heard slaps to the baby
7927263 the mother has been yelling at heather since the child was 3 months old
7927264 heathers environment was non stop violence both in language and behavior
7927265 that little girl has been in counseling on and off since she was five or six years old
7927266 she caught him and hit him and dragged him by the hair it was reported that derek was yelling dont hit me mommy
7927267 an active battle ground and barbara opels subsequent relationship was yet another minefield
7927268 but her mom always had like this big control over her i mean youre supposed to do what your mom says but when your mom tells you to murder somebody maybe its time to not be so obedient you know
7927269 if her mom says do it heather does it heather does not question mom
7927270 heather was the only girl on the boys team and she was the best player by far the only problem was that the mom would yell and scream at her and heather would start crying
7927271 that i made her one of my assistant coaches so i could control her from the dugout
7927272 she was a lady i would never forget in my entire life
7927273 i was dismayed when the woman moved into her neighborhood she was just so mean
7927274 screaming at her kids all the time all hours of the night you would never hear her lovingly talking to her children
7927275 opels kids were often locked out of the house so i would let them help me do yard work she just didnt want them in the house i guess
7927276 you feel compassion for children who you dont think are getting the love and attention they need
7927277 in the seven years ive gone without seeing my 13 year old daughter and 11 year old son ive never stopped thinking about them
7927278 i stopped trying and moved to wenatchee with my current wife and children
7927279 ive just been writing my child support checks and hoping they go to a good cause i guess they didnt

7927290 after i went to the front door to see if anybody would answer and nobody answered

7927292 they told me that there wouldnt be a police officer dispatched because they cant force their way into someones home simply because of a phone call i decided to come back the next day

7927671 indien grootsheid van doel kleinheid van middelen en verbazingwekkende resultaten de drie criteria zijn van een menselijke genie wie zou dan durven om welke grote man dan ook in de geschiedenis te vergelijken met mohammad
7927672 wij europeanen met alle onze begrippen konden niet bereiken wat mohammad heeft bereikt en niemand kon hem voorafgaan ik heb in de geschiedenis van mensheid gezocht naar een voorbeeld en vond dat het dus mohammad was omdat de waarheid nu eenmaal geopenbaard moet worden inderdaad mohammad slaagde erin de hele voledige staat zo wiskundig wereld naar het monothe sme te onderwerpen

7927718 nearly 25 lakh people are waging a grim battle against the floods which have assumed proportions of a catastrophe the nature is putting my government to test once again but we will succeed
7927719 after an inspection of flood prone areas in october 2007 the committee had recommended repair of damaged embankments by june 2008 to the state government but the state government failed to react and did not inform the concerned ministry about the situation till august 17
7927720 during surveys it was found that the state government is air dropping relief material into water the most important task at present is to bring to safety women and children marooned in flooded areas since the state government has failed in this the army should be handed over the task
7927721 lakhs of people are suffering but the government is doing nothing to help them
7927722 despite 20 districts being badly affected by floods in bihar the state government has failed to take adequate steps to provide relief to people it has made no estimate of loss of human lives

7927730 the ppp still desires that political forces should continue to sit together and strengthen democratic institutions to steer the country out of crisis

7927748 nothing was touched in the stalin museum even though it would have been quite possible to come in through the open windows
7927749 of course the russian soldiers were also here they wanted to visit the museum but we insisted that it was closed and we did not let them visit
7927750 of course we are proud of stalin he was a man of such talent and qualities we need leaders like stalin today he had authority
7927751 compare him with todays leaders like us president george w bush or georgian president mikheil saakashvili
7927752 why did the russians do this to gori it was here that stalin was born without him moscow could not have won the war
7927753 if a person works in a memorial museum and does not respect the person who is being remembered then they should not be working here
7927754 stalin was a great phenomenon he was born in that tiny hovel and then rose up he was a great strategist he won world war ii
7927755 i do not believe the lies about stalin leading the repression no one still knows what the reality was
7927756 we just know one thing that without stalin the world would have been in the hands of hitler these are the real facts
7927757 people have always come here from all over the world those who love stalin those who hate stalin and those who are just interested in him

7928043 however there really was no gray area regarding the legality of the service its an on demand offering and that requires direct licenses

7928048 the government orders the population to take precautions because this storm will bring a lot of rain
7928049 theres no rain and wind the sky is clear cars are traveling everywhere i dont think theres a hurricane
7928050 this will definitely put a dent in drought conditions but it wont end it
7928051 its like concrete youve got less vegetation and more areas exposed to runoff
7928052 we had a weather spotter who reported more than 27 inches

7928060 the santa barbara county board of supervisors are scheduled to vote on whether or not to change a long standing policy regarding offshore oil drilling the county staff report goes so far as to submit a proposed
7928061 the santa barbara county staff letter makes assertions about offshore oil drilling that are factually inaccurate and therefore misleading
7928062 there have been no significant spills in offshore production in the almost forty years since the santa barbara oil spill
7928063 extraction reduces pressure that causes seeps to occur thereby reducing the amount of oil and gas that is introduced in the water and air
7928064 an indication that we are pursuing increased oil extraction would immediately have a depressing effect on the international price of oil to the benefit of our country
7928065 making such a significant change in our countys policy regarding offshore oil drilling should at least be based on accuracy and fact not hysteria and conjecture
7928066 promoting increased offshore oil drilling will require additional oversight and environmental protection by the county of santa barbara we only need to look at how the county has managed on shore oil drilling by greka to ask ourselves why we should believe the public will be protected from the hazards of offshore oil drilling

7928071 my paintings are an attempt to catch the flashes of buried insight a haunting memory a sound a stillness from within i approach my painting as a journey i let the painting pull me along as if i am following an internal equation as i look for the solution i maintain balance within the work using a subtle palette of rusty orange yellow ochre pale greens and peaches as well as rich black dusty charcoal i strive to let the shapes converse with each other and the viewer using a host of almost familiar organic shapes layers of texture and faint colors i create a primitive dream and the paintings take on an otherworldly quality i use materials together in a non traditional manner to create a new world on canvas
7928072 when i paint mysteries unfold before me on the canvas i feel a meditative yet powerful connection to the work a sense of wholeness these paintings are a series of strange vignettes little timeless stories abstractions that touch the sky the earth and the mysterious happenings in between abstractions turn into something recognized a sense of place the expansive sky and horizon a place to feel the wind or wander through the darkness the land simply emerges
7928073 i love textures and how layers of color and texture come together
7928074 my work is about my love of color and the subtle changes that occur when colors overlap react and create something new i also love textures and how layers of color and texture come together i enjoy exploring space and balance in my work as well as different motifs that i find natural and comforting these shapes or design elements are repetitive at times and often peek out from a hidden space in the painting or brazenly take the foreground these shapes reflect my love of mark making and how i enjoy the imperfect smudge of charcoal of the gritty pencil line as it floats along the painted surface intuitively i bring all of these elements together to create an otherworldly atmosphere
7928075 i am an artist and i am preparing for a show here is a sample of my work
7928076 hello i am still here still painting dont forget about me
7928077 hi i am your name and i am a painter i have shown my work with your organization as a part of several group shows and i was wondering if you are accepting proposals for individual shows currently if so i would love to apply

7928085 i dont know i came back from signing the delivery receipt and found him lying in his tea
7928086 ill need to talk to her were you alone in the room with the cups of tea before richards arrived
7928087 there are indications of cyanide in the tea miss bradford
7928088 but how is that possible that tea is from my private collection and few people have access to it
7928089 of course not i wasnt happy about his building destroying the quaint character of jenks but i would never hurt the man
7928090 surely detective you dont suspect i had anything to do with mr richards death if i hadnt been called out right after he arrived to sign a delivery receipt i would have drunk the tea too
7928091 the most important thing is we would like the possibility to defend ourselves in the european court of justice
7928092 so aland got no chance to defend itself if there are penalties for finland to pay then according to the act of autonomy aland could be obliged to pay part of them
7928093 it would create a very awkward situation for the aland islands if they rejected the lisbon treaty we dont have experience of such a matter
7928094 today there is a strong feeling among our politicians that there is not a qualified majority in favour of lisbon
7928095 all of our political parties say wed like to say yes but were interested in first getting decent conditions
7928096 the finnish parliament cant represent aland in our fields of competence

7928106 a lot of children are getting drugs they shouldnt be getting
7928107 physicians attempt to treat childhood psychiatric illnesses with medications used in treating adult psychiatric illnesses often in the absence of good information about the safety and efficacy
7928108 i get calls all the time from parents and schools demanding kids be put on these medications for behavior
7928109 we really dont know the long term effects of antipsychotic drugs on the brain
7928110 leaving a major medical disorder untreated is corrosive to a childs education its very detrimental to their development
7928111 look at the school so many different things can contribute to a kid having problems parents should talk to someone about non drug options and not take the medical quick fix
7928112 drugs are cheaper and easier than fixing a parenting dysfunction
7928113 kids need structure they need limits they need rules the biggest problem i see with parents is not setting limits and when a child disobeys they dont punish
7928114 she was in her room and she wanted to die
7928115 they recommended we send her away to a special boarding school that was about 100 000 a year
7928116 she couldnt go to school she was losing weight and staying in her room i thought i would see a child who was schizophrenic
7928117 within 10 minutes of meeting her i was astonished she was not only remarkably conversant she had a sense of humor more adult than childlike
7928118 i saw a child whose life was about to be ruined by more treatment
7928119 i said why dont you send her away to a wilderness camp and let her reboot
7928120 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures

7928133 sylvi kekkonens wife came to wake me at half past six kovalev wanted an audience
7928134 the idea was that when the first incoming rocket was sent off porilaisten marssi would blare out from the firing stations and the blue and white flag with the lion insignia would be run up the mast
7928135 the lieutenants were rampaging about in their tanks with youthful enthusiasm outside lappeenranta and the word began to get passed around
7928136 at certain times we were even on cockpit readiness or in other words crews were sitting in the planes ready for immediate scramble the orders came down directly from the general staff
7928137 the open sea out in the gulf was clearly reserved as the playground for the soviet fleet
7928138 the movements of the warships were rather jittery several navy vessels anchored close to the helsinki caisson lighthouse located about 22km south of helsinki one was also anchored on the fairway leading in to porvoo though still in international waters in front of kotka the ships approached the edge of finnish territorial waters as if to provoke a reaction
7928139 at about the same time we were getting snippets of information about extensive tank formations and troop movements on the karelian isthmus the narrow strip of land between the border and st peterburg separating the gulf of finland from lake ladoga
7928140 at moments like that there is more of everything going on new troops brought up changes in military focus and placements in 1968 it was all go on that front but thats not to say it came as any kind of shock to the people in the border guard
7928141 there was talk that the ministry of the interior had phoned the newsdesk
7928142 they probably didnt want to have it told just how large the demonstration was or what the mood on the street was like
7928143 he wasnt even allowed to tell his family what he was up to
7928144 people had been a bit scared and skittish and even at that time they were very careful about what they said to me many swore that nothing out of the ordinary had happened
7928145 then again they didnt express any surprise that it might have been true this sort of thing does happen in border areas
7928146 on a couple of occasions i gave instructions that someone should go and listen to what ordinary people living in the frontier zone had to say
7928147 we felt a great sense of mistrust towards what we were getting in statements from the finnish security police we would ask and they would always deny it
7928148 it makes no sense really how the devil would tanks have got into a place like that and where did they think they would be going

7928176 for a government to treat a revered religious institution and leader in such a discriminatory manner is an affront to human and religious rights and shows disrespect to the hundreds of millions of orthodox christians
7928177 there must be fairness and freedom when it comes to the turkish governments treatment of the ecumenical patriarchate as turkey appeals to the european union for membership i would expect its treatment of the ecumenical patriarchate to be a prime topic that must be addressed
7928178 we are cognizant of the fact that the reconciliation and normalization of relations between our respective dioceses is part of the larger process of bringing the various orthodox jurisdictions together in the great work of an administratively united orthodox church on the american continent
7928179 tatas have communicated to all vendors that work at singur should continue as planned

7928182 we are currently supplying prototypes we will supply commercially depending on when the nano project rolls out
7928183 but if tata moves out then we can also have alternative plans and relocate
7928184 the game requests the player to be a hero and save black balloons by performing a number of energy saving actions such as switching off lights and appliances before the snowman melts because of the effects of climate change
7928185 we have designed this game to appeal to late primary school and early secondary school students but i think lots of adults may also enjoy playing it
7928186 the game really gives kids the understanding and empowers them by letting them know that their individual actions can reduce their impact on climate change
7928187 employers need to take some responsibility for the impact that overwork can have on their employees health with our research showing that a significant amount of it workers find it difficult to maintain relationships or suffer ill health the uks culture of working long hours needs to be addressed as businesses look to derive as much value from their people assets as possible during lean times it is going to be imperative that we dont drive employees to burnout
7928188 despite the predicted downturn we are still suffering a skills crisis so it is essential that we dont disillusion our skilled workers at a time when we need them most

7928564 i wore my abaya washed my face and took the children to my neighbor without saying a single word
7928565 i was in shock and the only thing i had in mind was my husband
7928566 in a moment the car stopped everything changed the way they were speaking with me moved from being kind to tough
7928567 i was scared and it worsened when a man with an ugly appearance appeared in the room and directly asked if i had a way to get the money to pay for my husbands life
7928568 i started to cry and say we were from a simple family and what we get from our work wasnt enough to pay our bills
7928569 the man said there was a way to pay for my husbands liberty as well as mine and told me to take my clothes off and lay down on the floor
7928570 i fought against him for a while but later discovered that i didnt have a choice and was raped by four militants who after all disgusting things they did to me drove me back home with my husband
7928571 he said he preferred to die than continue to be married to an impure woman
7928572 i saved his life but couldnt save mine after six years of marriage
7928573 im ashamed to talk about my problem but i have to sound the alarm for the world to help hundreds of women in iraq under the same circumstance
7928574 at least two times a week some men come to my house and have sex with me despite my appeals to them to stop
7928575 if my two kids are home they are forced to stay inside the bathroom until they finish there are days i cannot look into their eyes

7928577 i can feel from his voice that he might be sick
7928578 in the history of this country women have never been abused like now
7928579 even under a dictatorial regime saddam hussein was clear in his fight for women rights and protection but now we are nothing but animals
7928580 each woman abused in iraq is a degradation to all women rights in the world they give what they have most precious to save the lives of their loved ones and most of the times arent understood
7928581 after five years of invasion iraqi women have lost rights rather than got space and respect

7928586 they pay me from 5 to 8 dollars usually i have to have relation with at least two men so i can buy enough food for home
7928587 i know it is against all my religious and social principles but i cannot stay at home without money waiting for my children to die from hunger
7928588 im a mother and whatever i have to do to save their lives i will do it

7928864 topik apa yang paling penting bila anda ingin belajar make money from blog
7928865 bagaimana menarik minat pengunjung agar mau datang ke blog kita
7928866 in 50 years of interviews jerry siegel never once mentioned that his father died in a robbery
7928867 your father dies in a robbery and you invent a bulletproof man who becomes the worlds greatest hero im sorry but theres a story there
7928868 america did not get superman from our greatest legends but because a boy lost his father
7928869 superman came not out of our strength but out of our vulnerability
7928870 supermans invulnerability to bullets loss of family destruction of his homeland all seem to overlap with jerrys personal experience theres a connection there the loss of a dad as a source for superman
7928871 i believe i have the first accurate account jerrys father wasnt shot and robbed he had a heart attack during a robbery
7928872 had no pensions no contracts no health benefits and companies didnt even pay for the artists supplies when these artists tried to negotiate greater rights for themselves they were either collectively cast out or made false promises
7928873 having their names listed as supermans creators was the biggest victory of all
7928874 kurt vonnegut jules pfeiffer will eisner eli wallach and his wife were there
7928875 walter cronkite came on and they showed superman flying and he described what had happened at the end he said another triumph for truth justice and the american way
7928876 we opened champagne jerry and joe were there and it was a very emotional moment there wasnt a dry eye in the place
7928877 here you have people in their 80s and 90s seeing their comic book work being taken seriously
7928878 they are deriving economic benefits now either directly or through consultancies
7928879 it is gratifying to know people want to know about jerry siegel and that he is getting recognition for his creativity
7928880 it makes me wonder if hannity has anything above a 4th grade level education when it comes to the history of totalitarian movements
7928881 the ministry of peace concerns itself with war the ministry of truth with lies the ministry of love with torture and the ministry of plenty with starvation
7928882 for me it was the key moment of the race
7928883 i dont know if it was the team or the driver who made the error but first of all i can not understand why the stewards made their decision only after the race
7928884 they have all the information that is needed to make a judgement during the grand prix
7928885 making such changes needs a lot of co operation and we would especially like to thank the indonesian minister of youth and sport affairs dr adhyaksa dault and imi the national motorsports federation for consenting to this date change
7928886 our welcome in china has always been extremely warm and it is very gratifying that we have been invited to race at our fourth different track in this amazing country by the chinese government the chinese fans are some of the most passionate as can be seen by their support for the series and a1 team china also as we have seen with the recent olympics china knows how to put on great events
7928887 it is a great honour to have a1gp back in china especially with the new a1gp powered by ferrari cars the severity of the earthquake in sichuan province on the 12 may this year was a shock to everyone worldwide and both a1gp and a1 team china will take this opportunity to show support for the local people who have suffered so badly
7928888 i am sure the fans in chengdu will be able to show they are getting on with their lives and will give a1gp a warm welcome
7928889 the last time tens of thousands of armed sunni men were humiliated in iraq by disbanding the baath party and iraqi army in may 2003 an insurgency began costing thousands of u s lives and throwing iraq into chaos yet maliki and his advisors risk provoking iraqs sunni community into another round of violence
7928890 it doesnt take 100 000 of these guys to revert to insurgents to cause big trouble remember at the height of the insurgency the u s estimated that there were 8 000 20 000 fighters
7928891 the woman who had dominated discussions for so long could no longer lead debates or keep up with the thread of a drinks party conversation
7928892 on bad days she could hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she got to the end
7928893 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7928894 losing dad was truly awful for mum not least because her dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead
7928895 building the b reactor was a feat of engineering genius so too was the construction a testament to the excellence of working americans
7928896 theres an enormous amount of things that can be learned here whether its about enrico fermi the history of nuclear energy or how a nuclear plant works
7928897 we want people to be able to stop in and spend some time here
7928898 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7928899 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7928900 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7928901 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7928902 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7928903 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7928904 im from jalisco where they make tequila macho men arent afraid
7928905 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7928906 do you know who you are f ing with we are the police
7928907 if these allegations prove true its a horrendous case a horrendous situation
7928908 i keep having flashbacks to that moment im just scared
7928909 the reason why i got involved was simply because it was wrong and the other party was just trying to get into his car and to me seeing something like that is not something that should be going on no matter if its cops or regular civilians in new york city
7928910 well you may not be working there for much longer

7928917 even if it is 7 000 km from paris what happens in afghanistan still concerns our security
7928918 it is to create conditions that allow the afghan government and people to take their destiny into their own hands
7928919 we will of course draw all the lessons from the operation of august 18 as we draw them from all of our operations
7928920 the rise in violence which we are seeing is linked to the increasing number of operations by atlantic alliance and afghan forces in zones which were previously considered sanctuaries where we didnt go
7928921 it is because we are more and more active that there are more and more operations by the taliban

7928965 alvin clay asserts to this court that the admissible and credible evidence at trial was insufficient to support a conviction to commit wire fraud and further that there was no credible evidence worthy of consideration by the jury presented by the government to prove that he knowingly joined a conspiracy to launder money clay asserts that the verdict is contrary to the weight of evidence and that this court should outright acquit or order a new trial
7928966 in light of mccuiens testimony and the absence of any other evidence there is simply no evidence from which one could conclude that alvin clay participated in a conspiracy or otherwise knew that the proceeds in issue were derived from criminal activity
7928967 you told them they were going to get money but you dont know how it worked

7928983 the sense of the aliennes and difficulty of the past should reinforce for the believer the sense of astonishment at the range of human expression and experience that can be counted as christian and so fill out the doctrinal conviction that the work of christ is capable of translation into every human context of culture and imagination the sense of continuity reinforces the acknowledgment not always welcome in our own cultural environment that what we have found it possible to say is what we have learned what we have been taught what others have made possible for us we recognise ourselves and our concerns in a distant mirror and so are reminded that we are not our own authors that we have not just discovered what it is to be human let alone what it is to be christian and all this has the important consequence that if we are free to listen to the strange and recognisable otherness of the past this may help us in dealing with what is strange to us now an attitude of mind that is not capable of engaging in recognition with the past of the church is also one that is likely to be closed off from what is different or challenging in the present

7929029 because the united states is already so powerful even a small change in how others perceive the aggressiveness of u s intentions can cause other major powers to be concerned about their security

7929076 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
7929077 we will endeavour to carry out any searches as quickly as possible to minimise impact on the area concerned
7929078 however inquiries of this nature are complex and may take time to resolve

7929084 a unique insight into current thinking within the security service about how a modern day terrorist is made
7929085 based on hundreds of case studies of those involved in or closely associated with terrorism
7929086 we should never overstate the menace we face from violent extremism
7929087 entirely acceptable and indeed necessary for academics to seek to understand and explain what motivates violent extremists
7929088 this is unbearable physical torture it is purposeful controlled drowning
7929089 it is illegal and the people who work inside the federal courthouse are charged with the responsibility of enforcing these laws
7929090 we are pushing this material to uk media channels eg a bbc radio programme exposing tensions between aq leadership and supporters and a restricted working group will communicate niche messages through media and non media
7929091 they are not heroes and dont have answers and that they harm you your country and your livelihood
7929092 it is aimed primarily but not exclusively at those working with overseas influencers and opinion formers
7929093 use advisedly avoid suggesting that aq is no longer a threat we are not claiming victory over aq we are stressing their declining support
7929094 on the defensive throughout much of the rest of the world
7929095 feed its new franchises with propaganda to keep the brand alive at all costs
7929096 all the suspect cases have been diagnosed with listeriosis but it is only via laboratory testing the genetic fingerprinting that we can determine if they are directly linked
7929097 i think that as theyve acted extremely responsibly after a short while the consumers will forget about it theyve got a very short memory
7929098 i think all of us and obviously i include my own family in this we expect that when we shop that the things we buy or that we eat are going to be safe
7929099 this is a serious concern thats why i indicated that its necessary to reform and revamp our food and product inspection regimes
7929100 i think all members of the government has been on top of this
7929101 i think we all feel tremendously for those who have been affected by this terrible development and i want to express my condolences to those families that have been affected
7929102 all the suspect cases have been diagnosed with listeriosis but it is only via laboratory testing the genetic fingerprinting that we can determine if they are directly linked
7929103 i think that as theyve acted extremely responsibly after a short while the consumers will forget about it theyve got a very short memory
7929104 estoy en el ba o si has dejado el puto telefono ponte con el tema 6 y luego resumimos
7929105 aq is not the only extremist ideology of interest or concern domestically or overseas but countering the aq threat is a counterterrorism priority and requires aq centric communications efforts
7929106 it the narrative combines fact fiction emotion and religion and manipulates discontent about local and international issues the narrative is simple flexible and infinitely accommodating it can be adapted to suit local conditions and may have a disproportionate influence on understanding and interpretation of local or global events
7929107 the objective is not to dismiss grievances but undermine aqs position as their champion and violent extremism as the solution
7929108 our first tailored product with key arguments exposing the theme aq is losing support
7929109 this series of guidance alone will not fatally undermine the aq narrative but it can increase our impact against the narrative while we develop a bespoke and hard hitting campaign using private sector resources
7929110 we are in negotiations with several major communications companies to design and deliver high impact campaigns across media and non media channels
7929111 push these message themes to a wide range of contacts
7929112 if it looks too much like government propaganda then i dont think people are going to listen nor should they
7929113 shahbaz hussain alias shanu has played a very important role in the blasts that claimed 68 lives in jaipur and he has got strong linkage with abu bashar arrested from azamgarh uttar pradesh and sajid mansoori from gujarat in connection with ahmedabad blasts
7929114 the modus operandi of the entire blasts in jaipur is a part of investigation and interrogation but this is for sure that shahbaz is the main link in planning conspiring and execution of the bomb blasts
7929115 we think its really going to build on our best practices and lessons learned from our operations in iraq but recognizing that it needs to be tailored to the local afghan population
7929116 the big thing that he came out of there with is they were doing a warehouse operation
7929117 the problem seems to be more the detention than the treatment
7929118 the prime minister was not only for the extension of bilateral ties
7929119 nepal has also hoped that china would extend more assistance to nepal in the coming days

7929169 with bill clinton he is probably still ticked off with me but thats ok richardson said today
7929170 i did that endorsement because i thought senator obama was special it was more important for me to deal with whats good for the country than what is good in my political interest
7929171 we have been looking pretty heavily in rochester during the past year or so we had several different sites that interested us however because of the economy cash flow and all of the other good things that are not going on right now weve kind of backed off a little bit of our development in the rochester area not that were going to forget about you guys forever but for the rest of this year and probably next year theyll be no activity down there as far as i know hopefully things will change and the money situation improves then we can get down there so we can service everybody
7929172 this was by far some of the most incredible work ive done i dont regret this past year for second

7929176 this is not only about getting cheap car insurance online it is about equality in the marketplace we know internet access can mean a difference of hundreds of pounds over the year from deals on utility bills food to all other manner of other goods in a time when costs are rising should we not allow the poorest among us a chance to keep afloat

7929232 he mr leith endured the most brutal time in that car with a pistol to his head fearing every moment that he might be shot
7929233 he was then abandoned in a field tied by the hands still feeling and fearing he was going to be beaten up or worse before he was left
7929234 because of the media and the fans theres more energy or electricity in the ballpark but you cant bring in a pitcher an inning earlier they dont give you two wins when you beat the yankees so you cant do it differently

7929248 we need a whole new approach and we need to act now
7929249 our research shows that many of the worlds existing no take areas are in the wrong place
7929250 new protected zones are needed that focus on areas identified as escaping or recovering well from climate change impacts but a major focus needs to be shifted towards increasing the resilience of the system as a whole that means reducing as many other locally derived threats as possible
7929251 coral dies when it is put under stress so what we need to be doing is reducing the direct human impact such as over fishing pollution and sedimentation across the whole area
7929252 by removing all these other stresses we are giving the coral the best chance of surviving and recovering from any changes in temperature that may occur as a result of global warming
7929253 this provides the key to conserving coral reefs in the face of climate change
7929254 we are not suggesting that we scrap the existing ntas in terms of protecting fish stocks they have been quite successful

7929271 pour finir dans ma fa on de voir les choses personne nest fautif
7929272 je vais me lever et me d clarer en partie responsable et les oem videmment avec qui nous travailons ils le ressentent parce que ce sont leurs notebooks et quils sont en partie responsables si personne dautre ne se porte volontaire pour tre responsable je suis heureux de les laisser faire mais je nai pas besoin dattendre qui que ce soit dautre
7929273 cela a pris un long moment avant darriver une erreur

7929276 people are pretty excited anxious and ready to get back to normal life

7929284 we want cme to be unbiased and science driven and we dont want it to be influenced by marketing we want our educational activities for whomever we are serving whether its our own faculty or our colleagues in the community locally or globally to be true to the science and the evidence and not be influenced by any kind of financial industry support
7929285 bias either by appearance or reality has become woven into the very fabric of continuing education
7929286 under the present system in many circumstances a cme course will be held only if a commercial company is willing to sponsor it
7929287 while for profit enterprises may occasionally engage in philanthropy it should not be surprising that the core motivation of pharmaceutical and medical device industries in supporting cme is to market their products and services
7929288 this leads to a cme curriculum which is at least in part designed to address market needs rather than being entirely focused upon improving performance of practicing physicians
7929289 clearly it would be preferable for stanford faculty to design our cme curriculum solely based upon the needs of our learners as they seek to address the health care needs of their patients
7929290 we all agreed it is inappropriate for industry to influence content
7929291 if industry really wants to enhance the education of clinicians they should be given the opportunity to do so
7929292 but we wanted to create a situation in which they had no effect on the choice of topics or their content so were happy to have industry support as long as it is provided without strings or expectations about the course content
7929293 really brings control of cme curricula back to academic medical centers
7929294 one of my hopes is to make stanford a destination so we can hold cme programs here leveraging the wonderful cultural attractions on campus
7929295 i think right now industry is under a lot of pressure in its use of marketing for education theyre re examining their role in cme as well
7929296 as we take this step my hope is that other institutions will start to follow suit i think the climate will change dramatically to enforce that if institutions do not take greater responsibility there is going to be a mandate whether its one that we initiate or one that is imposed that frees up these intertwined interactions of academia and industry around medical education
7929297 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
7929298 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
7929299 the methods in this study can be used to forecast future costs and will provide important additional means for validating program evaluations that previously did not exist
7929300 the prevalence of adhd is concerning to the medical community adhd may affect adults in their professional life social life and relationships
7929301 vyvanse is a recently approved adhd treatment option for the adult population in a clinical study with adults vyvanse was shown within the first week to significantly improve adhd symptoms inattention such as the ability to focus and organize and hyperactivity and impulsivity such as restlessness and interrupting

7929303 as a result of a complaint filed by mattel the copyright and trademark holder of scrabble everywhere outside the us and canada against the developers of scrabulous facebook has restricted access to scrabulous to users in all countries except india

7929343 he is a player i have full admiration for i remember him at aberdeen where he was held in such high esteem
7929344 unfortunately no sooner had he signed than he picked up an injury and obviously he ended up finding it hard to get back into roy keanes side
7929345 but there is no doubting the quality he has we have seen him at close quarters and he did well on loan at plymouth last season and he will be a tremendous acquisition

7929430 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
7929431 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
7929432 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7929433 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7929434 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7929435 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
7929436 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform
7929437 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design

7929461 after 18 months in government the snp are riding high theyre popular but heres my prediction by 2010 they wont be
7929462 you can already see the underlying weaknesses that will undo alex salmond what looks like confidence surefooted and wily today will seem arrogant misguided and politically dishonest tomorrow spin is the hallmark of this government but spin has a shelf life
7929463 he will bring energy and enthusiasm to the role taking the fight to the snp and labour right across scotland
7929464 tavish will address the issues that matter most to the people of scotland not the narrow minded squabbles of the nationalists and labour

7929513 there have been indications that farocean is now prepared to meet with us and we await a response from them so that we can settle this matter speedily
7929514 the rim keeps on saying that it doesnt have the money to pay me i believe it will though
7929515 it is not our intention to disrupt our intention is for everybody to hear our grievance
7929516 we can no longer be spectators while our president is being lynched it has become clear that billy downer and anton steynberg are waging a political battle using the state instrument
7929517 the liver donors are getting fatter and the problem there is the livers arent so good
7929518 once theres a certain amount of fat in the liver were reluctant to transplant because theres a high risk that its never going to work properly
7929519 we were not aware then that people with severe fatty infiltration of the liver when you took that liver cooled it down and transplanted it the liver just doesnt function
7929520 there is no demonstrable need for it and the nras argument that there is is just preposterous
7929521 what tourist is going to get up at six oclock in the bloody morning to go shopping theyd rather be in the surf

7929523 seven years ago these little sookiess got their nose in the extended trading hours trough by starting with one application on the gold coast then extended it to the sunshine coast then to brisbane and away they went
7929524 ever since they have been criss crossing the nation targeting regional areas and pushing for trading hours extensions that quite frankly just arent needed
7929525 i know hes not an evil man theres not evil in his heart
7929526 i know that i love him i know that much
7929527 were just not going to rush anything were gonna walk through the process however slowly it needs to happen in order for the healing and restoration to be complete and then well go from there
7929528 im actually seeking professional counselling myself i need to be able to unravel a lot of emotion thats bombarding me at the moment i owe it to myself to work through that properly and to him
7929529 i had questions after the shock of it all but my initial thoughts after hearing that were a sense of sorrow for the church and that a lot of people were going to be hurt because of it
7929530 i was the first one he told he confessed everything to me
7929531 he just went through it where it had started everything in his life as a young kid the patterns he was crying sobbing actually absolutely sobbing he just said i dont have cancer
7929532 he was terrified i still remember the look on his face it was a very hard moment for him as it was for me hearing it
7929533 i could just see a really broken unwell man at that point i found it really quite hard to get angry
7929534 seeing your husband of seven years absolutely sobbing in front of you risking everything coming forward and telling the truth in that instance it was really hard to be angry or mad
7929535 i never questioned it when you love someone you trust them i had no reason not to trust him
7929536 perhaps i feel a little bit foolish in this hindsights a fabulous thing but im trying not to beat myself up
7929537 in the middle of the night he was in so much pain i would put towels in the microwave to try and give him some relief in his back
7929538 before i stopped working to care for him i was busy hed have doctors appointments when i couldnt be there and he would say its fine you dont need to be there
7929539 or i would just drop him off at the hospital
7929540 were only talking two weeks since admitting his lies theres a lot of stuff to deal with
7929541 that sort of side of things hasnt really hit me yet theres many levels and layers to everything i can almost talk about it like im removed from it thats where the professional help will help me work through that it hasnt hit me yet

7929544 throughout his life masilela worked to uphold the values and advance the objectives of the liberation movement he was prepared to undertake any tasks given to him
7929545 the anc salutes the memory of che masilela whose contribution to the people of south africa will never be forgotten
7929546 his knowledge and experience will be sorely missed in the security cluster and government as a whole as well as in the anc
7929547 masilela left a legacy of hard work and sound ethics and will be sorely missed
7929548 the da learned with great shock of the passing away of masilela under tragic circumstances we wish to convey our heartfelt sympathies to his bereaved family and wish them gods strength we pray for their well being through this trying period of grief
7929549 comrade che had dedicated his life to fighting injustice and bettering the lives of the people of our country
7929550 when he starts he tries to conserve his pitches and the radar gun will show low 90s at times and batters can deal with low 90s when he comes out of the bullpen he doesnt have to worry about what pitches he is going to use and he blows the ball right by batters with his 100 mph heat theres also a reason why he has such a high pitch count early in the game as well he only knows how to strike batters out he doesnt have that one pitch that well make a player swing at the first pitch and ground out to the infield that would lower his pitch count
7929551 while not a groundswell of optimism it is encouraging that confidence did not continue to falter and even rose modestly

7929889 the market almost always marks time ahead of a fed announcement and the minutes coming out later has people on the sidelines
7929890 estoy casi recuperado y he podido entrenarme con el equipo a mi ritmo y poco a poco
7929891 ganas no solo los resultados de pretemporada sino porque la manera de jugar es buena y este a o creo que vamos a dar mucha guerra
7929892 ya iba siendo hora de que llegase el inicio de liga porque es lo que realmente nos importa lo importante empieza ahora porque la pretemporada aunque sali bien realmente el resultado que va a predominar es el del s bado en un encuentro que ser dif cil
7929893 siempre coloco al equipo en el vag n de delante pero nos lo tenemos que ganar tambi n los rivales nos est n teniendo en cuenta pero a mi me gusta siempre ir de tapado
7929894 ya nos tienen en cuenta por la plantilla y la pretemporada que hemos hecho y nos colocan arriba
7929895 dont talk science with them let them believe what they want to believe
7929896 isnt there some myth youve heard that you dont necessarily believe
7929897 im skeptical of bigfoot for the exact same reasons you are tell me why you dont believe in bigfoot
7929898 we agree that part of the reason bigfoot is suspect is that we have low quality evidence coming from people with dubious credentials we can also find those same problems with the claim that you can run your car on water also we agree that one reason bigfoot is improbable is that if it was real wed have known about it by now people have been living in bigfoot habitat for hundreds of years we can say that same thing about running your car on water science has known all about oxyhydrogen and electrolysis for hundreds of years and exploited it many different ways it wouldnt have to wait for some guy on the internet to claim to know something that science doesnt
7929899 that announcement you heard alerts us to the possibility that this new breakthrough is true just as the recent bigfoot news story alerted us that a bigfoot body might have been found but science doesnt determine the validity of a theory based on whether or not its proponents have sent out a single press release an announcement that would be more interesting would be that the test protocols have been published and the experiment is being successfully replicated all over the world
7929900 what are you skeptical of well im probably skeptical of it for the exact same reason you are
7929901 es f tbol y cuanto m s ambiente haya mejor estos son partidos para demostrar que uno es futbolista por lo que nos jugamos por el ambiente y por el resultado que cosecharon ellos en riazor sinceramente el ambiente no me preocupa demasiado
7929902 queremos seguir en la copa de la uefa si no pasamos adi s pero no hay cosas positivas en una eliminaci n hay que pensar en seguir adelante si no se puede mala suerte
7929903 no creo que haga el mismo planteamiento que aqu el hajduk es un equipo con jugadores ofensivos aunque en riazor no lo demostraron
7929904 el equipo se siente a gusto con los dos sistemas y eso es una ventaja casi con toda seguridad saldremos con una l nea de cuatro defensas aunque hay aspectos a mejorar tanto para este partido como para el resto de la temporada
7929905 dependemos mucho de lo que pase el jueves si estamos en uefa jugaremos los jueves y los domingos y no habr mucho tiempo de recuperaci n y se va a necesitar mucha m s gente que el a o pasado tenemos que pensar en esa circunstancia
7929906 la liga de campeones y la uefa tienen dos problemas la primera causa mucho cansancio y la uefa tiene el problema de que se juega los jueves y que la recuperaci n para el fin de semana puede no ser adecuada
7929907 casi siempre estoy preocupado por eso tengo arrugas brome pero estoy ilusionado con esta temporada contento con la plantilla pero vamos a esperar
7929908 quer a probarme en una liga tan fuerte como la acb
7929909 para m es un honor jugar en un equipo de este nivel estoy aqu porque soy un jugador ambicioso y quer a probarme en una liga tan fuerte como la acb probablemente la m s fuerte de europa
7929910 fundamentalmente soy un tirador aunque tambi n puedo jugar bien en defensa y un baloncesto de equipo me siento c modo jugando tanto de 2 como de 3 e incluso si es necesario tambi n podr a jugar de base
7929911 es un jugador que viene a dar m s valor y a reforzar todav a m s nuestra plantilla un jugador en el que tenemos mucha confianza y que viene con toda la ilusi n del mundo a incorporarse a este proyecto e insistimos esperamos y deseamos que nos aporte todo lo que ha venido haciendo esta ltima temporada en su equipo

7929953 i was a true skeptic from the start but all that has changed i am convinced that using the program has dramatically changed the way i relate to lifes opportunities and challenges i cant believe how simple it is
7929954 i can guarantee you whether youre a beginner or whether youre advanced in that process or practice centerpointes technology is absolutely phenomenal i personally use it on a daily basis and it has helped me take my personal meditation practice to a whole new height
7929955 here are some of the 20 benefits ive received in the first two months of the program tremendous focus and concentration better sleep increased energy better digestion more confidence more creativity
7929956 not everybody has two hours a day to sit nor do many people have the discipline to sit there for two hours and meditate they just dont have the time or the patience holosync really helps you do that it helps you get the benefits of meditation without making that much effort
7929957 ive been using holosync for years now and my meditations have gotten much deeper i travel with the cds i listen to them on a daily basis and as a result i have more freedom of expression a greater sense of relaxation and being stress free and a greater sense of personal power
7929958 i tried the awakening prologue cds and i was floored this is exactly what i was looking for not only that but the sounds on the cds themselves are so accommodating to what i like to hear when i meditate rainfall temple bells it was like coming home
7929959 extremely beneficial with each subject feeling as if his or her mind had reached a higher level of integration with accompanying increases in mental powers and an unmistakable reorientation toward life
7929960 i noticed effects from the first day i experienced a greater sense of confidence well being i experienced a sense of euphoria and also a sense that finally i found something that is making changes to me and is living up to the promises it made
