8670222 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8670223 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics

8670260 i was a 29 year old kid running for the united states senate in 1972 there was somewhere between six and 10 busloads of people from scranton who just spontaneously got on a bus and came down literally there were hundreds of thousands of people
8670261 barack obama couldve made that speech were he alive in 1972
8670262 by the way if i hear one more time that he was 11 years old when i went to the senate im going to smack somebody
8670263 mr bolthouse has said im not connected to bolthouse farms at all but we dont accept that
8670264 its a free country you can give as much money to this campaign but we are going to publicize that and people can make a decision on whether or not they want to support those businesses
8670265 to tell a business owner that they cant express their beliefs on an issue is a really stupid thing
8670266 we have received support from those that are in favor of prop 8 which has made up for some of what is being lost as a result of the boycott nonetheless we are saddened by all the divisive nature of the movement
8670267 we absolutely dont have a position on the proposition itself but we have a really strong long track record of inclusiveness in terms of the way we welcome our guests and the way we treat our employees doug manchester in no way speaks for hyatt
8670268 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government
8670269 we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy people are suffering
8670270 that is the mandate that he mugabe was given by the sadc southern african development community regional bloc and he is not going to stop forming that new cabinet the mdc are not serious at all
8670271 we shall soon be setting up a government the mdc does not want to come in apparently
8670272 this time they have been promised by the british that sanctions would be more devastating that in six months time the government will collapse i do not know when that day will come i wish tsvangirai well on that day
8670273 this cabinet that i had was the worst in history
8670274 they look at themselves they are unreliable but not all of them
8670275 its very clear that if he announces the new cabinet its a declaration of war against the people
8670276 you cant just have a cabinet without a mandate otherwise what he is doing is a recipe for disaster
8670277 i dont think mugabe and his close advisors will be in a hurry to revive the dialogue the hardliners are likely to harden their position
8670278 everyone is excited having the president come to your town is like winning the lotto
8670279 they have the ability to essentially choke off that port

8670287 trends that we have seen in a number of reports over the last 20 to 25 years show that the differences in life expectancy are widening
8670288 if you look at the fifth most affluent area of population in glasgow life expectancy is improving
8670289 but if you look at the fifth most deprived which includes calton it is static
8670290 it hasnt improved so there is a widening gap between the rich and the poor
8670291 you could argue there is quite a chunk of the population that has been left behind
8670292 that has happened in an area where some of the policies havent done enough to attack that problem
8670293 it is absolutely inexcusable that life expectancy in glasgow is lower than that of india where 80 of the population live in poverty
8670294 clearly the areas challenges are complex and will not be resolved overnight but action must be taken on the blights that have held us back for too long
8670295 i have been frustrated by the inaction of previous administrations to make real changes in the area but heartened by the news that the scottish government is taking health inequality seriously

8670298 truly truly i say to you the son can do nothing of himself unless it is something he sees the father doing for whatever the father does these things the son also does in like manner

8670319 the acting high commissioner calls for thorough and independent investigations into all killings that have occurred so far

8670321 because i believe his holiness is making a positive influence in our world for me the film represented an opportunity to continue assisting the optimistic efforts of an extraordinary individual
8670322 the theology of jonathan edwards and his insight into the nature of religious experience are simply too important too relevant and too enriching to sacrifice on the altar of some lofty ideal that is beneath his and our dignity to make his work accessible to a more general audience
8670323 for who will deny that true religion consists in a great measure in vigorous and lively actings of the incarnation and will of the soul or the fervent exercises of the heart
8670324 that which many call the witness of the spirit this kind of knowledge knowing that a certain person is converted and delivered from hell and entitled to heaven is no divine sort of knowledge in itself
8670325 the evidence of this in scripture is very abundant if we judge the nature of christianity and the proper spirit of the gospel by the word of god this spirit is what may by the way of eminency be called the christian spirit and may be looked upon as the true and distinguishing position of the hearts of christians as christians

8670333 know this when one of your coaches is asking for perfection or damn near it there is an unwritten agreement that it may not happen immediately we understand this but believe truly that over time you are capable of developing beyond your current standard the coachs job is to re inforce the things you know that you know remind you of the things you forget you know and teach you the things you didnt know you didnt know all you have to do is fight for it the process is the important part of this journey and part of that process is fighting for perfection none of us will ever attain perfection in many of the skills we practice but merely get closer to mastery the struggle is where the learning is and shouldnt be approached or dismissed lightly it is your responsibility to truly want to improve no matter what your current skill level so enjoy the process enjoy the road but most of all enjoy the struggle even if its not perfect fight for it

8670389 i heard that the original plan in the 1960s was to put the us base on aldabra island but the royal society and the smithsonian institute objected due to the potential effects on the native tortoise population
8670390 as a condition of receiving the money they were obliged to sign highly detailed legalistic forms written in english renouncing all rights against the government including the claim to return to their islands
8670391 these forms were not explained or translated and when the money was disbursed in 1982 the chagossians were required merely to put their thumb print to a piece of paper which they thought was a mere form a receipt
8670392 the comoros islands and others have already been terribly damaged due to over exploitation the chagos islands seem to be the larder for the west indian ocean they can either be left to provide for all who require it or used up in a few years to support a non sustainable native population there might be scope for a middle way but the returning home proposal goes nowhere near suggesting a sensible course of action
8670393 they can either pass new primary legislation which would empower them to banning the islanders from returning or they need to put in the infrastructure to get them back
8670394 the chagossians are extremely well aware of the value and fragility of their environment and would be beneficial in looking after it

8670448 i started to learn magic with my interest to do so i just want to use magic to touch other people and what better way to do that than to find other aspiring magicians who are like me before i know kasi that these people wouldnt use magic for detrimental purposes

8670482 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done

8670571 america has forgotten kate smiths song god bless america they are cursing america more than blessing her with their words their words have power i have not forgotten her i love her if they dont begin to bless america she will go down
8670572 but the word is very near you in your mouth and in your mind and in your heart so that you can do it see i have set before you this day life and good and death and evil
8670573 if you obey the commandments of the lord your god which i command you today to love the lord your god to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances then you shall live and multiply and the lord your god will bless you in the land into which you go to possess
8670574 but if your mind and heart turn away and you will not hear but are drawn away to worship other gods and serve them i declare to you today that you shall surely perish and you shall not live long in the land which you pass over the jordan to enter and possess
8670575 i call heaven and earth to witness this day against you that i have set before you life and death the blessings and the curses therefore choose life that you and your descendants may live
8670576 and may love the lord your god obey his voice and cling to him for he is your life and the length of your days that you may dwell in the land which the lord swore to give to your fathers to abraham isaac and jacob
8670577 and as to his divine nature according to the spirit of holiness was openly designated the son of god in power in a striking triumphant and miraculous manner by his resurrection from the dead even jesus christ our lord the messiah the anointed one
8670578 by means of these he has bestowed on us his precious and exceedingly great promises so that through them you may escape by flight from the moral decay rottenness and corruption that is in the world because of covetousness lust and greed and become sharers partakers of the divine nature
8670579 for this very reason adding your diligence to the divine promises employ every effort in exercising your faith to develop virtue excellence resolution christian energy and in exercising virtue develop knowledge intelligence and in exercising knowledge develop self control and in exercising self control develop steadfastness patience endurance and in exercising steadfastness develop godliness piety and in exercising godliness develop brotherly affection and in exercising brotherly affection develop christian love
8670580 for as these qualities are yours and increasingly abound in you they will keep you from being idle or unfruitful unto the full personal knowledge of our lord jesus christ the messiah the anointed one
8670581 for whoever lacks these qualities is blind spiritually shortsighted seeing only what is near to him and has become oblivious to the fact that he was cleansed from his old sins
8670582 because of this brethren be all the more solicitous and eager to make sure to ratify to strengthen to make steadfast your calling and election for if you do this you will never stumble or fall
8670583 i do not call you servants slaves any longer for the servant does not know what his master is doing working out

8670888 judging by these surveillance photos you should get that thing on your ass looked at
8670889 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits
8670890 winter officially ended this week so thats good news yeah today al gore blamed the end of winter on global warming sunday of course is easter another big problem for barack obama this easter sunday wheres he gonna go to church easter of course is the time we celebrate miracles see we dont have miracles like easter and the resurrection and the parting of the red sea anymore you know what im saying like today our idea of a miracle is gas under 3 50 a gallon boy there is nothing but disasters in the news its unbelievable floods in the midwest fires in texas the democratic party its just unbelievable to give you an idea how bad the democrats are doing in a stunning reversal john mccain now 10 ahead of hillary clinton and 7 ahead of barack obama and this is after iraq a recession and no health care imagine how far ahead hed be if the republicans had actually done something this week john mccain received a warm welcome in israel he was in israel you know he is hugely popular in israel ever since he stood with the jewish people against the pharaoh theyve never forgotten president bushs approval rating has reached a record low 31 wow his popularity is so low now on his facebook page he only has imaginary friends the cover of time magazine asked the question what did hillary do as first lady well we know what she didnt do bill and osama bin laden has released another anti american speech and out of force of habit barack obama denounced the remarks and said he wasnt even in the room at the time the statements were being made anyway critics are pouring over osama bin ladens latest audio tape simon called it pretentious paula said it was not his best work and randy said dog its just not working for me according to a new study by the university of british columbia and harvard money can buy happiness but only if you spend the money on someone else to which former governor eliot spitzer said see according to the new york post eliot spitzer has entered therapy for his sex addiction he has sex addiction hes not horny a sex addiction see i dont know if its gonna work when the therapist told him it was 300 bucks an hour he said what can i get for an extra 50 have you heard about this playgirl magazine made an offer to eliot spitzer to appear naked in the magazine isnt that unbelievable i tell you you know who really wants to see that spread former new jersey governor jim mcgreevey in tibet the rumor is the dalai lama might be stepping down yeah it turns out he was client number 11
8670891 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
8670892 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
8670893 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
8670894 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
8670895 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president
8670896 hillary clinton evoked themes of sisterhood and motherhood while addressing women voters in blue bell today and reminded them shed be a strong commander in chief and a fighter for universal health care
8670897 we have seen changes that are unimaginable for our mothers and grandmothers
8670898 there were colleges i couldnt go to scholarships i couldnt apply for
8670899 there must be a republican gremlin in the sound system
8670900 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue
8670901 to solve the current crisis hillary clinton believes we need sorely missed proactive policies that ask what is best for families on main street
8670902 i take it as given that the stadiums of recently promoted teams are really difficult
8670903 we saw the nerazzurri in the super cup and they are a battleship we will take them on showing the utmost respect
8670904 fiorentina acquired the right to be in the race for the title
8670905 the good news is that we have some players coming back tomorrow gary neville will play nani will be back from suspension so things are looking a bit better for us now
8670906 its important to win it the super cup of course but its also really important for us to get players back on the pitch
8670907 he will get 45 minutes to get him started back on the road park is with us he will play part of the game i dont think we will start him
8670908 he has had all his treatment now and has trained for the last 10 days very well
8670909 we have got to be confident we feel he has had the right treatment now its a matter of getting on with it
8670910 for some reason in my mental capacity of understanding what an important game is i played a weakened team
8670911 i played a lot of reserves when i saw lazio celebrating at the end of the game i said to myself that wont happen again they celebrated as if they had won the world cup it will be a good strong side tomorrow
8670912 there is no excuse for us we just have to go out there and win
8670913 ferguson is top of the world if he can work 25 years at a club like manchester with all the pressure then you have really exceptional qualities
8670914 it is a very exciting game for us there is no pressure
8670915 ive no idea whats going on its very hard to get communication with some people in life
8670916 i always give the lineup on the day of the game first to the players
8670917 they are one of the few teams even away from home where on every cross they have four players in the penalty box
8670918 most people will make us favourite but that does not come into our preparation for the game

8670976 my advice to managers of leading brands is to focus on one or two characteristics that set a brand apart from competitors even though they have much more to offer quite often marketing messages consist of repetitive similitude as we suffer from an inability to choose one thing and commit to it also brands should be focused more where it counts that is with customers brand managers are often immersed in their day to day programs and meetings they tend to loose touch with those who really matter to the success of a brand
8670977 whilst advertising can create brand awareness through buying space pr has to earn its space and therefore if done successfully changes the way people think about a brand pr used strategically enhances credibility and reputation and is therefore essential in creating a leading brand
8670978 there is no short term pr solution to creating a leading brand it is a long term process comprised of building relations with an audience through supplying them with honest and factual information in a clear concise manner as the information gets filtered by the media facts should always be truthful as a good journalist will conduct thorough research before placing a story this is the main reason why information disseminated through pr is more widely accepted by the public

8671021 con la firma de estos convenios se agilizar n las actuaciones de suelo para fomentar la vivienda protegida

8671029 this is the first time technology has been used to help manage risk and predict growth for early stage companies
8671030 for more established companies quantitative systematic decision making for investors is standard using technology driven credit rating services such as moodys and standard amp poors but until now no similar system has existed for companies in their earliest stages
8671031 we learned that a companys dna the fundamental things that can strongly influence its future success is generally formed in the very first days that the company is in business
8671032 our technology analyzes data based on those early days going back to the pure concept and the bones of the business built by the founders our research has proven that the patterns in the data we measure from those days can be surprisingly prophetic about how a company will perform in the future
8671033 recent scientific findings in the field of social network analysis have allowed us to accurately measure and quantify the social network of a team and its individual team members
8671034 the precise composition and position of the startup founding team within the social graph have both been shown to offer significant insights on the startups potential for success
8671035 as entrepreneurs seek seed and early stage investments in their startup companies we believe startup predictors results and younoodle score will become a core part of the pitch
8671036 in 2007 vcs and angels invested more than 67 billion in cash in startups in the united states alone decisions made subjectively without any kind of standardization to the process our sophisticated technology will provide a baseline based on powerful data to change the way those decisions are made

8671055 he started and stopped three times before the crowd quieted enough to let him speak and those several minutes while eating up the time allotted to him which he was destined to ignore in any case served to remind everyone that for all of the controversy that seems to swirl around him in and out of office in and out of the campaigns he still holds an uncommon place in the modern democratic pantheon as the partys only two term president of the postwar era
8671056 it is the most repetitive theme of clintons political life that he always finds a path to redemption when he is down and in many ways he proved that again with this speech and he might also have accomplished something larger and less self centered by doing all he could to bring obama up at the same time

8671077 vom hochdefizit ren rtl shop zum beispiel h tten andere bieter am ende lieber die finger gelassen sagt ein branchenexperte
8671078 iain i was wondering how things were going with your tweetdeck development would you care to share your experience so far with uservoice
8671079 the most obvious experience ive had using uservoice is the benefit of not having to keep track of all the suggestions people make about the application this benefit comes in two parts the amount of time saved and not being overly distracted when focusing on development it also seems that having a suggestion written down in front of them encourages some users to comment on suggestions so not only do i get the original suggestion logged but i also get possible refinements to that suggestion via the comments pretty much without having to lift a finger in fact the only thing i have had to do is set up the page in the first place which was essentially a few introductory lines of copy a logo and a few suggestions of my own to get the ball rolling
8671080 any idea what percentage of your users have engaged your uservoice page since youve been pushing it
8671081 as an incredibly rough estimate id say its around the 15 20 mark
8671082 so youre saying that of all your users 15 20 are active on uservoice
8671083 actually im saying around 15 20 of the total user base have been active at one point or another i doubt they are all active on a general basis
8671084 alright so youve got all of this rich feedback how are you priming the pump as it were to get people involved
8671085 the thing ive done and this is rather vital is drive users to the tweetdeck uservoice site in order to add their suggestion ive done this in two very simplistic ways add the uservoice tab to the tweetdeck homepage when someone makes a suggestion via twitter i ask them to add or vote on if already suggested the suggestion to the site i havent yet had a single person refuse to do this every single person ive spoken to has been more than happy people who make the effort to suggest a feature or tell you whats wrong with your application actually care a lot about it or they wouldnt bother so getting them to commit their ideas criticisms to the uservoice page is a very natural thing to do and of course it is the opinion of these people who use tweetdeck and care about its continued development that i hold with most importance and listen to
8671086 has implementing a uservoice feedback forum had an effect in the way you are developing tweetdeck
8671087 its worth pointing out that from day one i have had a vision for tweetdeck i know exactly where i want it to end up what functionality it will eventually have

8671202 india plays a significant role in south asia we accept that india is feeling that it does not have the required resources of energy perhaps this could be an area of cooperation with kazakhstan we could also cooperate with indias policy in afghanistan indias balanced approach to the situation in iran is praiseworthy
8671203 from a trade point of view it is a very key issue to be addressed as the indian market is a very big one
8671204 yes we can discuss this countrys involvement in the project
8671205 we will tell the people that we are diversifying the economy maybe russia and china could get jealous about such an initiative an oil relationship with iran kazakhstan sees this as most beneficial we need to take the u s on board we have to take the opinions of big countries for trading with iran if the situation in afghanistan does not improve we can trade with south asia through iran and therefore a diplomatic solution is required for the iran nuclear issue

8671262 you have a man running for president on the democratic ticket who believes in selective infanticide joined by a pro abortion catholic with delegates at the convention which are wildly out of step with what americans feel about this serious subject and you have the speaker of the house who doesnt even know what her religion teaches about the subject

8671265 and saint augustine said at three months we dont know the point is that it shouldnt have an impact on a womans right to choose
8671266 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
8671267 to misrepresent what the catholic church teaches on the subject and which the catechism has said that from the first century the catholic church has been opposed to abortion that its never changed its teaching on the subject and when she said ive been studying this for a long time one has to wonder about her cognitive abilities

8671300 to not become angry over insignificant things not to go to the mat over some minor provocation by a guard that resulted in needless torture
8671301 i have witnessed incidents where he has used profanity at colleagues and exploded at colleagues he would disagree about something and then explode it was incidents of irrational behavior weve all had incidents where we have gotten angry but ive never seen anyone act like that
8671302 he has a lot of support around the country but i dont think he has a lot of support from people who know him well
8671303 sometimes he was pretty angry but i felt as if he was putting on a show
8671304 i dont know if it was an emotional eruption or it was for effect
8671305 im embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics i failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble
8671306 again sorry for the confusion but please be assured i wont make the same mistake again
8671307 i think he is mentally unstable and not fit to be president

8671310 just because someone says its there you would have to provide some corroboration that it was
8671311 because i do not lose my temper i do not
8671312 now do i speak strongly do i feel frustrated from time to time of course if i didnt i dont think i would be doing my job but for someone to say that mccain became just angry and yelled or raised my voice or its just not true its simply not true
8671313 every time i ever lost my temper i regretted it since then
8671314 led to believe that this the invasion of iraq would be some kind of a day at the beach
8671315 time the rest of the nation learned about the john mccain we know in arizona

8671320 i began taking small amounts of income from charities and other sources to fund basic business costs with the intention of returning the monies when my profit position improved
8671321 roberts was in a position of trust and his actions have had devastating consequences for the charities and people involved
8671322 he was regarded as a family friend by two of the victims which has made his deceit even harder for them to bear roberts not only used the cash he had stolen to pay his business debts he also used it to fund his own lifestyle owning two properties and putting his children through university
8671323 the charities involved have had substantial amounts of cash stolen from them cash that they rely upon to be able to continue providing help and services to vulnerable people
8671324 the future of some of the charities is under threat as a result and i only hope they are able to get some of their money back now this case is over

8671572 howard industries runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants

8671586 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery as this is the paramount consideration at this point in time

8671588 she would like to convey her gratitude for the many expressions of support she has received and most especially to those health care professionals who have provided her care
8671589 we regret that we missed the opportunity to tell matthew mitchams story we apologize for this unintentional omission
8671590 discrimination has no place in a nation founded on the promise of equality
8671591 will one white lie send someone to hell for all eternity
8671592 we are very very cautious about the rest of the year we dont foresee a turnaround until at earliest the second half of next year and even that may be a bit optimistic
8671593 and other customers will start coming back online from there on
8671594 weve been having some capacity issues flexiscale has been growing at about 30 per cent a month in terms of usage weve been adding capacity and adding capacity and we were in the process of adding even more when one of the engineers who was tidying things up on the disk architecture made a mistake
8671595 after consulting with our storage vendor it was agreed the most sensible option would be to copy the entire volume to a new disk structure still maintaining its integrity and structure from where we could re mount it correctly
8671596 unfortunately due to its size we didnt have spare capacity on the platform to create a complete duplicate of it
8671597 this shouldnt have happened shouldnt have been allowed to happen but it happened well be putting things into place that will prevent this from happening in the future
8671598 so if something like this were to happen again customers could fall over to an other data centers
8671599 we were resource constrained we will complete another round of funding in the next few weeks
8671600 one of my pet projects is interoperability and portability between cloud computing devices basically the ability to move from one to another if something goes wrong

8671608 well uh you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or uh a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh above my pay grade
8671609 the xohm mobile broadband experience will be largely location centric

8671611 it would help establish mutual trust lower the chance of misunderstanding and prevent conflicts if both sides of the taiwan strait could jointly participate in international activities
8671612 it will only help strengthen the peaceful development of both sides if our country could participate in international activities
8671613 i would call it an isolated case that occurred as we push the policy of cross strait reconciliation and a diplomatic truce
8671614 the people of taiwan have always wanted to expand their nations participation in international organizations with dignity
8671615 we hope beijing will pay attention to the political reality in the taiwan strait and change the approach it has adopted
8671616 we have always said that diplomatic truce means neither taiwan nor china will steal away each others allies based on the mutual goodwill but the government will never relax its efforts for more participation in international organizations
8671617 we are not surprised that beijing retained its usual stance but unlike before beijing said the issue of taiwans international space could be resolved through consultation
8671618 in the international arena we should fight the fight when necessary
8671619 the russian president raised the possibility of continuing the dialogue and the discussion

8671625 i think aaron rodgers is given an excellent opportunity to succeed here at quarterback
8671626 i think we all grew up a little bit during that situation i think he did a very good job of handling a challenge handling a situation that there really wasnt a script for and was unprecedented i think it is definitely something he can learn from
8671627 its been a difficult time the last few months as far as the attention ive gotten but i think im ready for it i know its going to be amped up once the season starts im going to be definitely scrutinized but thats the job of being an nfl quarterback

8671631 engage in the types of p2p traffic management used by comcast

8671633 theyve reinforced that there remains a justification for reasonable network management
8671634 its managing the network in a fair and efficient fashion in a way that benefits the widest number of users
8671635 we think transparency is really key its good for consumers
8671636 its about giving consumers more choice and they pick the best plan
8671637 although comcasts terms of use statement may have specified that its broadband internet access service was subject to speed and upstream and downstream rate limitations such vague terms are of no practical utility to the average customer
8671638 the no 1 challenge is to make sure nobody is surprised by the new plan
8671639 wenn wir die minimale masse von galaxien kennen k nnen wir besser verstehen wie sich dunkle materie verh lt was letztlich entscheidend daf r ist die existenz des universums und unsere eigene besser zu verstehen

8671682 canada stop deporting us soldiers who refuse to fight in the illegal war in iraq
8671683 in the year that franz jagerstater was beatified by the pope in recognition of his conscientious objection and subsequent execution for refusing to serve in hitlers army it seems extraordinary that the canadian government is adopting this position these soldiers have every right to refuse to fight in an illegal war

8671690 the meltdown of progressive blogosphere 1 0 is due in large part to major a list bloggers turning a blind eye to misogyny and sexism because it helped the candidate they supported massive fail
8671691 apart from their assertion which is false that obama will end the occupation of iraq the authors make no attempt to substantiate their claim that obama represents a stark ideological contrast with mccain in fact they virtually acknowledge just the opposite
8671692 the party is worried now about mass defections by clinton supporters to john mccain well what in the hell did they expect after the may 31 charade effectively handing obama the nomination they lost what little chance they had in the fall dont expect clinton supporters to get over it any more than gore supporters when the 2000 election was stolen

8671704 foreign countries are monitoring and keeping a close watch and waiting for a showdown
8671705 we wont leave government house as ordered by the civil court
8671706 our demands remain the same to have the government resign and to prevent an amendment of the 2007 constitution
8671707 as the police have so far shown restraint and resisted efforts to disperse the crowd by force and shoulder the consequences the pad is pinning its hopes on some men in green sharing its goal of toppling the government

8671886 comparative embryology the comparative study of development can be a useful evolutionary tool because common embryological origins can be considered evidence of common descent
8671887 for example 4 week old human embryos closely resemble embryos of other vertebrates including fish with a tail and gill pouches figure 20 15
8671888 early stages if not the earliest of vertebrate embryos are more similar than later ones

8671899 parents say they treat their children equally but when you ask people they say of course there was a favourite they take it for granted
8671900 people say mum always liked her best because she looked like her or shared her interests
8671901 or my father didnt take to me because i wasnt sporty like him
8671902 but children are incredibly sensitive to parental approval and disapproval
8671903 and compare themselves to their siblings to variations in parental warmth and approval

8671921 we are trying to elaborate a strong text that will show our determination not to accept what is happening in georgia

8671923 judging by for example the number of users who downloaded our patches there were a lot more active players than there were unit sales and i think we can safely say if they were still playing the game by the time our latest patch released and if they were playing on a pirated copy then they were a sale that didnt happen but probably would have had it not been possible to obtain the game illegally

8671941 if hsu is convicted at the trial investors will likely worry about the leadership matter at the group because theres no obvious successor to him in sight
8671942 im even surprised at far eastern departments second quarter loss which is much weaker than i expected
8671943 as most investors didnt see this coming so we see short term risk on the stock especially with allegations of the chairmans bribing of the former first family

8671946 nope theres nothing wrong guys everything is ok theres nothing worry about and were still controlling 140 seats we are aware of the mandate given to us and we will strive to work harder
8671947 spent many years as a book buyer for a large book operation here in chicago i felt it was my responsibility to know my customers and their reading habits i bought for their interests not my own at times this was difficult but i also felt it was my responsibility to have a selection of books that would broaden peoples knowledge of the world ignorance is dangerous and knowledge is not for this reason it was my responsibility to stock religious books from all traditions
8671948 now i am on the other side as a sales rep for a publishing company that publishes books on spirituality and religion we are a catholic publisher but many of our books are appropriate for all christians for this reason i have noticed the religious category in many bookstores i see some stores with very good sections and others with almost no representation
8671949 if there is a religious bias by bookstore buyers in ordering religious books especially catholic books
8671950 a specialty in religion spirituality books we tend to avoid carrying stock that you could find in a cba store of which there are several in our town and instead concentrate on mainstream or liberal books dealing with christianity as well as books on other religions in terms of our personal religious beliefs were a bit of a motley crew our buying choices are a result of both what we have decided to focus on and our own principles that is books that deal with faith in an intelligent challenging and non discriminatory way
8671951 based on what will sell especially books that are geared toward the layperson we keep in some academic titles for clergy there is a seminary nearby but primarily for the layperson must be sure to carry controversial books books about atheism books about comparitive religions etc
8671952 we carry both sides of the argument but try not to promote the extremes if we can help it i just think that depending on the history of the store and the climate of the area a bookstore is going to be a place of ideas and the majority of those ideas are not going to agree on any level but isnt that the point
8671953 really only comes into play because i tend to order things that i would be interested in knowing more about i e im episcopalian and know very little about any other religions except those of the christian persuasion hence i order books that might help me learn about the other religions in the world and where they are coming from not that i eschew christian titles i guess i just order the more exotic christian titles that appeal to my sensibilities
8671954 we devote several large shelves each to every religious belief system we know of in our region christianity judaica and buddhism do very well as does some non traditional spirituality we do carry books on islamic beliefs and interest and sufism too and yes even books considered against religion as the buyer i look for small press and offbeat books in these areas as well as mainstream publisher books our philosophy section is next to religion and that does well too
8671955 we do believe gustav is going to emerge into the gulf as a major hurricane category 3 or better
8671956 it has a chance for a brief period to be a category 5
8671957 whether or not it can produce the same amount of damage as katrina or rita remains to be seen
8671958 even if youre bullish on the bond market we are at levels that do not inspire new buying
8671959 the fact that its done and over with theres a sigh of relief
8671960 as people become more health conscious you find more of this stuff in prenuptial agreements
8671961 now people want assurance that their health insurance will continue if they divorce
8671962 it turns out that a hefty 4 8 percent real growth rate was seen for real final sales in q2 with the bulk of the strength in the net export component that defies the explanations that the gain was all due to rebates the rebates likely did boost nominal consumption growth with a gain split between price gains and real growth yet q2 was clearly poised for a solid performance anyway led by trade nonresidential construction and a bounce in government spending there were all likely insensitive to the rebate program

8671997 most of the time nobody wants to hear me talk
8671998 it was certainly unlike any other game in my career
8671999 different than the other times we went to the ncaa tournament and lost but we really arent a different program than we were when the ball went up that night but the perception is dramatically changed
8672000 but that one piece that was missing at the end was the celebration that would have forever been part of the archives
8672001 the duke game gave our kids a great deal of confidence
8672002 if we can be fortunate enough to get a fourth chance i think well be even more ready
8672003 everywhere weve been weve played fast and scored a lot of points
8672004 we were in the top 25 in scoring several times at pan american players like to play that way and fans like to watch it its a good way to let your athletes show their talent
8672005 its one thing for players to say it but its another for them to do it they were very upset having had a taste of the championship game and how things could be but now its up to them to stay focused on that goal through the summer
8672006 at wagner we were pretty much last in the rpi when we got there and we were able to build a program at columbia it was almost a mirror image i might be the only coach who has ever started his career with zeros at two different jobs columbia was 0 14 in the ivy league and now were 0 29
8672007 i dont want to get where because youre an independent you cant expect to be good or expect certain things
8672008 people say youre going to have problems doing this youre going to have problems doing that its just going to be impossible
8672009 if you act like youre not supposed to be good youre not going to be good act like youre a legitimate mid major weve only been division i for two years its not like we have any fundamental problems
8672010 were not going to have to play a bunch of money games to help the athletic department
8672011 im fortunate that our ad wants us to go out and play games that make sense
8672012 the one thing i could say about the highlanders when i scouted them was even at the time when they were 0 and whatever there was some physical talent there
8672013 but they were just so young and they had issues and they turned the ball over too much and you could tell they played selfishly just by watching the tape but you knew that if they could get it together they could be a handful
8672014 we won our first game on the road at sacred heart and it was like we won the national championship
8672015 guys were hugging each other throwing things at each other ill never forget it it was a blast i know were going to have that same experience when we win our first game here hopefully its sooner rather than later
8672016 this years squad is looking to take it to the next level after a disappointing finish last year that included seven five set losses but last years team fought hard and played hard but at the same time it was very young
8672017 i get a strong sense from the team that it is ready to show people what we are really about and it expects to win a lot more matches
8672018 we can use her anywhere on the court and with her we are going to be able to advance the speed of our offense on the outside
8672019 we are going to continue to use her a lot in our offense and she is just a huge part of our success with her quickness
8672020 karyn has had her ups and downs with consistency but i have seen her grow so much since the end of last season
8672021 she has more intensity and determination than ive ever seen and i think shes going to surprise a lot of people in 2008
8672022 caroline did a phenomenal job in the middle as a freshman last season and we are looking for her to continue her blocking presence and to expand her role on offense
8672023 im excited to have meredith for the next three years as it will be great for the program
8672024 the new quicker things in our offense are going to be heavily dependent on her
8672025 she had a nice diverse offense for us in 2007
8672026 what is going to make this team achieve success this year is that we do not have one superstar that is going to get all of the sets what we do have is a solid all around cohesive team and that is what is going to make us tough to beat
8672027 she is extremely strong on defense and solid on serve and receive we will be able to do new and different things on defense because of her skills
8672028 jessie has seen a lot of action and she has one of the best hitting percentages on the team
8672029 i would like to see more kill production from her as well as keeping her hitting percentage high
8672030 jennifer has made huge contributions in the areas of defense and passing since her arrival and she has a great competitive spirit
8672031 she is an excellent all around volleyball player and her offense continues to improve each year
8672032 channing is one of the most improved players on the team because she just will not quit
8672033 she works her tail off and shes going to push for playing time i have all the confidence in the world in her to compete
8672034 it took justyna a little while to adjust to our system
8672035 but she is stronger and more determined for 2008 justyna is competitive and with her being left handed it gives us a different look and she does hit with a lot of power
8672036 ekaette has good size very good leaping ability and a fiery personality
8672037 ashleigh is going to be an exciting player for the conference with her size power and jumping ability
8672038 megan is a feisty player who brings a lot of emotion to the court and she is a solid ball control player who plays great defense
8672039 yuan can play different positions and has a lot of volleyball experience in china
8672040 she may not have a lot of power but she is smooth and diverse in her attacks
8672041 we play one of the toughest non conference schedules within conference usa and i believe that it is important for us to do
8672042 the difference is that we are going to be more ready for that level of competition this year
8672043 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page

8672072 it is the most repetitive theme of clintons political life that he always finds a path to redemption when he is down and in many ways he proved that again with this speech and he might also have accomplished something larger and less self centered by doing all he could to bring obama up at the same time
8672073 for the record i always said that bubba would bring it and tonight he did along with each of those 18 million cracks brand clinton was at stake here and hill and bill delivered the one two clinton punch that proved that their claim on the hearts and minds of the democratic party was not entirely misplaced you know just as clinton and others including me said that the campaign had strengthened obama and made him better the same can be said of the clintons the power couple that has showed its combined and individual mettle over the past few days is not the same as it would have been had they been swept smoothly back into power on a wave of inevitability obama may be the nominee for president but the clintons are back not only at the head of the democratic party but at long last back in its heart

8672076 for the vast majority of bishops it seems this has been a time when they have felt god to have been at work the conference was not a time for making new laws or for binding decisions in spite of the way some have expressed their expectations lambeth conferences have never worked straightforwardly in this way the conference design group believed strongly that the chief need of our communion at the moment was the rebuilding of relationships the rebuilding of trust in one another and of confidence in our anglican identity and it was with this in mind that they planned for a very different sort of conference determined to allow every bishops voice to be heard and to seek for a final outcome for which the bishops were genuinely able to recognize an authentic account of their own work
8672077 now we have a fresh opportunity to marvel at its magic after nine years of deciphering an anglican priest has managed to decode the personal shorthand that charles wesley used to record his diary while simultaneously keeping its contents a mystery to prying eyes
8672078 attempts to keep the most hotly anticipated consumer electronics devices under wraps these days are getting more and more futile its hard enough for companies to control disgruntled employees and leaks in the international supply chain stir in a giant government organization and things quickly unravel case in point htc dream widely believed to be the worlds first android handset after engadget loosed the dream from its fcc constraints on the 18th of august htc contacted the agency on the 19th with a request to use a less detailed diagram for the fcc label placement fortunately for us they complied giving us what can only be construed as official measurements in the process the newly unveiled 115 x 55 mm dimensions tell us that it beats the iphone 3g in terms of length and width but is almost certainly thicker than the iphone due to the dreams sliding qwerty

8672086 most people do not have an easy way to manage the vast resources of the web to simplify their task at hand for the most part they are left trundling between web sites performing common tasks resulting in frustration and wasted time
8672087 for me the web is a little bit siloed for a lot of users
8672088 there are all of these actions you normally take but you have to go all over the web to do them even something as simple as seeing something online and wanting to send it to yourself or someone else as an sms short message service right now thats a pretty painful experience lots of clicking lots of trundling
8672089 we have the rudimentary systems of structured natural language commands you can select something and ubiq command the software to translate this to french or e mail it to jono in both cases ubiquity is smart enough to realize what this and it refers to as well as knowing who jono is by talking with my web mails contact list
8672090 its also smart enough to be able to understand commands like map chicago comics and yelp tapas near sf and give you rich previews and search results to get you where you want to be quickly even better both of those commands let you insert results directly into say an e mail youre writing so that you never have to interrupt your chain of thought
8672091 its not yet there but it is targeted for everyone to be able to use it right now ubiquity is a 0 1 alpha prototype experiment that isnt ready for everyone

8672103 could bunyan quote from an ancient latin author living near carthage
8672104 stop that is another matter bunyan might use a phrase of augustines for two reasons first although he had not read augustine he must have read scores of puritan theologians who had and second he was so eager on the same problems of grace and predestination that he may have naturally come to the same cross roads of controversy

8672111 weve got to get out of the habit of thinking that we only need to focus on improving the technology that we can invent our way out of this situation

8672115 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
8672116 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
8672117 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

8672119 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
8672120 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
8672121 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
8672122 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
8672123 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
8672124 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
8672125 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
8672126 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
8672127 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
8672128 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
8672129 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
8672130 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
8672131 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
8672132 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

8672139 speaker pelosis outrageous attempt to present what she considers the teaching of the catholic church regarding abortion is simply wrong and should be disregarded by every faithful catholic
8672140 the teachings of the church on abortion are consistent and unambiguous and it is very disturbing to hear someone who claims to be a catholic distort these teachings and sow seeds of confusion among the faithful by attempting to relativize the right to life
8672141 house speaker nancy pelosi stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion

8672143 describe how to determine the height of a tall building with a barometer
8672144 you tie a long piece of string to the neck of the barometer then lower the barometer from the roof of the building to the ground the length of the string plus the length of the barometer will equal the height of the building
8672145 firstly you could take the barometer up to the roof of the building drop it over the edge and measure the time it takes to reach the ground the height of the building can then be worked out from the formula h 0 5g x t squared but bad luck for the barometer

8672147 andy is such a perfectionist and he is probably finding all this very frustrating he just has to concentrate on his own performance now and get the job done
8672148 good murray is under control again llodra has given his all i think and andy should finish him here
8672149 it has turned into an erratic match both players have had their moments but on the whole it has not been particularly pretty
8672150 murray seems to have steadied the ship a little but he is still far from looking like a number six seed
8672151 we were hoping murray would be in command by now but instead we are dead level
8672152 murray wont lose he just has to wake up and i think he is starting to get into the game now
8672153 thats the sampras way get a routine first set then introduce some drama by inexplicably capitulating in the second no wait
8672154 murrays second serve are nowhere near good enough level at this level and they will be punished they seem to be getting shorter and shorter too
8672155 murray looks a little bit too patient and passive at the moment llodra looks composed and confident these are alarming moments for the sixth seed
8672156 murray has got to dig a little deeper that first set was so controlled he though he could come out and pick up where he left off but llodra is too good a player
8672157 murray does not want to try to be too clever the intensity wasnt there for him in that game that should be a wake up call for him
8672158 thats the sampras way get the early break and hold hold hold till you win the set good start now sustain it
8672159 only the single break but it was all he needed murray takes the first set and he has barely broken sweat
8672160 not much drama in this match so far it has been more about mistakes than winners
8672161 murray will be very happy sitting back on the baseline playing rallies because he knows he will come out on top in most of them
8672162 you have to hope this is going to be straightforward for murray anything more than three sets is wasted energy hopefully hell put llodra away quickly

8672263 i suspect that human dignity is not a metaphysical property of individual humans but rather a property of relationships between humans between so to speak the dignifier and the dignified to put it another way human dignity designates a way of being human not a property of being human
8672264 god did not create man as a solitary for from the beginning male and female he created them their companionship produces the primary form of interpersonal communion for by his innermost nature man is a social being and unless he relates himself to others he can neither live nor develop his potential
8672265 what we need for a theistic grounding of human rights
8672266 instead of beginning with a metaphysical theory of subjectivity identifying subjectivity with human dignity and using that to explain why humiliating people violates human dignity i am proposing that we begin with the proposition that humiliating people denies their human dignity we then explain what human dignity is by trying to isolate characteristic features of humiliation in this case treating a persons story and viewpoint as significant
8672267 if dignity is a matter of what one is rather than does then someone with little free choice could still enjoy dignity or suffer indignities a prisoner of war although having few opportunities for autonomous action can nevertheless carry himself and deserves to be treated with great dignity

8672356 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8672357 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves

8672391 we have done everything we can to support the airline and left no stone unturned to secure a re financing package that would have kept our aircraft flying even as late as yesterday we had secured a new investment package but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying

8672393 the price of oil resulted in our fuel bill jumping by nearly 50 million in one year and we could not recover that from passengers who had already booked their flights
8672394 there are a number of ground support agencies and services as well as the airport authority that are owed some funds from zoom so the aircraft is on the ground in calgary pending resolution with zoom and the leaseholder as well as the creditors

8672473 a policy of casualty aversion in israel or in the united states results in more casualties in the end
8672474 israelis have compounded their mistakes with an airpower based strategy that whatever its virtues in keeping israeli troops out of harms way was never going to evict hezbollah from southern lebanon just as airpower alone did not evict saddam from kuwait in 1991
8672475 created a monolithic establishment lacking the motivation for developing brilliantly innovative methods of warfare
8672476 the lack of clear decisions was manifested in the failure to act the non implementation of operational plans and the cancellation in the midst of combat of missions assigned to the unit the result was that the unit was deployed too long in hostile country without any operational purpose and was held back from making contact with the enemy
8672477 this last disastrous order released the welter of conflicting incomprehensible orders which stirred up the entire chain of command from the heads of the idfs northern command down to the officers in the field operational orders designed to meet tactical combat situations were scrapped in mid execution and new directives tumbled down the chute from above soldiers later complained that in one day they were jerked into unreasoned actions by four to six contrary instructions
8672478 the idf was not prepared for the war in lebanon
8672479 hezbollah has demonstrated that total arab defeat is not inevitable and with this demonstration israel has lost its tremendous psychological advantage
8672480 israel cannot survive in this region and cannot live in it in peace or at least non war unless people in israel itself and in its surroundings believe that israel has the political and military leadership military capabilities and social robustness that will allow her to deter those of its neighbors who wish to harm her and to prevent them if necessary through the use of military force from achieving their goal

8672509 current drugs given to people with lewy body and parkinsons disease simply treat the symptoms this model is the first platform to understand how the brain cell deterioration takes place we will use this model to identify targets for new drugs to slow or prevent the disease
8672510 the formation of lewy bodies is a key event in the development of nerve cell death associated with parkinsons disease understanding how these are formed will help us to figure out what happens when nerve cells die in parkinsons and from this to develop therapies that will ultimately provide a cure for the condition
8672511 universities in the midlands continue to set the bar in innovation and discovery

8672513 these results showing the beneficial impact of alpharadin in terms of pain palliation are important as improved quality of life alongside increased survival are the two key goals of anti cancer therapy of patients with skeletal metastases
8672514 these results build on the positive phase ii clinical data package that we have already assembled with alpharadin the highlight of which was the significant survival benefits that we have already reported in patients with hrpc based on our clinical trials to date i am very confident that alpharadin has the potential to become an important new therapy for patients with prostate cancer this view has been reinforced by the enthusiastic and positive response we have received from key opinion leaders around the world to our unique approach to treating hrpc

8672526 we believe the province could turn over to iraqi control in just a few days
8672527 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
8672528 anbar remains a dangerous place but the ever growing ability of the iraqi security forces continues to move us closer to seeing iraqi control of the province
8672529 however in order to do more in afghanistan our marines have got to see relief elsewhere
8672530 they are doing a very good job of this nation building business
8672531 25 000 marines in the province are probably being in excess of the need especially after iraqi provincial control assumes responsibilities for security
8672532 its our view that if there is a stiffer fight going someplace else in a much more expeditionary environment where the marine air ground task force really seems to have a true and enduring value then thats where we need to be
8672533 according to my vote all of this area is indigenous
8672534 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8672535 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8672536 the difference between a weed and a flower is a polls archive
8672537 they all seem to be taking some care to be ecumenical
8672538 gorki aguila has not committed any specific crime as defined by the current criminal code
8672539 these kinds of trials are very biased its difficult for someone to be absolved
8672540 a lawyer can do very little because theres no evidence of criminal activity presented only what the police say
8672541 weve finished our new album we dont know if this is because of that or if it could be something thats been cooking for months
8672542 to affirm that there is an absolute constitutional protection of life in gestation would lead to the violation of the fundamental rights of women

8672546 it was good but you had to be better than they were and we were pretty much the same
8672547 at my age id have to be signed on a pro contract like michael owen and all that so i had to be outstanding i went to leeds united a couple of weeks after that and was easily at their level but didnt get a clearance for the reserve team game they wanted me to play so it didnt work out
8672548 effectively the nzru will be paying for the players payments
8672549 if we didnt they would not have been able to carry on and we would have been up for that amount to pay the players anyway
8672550 we dont want the competition to be disrupted and tasman if it withdrew could have impacted on other provincial unions
8672551 we are seeking further information before we think about challenging the nzru
8672552 the worry for the ratepayer is if theyre left with over priced land

8672562 con edison is committed to reducing its carbon foot print by using hybrid vehicles and other innovative transportation technologies
8672563 part of our strategy is to steadily replace our trucks with technology such as azures reducing our dependency on petroleum based fuels improving new yorks air quality and meeting the challenges associated with climate change

8672565 the establishment of the global hybrid center at mftbc shows the increasing focus of daimler trucks and mitsubishi fuso on developing hybrid commercial vehicles
8672566 we believe the market for hybrids will expand more rapidly in the future given the need to further reduce vehicle emissions as well as fuel consumption the new center will concentrate our efforts in developing clean efficient hybrid commercial vehicles to meet market needs now and in the future

8672574 increasing their numbers of highly committed customers by delivering positive service experiences can be very rewarding to auto insurers and significantly impact their financial returns
8672575 in an industry where a one percent shift in total market share can amount to a 1 6 billion dollar shift in premiums enhancing the customer experience to gain highly committed customers is absolutely critical to auto insurers
8672576 the very nature of the auto insurance market requires continuous improvements in order to keep pace with ever increasing customer expectations
8672577 proactive outbound communications greatly improve the customer experience as the more engaged auto insurers are the more satisfied customers become
8672578 implementing various key practices such as resolving issues on the first contact offering annual policy reviews providing online access to policy information and increasing customer awareness of policy discounts can also greatly impact satisfaction and enhance the overall experience
8672579 one of the constant themes that comes through loud and clear from the people of north wales is that they want to see police officers out on the beat in their communities
8672580 new technology can help us make the best possible use of our officers so that they spend as little time as possible on paper work back at the station
8672581 it is vital that our officers are spending as little time as necessary locked away in a police station behind a desk and as much time as possible out in the street in contact with the public
8672582 one of the things that we are doing and we are leading the service in this is making better use of modern technology to cut down on that bureaucratic load traditionally undertaken in the police station
8672583 we can look at every photograph ever taken of anybody who has come into contact with the police
8672584 we have actually been able to separate twin brothers by their tattoos in a photograph on a blackberry
8672585 it is a phenomenally powerful tool and the great difference here in north wales is that every officer has got one already
8672586 crisis management is the only strategy that i am able to apply
8672587 we have to go to the israelis to get permission to do projects like drilling building reservoirs or laying pipes
8672588 we are all suffering from climate change in the region israel and jordan are also affected
8672589 but we suffer the worst because we dont have control over our own resources
8672590 we conducted emergency water trucking for 10 communities in southern hebron
8672591 we are supporting a plan where the idea is to increase the number of israelis in the workforce
8672592 we want to create a situation where there is no interest in hiring palestinian workers instead of israeli ones
8672593 in my opinion this will likely extend to other sectors as well not just construction

8672595 these data demonstrate that treatment with velcade plus melphalan and prednisone leads to a survival benefit and a high complete remission in previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma
8672596 the combination of velcade plus melphalan and prednisone is an important new option for these patients
8672597 we are proud to have these data published in such a highly esteemed journal
8672598 were delighted that previously untreated multiple myeloma patients now can benefit from this velcade based therapy as have patients in the relapsed and refractory settings since 2003
8672599 the tolerability of vcmp also was encouraging and side effects were generally manageable with appropriate supportive care and dose reduction as needed
8672600 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8672601 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8672602 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8672603 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8672604 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8672605 this is a substantial breakthrough in maternal fetal medicine that could positively impact the health of thousands of babies
8672606 after 10 years of studying the effects of magnesium sulfate it has proven to be a successful method of reducing the outcome of cerebral palsy in premature births
8672607 based on results of the study in the future it is possible that women at risk of prematurely giving birth could proactively receive magnesium sulfate to reduce their childs chances of developing cerebral palsy
8672608 with additional research it is possible that in the next few years this will be a standard of care

8672611 hes going to be talking directly to his opponent so im going to leave it there but its going be very exciting i think that a lot of people are going to focus on it
8672612 words that work and words that dont a guide for counterterrorism communication
8672613 glamorize terrorism imbues terrorists with religious authority they do not have and damages relations with muslims around the world
8672614 we must carefully avoid giving bin laden and other al qaeda leaders the legitimacy they crave by characterizing them as religious figures or in terms that may make them seem to be noble in the eyes of some
8672615 democracies must never give in to violence and terrorists must never be rewarded for using it negotiations give legitimacy to terrorists and their methods undermine actors who have pursued political change through peaceful means talks can destabilize the negotiating governments political systems and undercut international efforts to outlaw terrorism
8672616 our enemies are little worms i saw them at munich
8672617 we must never become victims of our own myths and see our opponents through a distorting ethnocentric lens we would do better if we educated our policymakers and military leaders more thoroughly to be wary of simple answers and to be more alert to the diverse character of the worlds peoples and the complexities of their problems
8672618 in the future israel and palestine will be one united state in which israelis and palestinians will live together
8672619 whatever territory israel was prepared or compelled to cede and use it as a springboard for further territorial gains until achieving the complete liberation of palestine
8672620 may this be only one step in the liberation of all of palestine
8672621 the painful and qualitative blows which the palestinian resistance dealt to the jews and their soldiers over the past four and a half years led to the decision to withdraw from the gaza strip
8672622 the withdrawal marks the end of the zionist dream and is a sign of the moral and psychological decline of the jewish state
8672623 i believe that we face adversaries who are much cleverer than we are adversaries who know that they have to proceed in stages as far as they are concerned things are entirely clear they dont want us here but in the meantime they are prepared to make do with whatever they can get at each stage that moves them closer to their ultimate objective
8672624 in diplomacy no less than in war deception works because those being deceived prefer to live within the deception rather than to acknowledge the sobering facts staring them in the face and thereby to accept the frightening responsibility of having to act to address and reverse them

8672631 the freedom of speech and press protections guaranteed by both the united states and new york constitutions
8672632 received a message from someone who helps distribute such books in britain
8672633 can you please let us know if there are any references to saudis and terrorist s in the book we are just concerned that this book could potentially create libel lawsuits as it could offend saudis living in england

8672635 if they had been israeli bullets they would be very strange bullets because they would have needed to go around the corner
8672636 when you look at the scene things could have been much worse
8672637 right now were trying to gather that information weve got to put the puzzle together
8672638 the probative evidence shows that the respondents have violated the georgia open meetings act have violated the boards code of ethics for board members and have engaged in conduct unbecoming of a board member and in breach of the public trust
8672639 the evidence as the judge pointed out was so overwhelming that it would have been a shock had he not ruled the way he did
8672640 we are not surprised by the decision we could tell what the outcome was going to be from the very beginning and it was continually reaffirmed throughout
8672641 they wanted us off the board and theyre getting what they want
8672642 political reasons or whatever the taxpayers and the children are the ones who will suffer because i tried to do the best i could
8672643 its just a new way of doing business thats all
8672644 if i have to be the martyr and save those kids and save their accreditation then fine
8672645 the inability of the board to function properly during this critical period of sacs accreditation issues constitutes a breach of the public trust of the board
8672646 even the administrative judge acknowledges the board of the last few months is a very different board
8672647 based on all the work thats been done we should maintain our accreditation we did everything they asked us to do
8672648 ive just agreed to write a movie for sony and producer scott rudin about how facebook was invented
8672649 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8672650 this represents a major step forward in our understanding of the dry form of macular degeneration
8672651 and with the identification of this potential target we can try to develop treatments for a disease which for the moment we cant treat
8672652 this raises particular concerns regarding rnai therapy for wet amd
8672653 but by establishing this link between the treatment for the wet form of amd and the potential harmful effect on the dry form of the disease we can perhaps better understand the mechanisms of both diseases
8672654 i think these results have to be taken with caution because the association effect of tlr3 with amd is very small when compared to the diseases association with some other genes
8672655 and there has been already one study saying there is absolutely no association of the tlr3 genetic variant with amd so this raises a question and a need for further edification it could be that this is just a spurious finding and there is in fact no association with amd
8672656 the amethyst initiative is not a call for policy change
8672657 it is a compelling call for dialogue because too many of americas young people are losing their lives ruining their lives or not living up to their full potential and the common cause is alcohol abuse
8672658 drinking that requires one to find a dark corner or travel to a remote location is drinking that puts not only the drinker but also the innocent citizen at greater risk
8672659 right now law abiding parents dont let their kids drink around them so they cant drink openly until they go away to college thats when they binge drink
8672660 statistics show that raising the drinking age has saved about 25 000 lives since it was passed in 1984
8672661 you may not have a class until 11 a m so you dont have responsibilities very early in the day you dont go out and binge drink if you have to work or do something early in the morning
8672662 in college we set up the environment for binge drinking
8672663 the impact is so far reaching we thought we had a quiet community
8672664 now its not unusual to drive through this community and see a kill duncan bumper sticker on a nice car i can never even guess the reach of the effect on this community by this killer
8672665 our children are our most precious gift on this planet
8672666 to have that innocence ripped away from a child is unacceptable every child should be allowed to be a child
8672667 is a little bit of relief shasta will have some closure and justice will be done for her family when he receives the death penalty
8672668 ms martinez deserves that closure just as much as any other mother until there is closure for those families for me its not over yet
8672669 we know he was stalking this family he was hanging out at playgrounds
8672670 all you can do is take that information and protect your children and the children of neighbors
8672671 i havent been this jacked up in a long time
8672672 its like ive been locked up in a prison and my heart and mind have been locked up when this verdict was released it flowed out of me tears flowed of me
8672673 they were going to get married in a few months
8672674 the healing will never come for me or the rest of the mckenzie family
8672675 this trial has been awful rough on all of us
8672676 now weve just got to get on with our lives
8672677 tragedy is not really an adequate word to describe this
8672678 im scared for her to go to public school im scared for her to say hi to people in the supermarket
8672679 you are not going to take our children and kill our families we will hunt you down and find you
8672680 the whole family and especially steve has appreciated the prayers and wishes of the public
8672681 i expected this whole thing to be settled some time in 2006
8672682 i think this is a good first step hopefully he will never return
8672683 by his just laying down one wonders if this was the result duncan wanted
8672684 its just pure relief im sure mark is looking down and cheering just like we are
8672685 if he had the chance hed drink a beer both he and brenda would
8672686 an incomplete story referencing apple inc was inadvertently published by bloomberg news at 4 27 p m new york time today the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted
8672687 to be blunt about it is that apple simply cant be trusted to tell truth about its chief executive under mr jobs apple has created a culture of secrecy that has served it well in many ways
8672688 you think im an arrogant expletive who thinks hes above the law and i think youre a slime bucket who gets most of his facts wrong
8672689 because the conversation was off the record i cannot disclose what mr

8672707 eu estou muito feliz por estar de volta mal consigo esperar a chance de come ar de novo
8672708 i am not surprised that conventional financing is down as significantly as it is fannie and freddie have started to charge significantly more for lower credit scores not bad credit just lower scores it does not take much to figure out they are simply profiteering off the consumer lenders will send buyers to fha loans when they make more sense fannie and freddie must not realize buyers do have choices they are getting less market share based on their tactics as far as dpa goes the new bill even if it does pass wont make much difference if the investors who buy fha loans decide not to buy them with dpa which we are starting to see much work to be done before this all settles out
8672709 the money is clean and there was absolutely no corruption
8672710 this agreement in fact represents successful completion of two landmark m amp a transactions in russian retail merger between perekrestok and pyaterochka and acquisition of karusel by x5 which resulted in creation of a full scale multi format russian retailer and an unrivalled leader in the sector
8672711 its core customers want to be cool wearing brands that represent the heroes they aspire to be
8672712 at the same time those cool kids want to be viewed as unique
8672713 craft a story of female ambition creativity talent and growth
8672714 i wanted to have something to talk about at trade shows with buyers
8672715 neither sen barack obama nor sen hillary rodham clinton has any possible sane rational reason for wanting tensions to continue
8672716 for the next two days a convention that belongs to obama will be dominated by the same two people who dominated the democratic party for the last generation and who have come to denver in much different roles than they wanted
8672717 clinton watching has become the mesmerizing sideshow of the democratic national convention that will nominate barack obama
8672718 obamas decision to pass her over for vice president remains central to the ongoing story of their strained relationship it has also contributed to what associates say has been a difficult emotional period for the former first lady in the two months since ending her bid
8672719 as a person who experienced a flooded house submerged car this very week
8672720 they fulfill their own storylines by f ing everything up and pointing and blaming it on
8672721 as you well know anytime you try to change things in baseball its both emotional and difficult but this decision everyone really thought was in the sports best interest and thats why i made it
8672722 following the world series the players will review the matter and then determine what course to take for the future
8672723 while the use of instant replay is an experiment we hope that over the balance of this season it will prove to be a success
8672724 as you well know anytime you try to change things in baseball its both emotional and difficult but this decision everyone really thought was in the sports best interest and thats why i made it
8672725 you have to feel sorry for bate they are quite literally dead
8672726 the tuskarr are a kind natured nomadic race that roams the southern coastlines of northrend guided by the carved cyclopean statues that mark their seasonal fishing routes the tuskarrs tribal affiliation is evidenced by the sigils inscribed on their tusks and although they are a peaceful race they are constantly beset by the kvaldir and an arctic race of murloc like creatures known as the gorloc
8672727 what does a day in the life of a social media marketer look like
8672728 while chris leaves out some aspects of monitoring social media theres no way you could fit all of it into one example chris post is an excellent starting point to get you thinking
8672729 something for everyone lots of food on a stick odorous livestock buildings beer concerts contests free stuff and carnival rides that make you sick what could be better there is so much to see and do for the whole family that i could never do it justice

8672733 i highly recommend the state fair of texas for anyone who is either visiting dallas or who lives in the area there are all sorts of things to do for people of all ages there are concerts livestock shows demonstrations exhibits and of course food one of the most popular areas is the auto show where all the new cars are displayed in a salesman free environment
8672734 while i dont go to fairs every year i did enjoy myself at this one especially the good food that was available there was a rodeo four entertainment stages livestock shows and auctions a 10 acre midway and every type of food you can think of 4h and ffa students spend the whole year getting their animals ready for judging here and many schools close for at least one fair day
8672735 we must keep working to further and further reduce accidents until everyone goes home uninjured
8672736 our challenge is to keep this up through this year and into next year in this way we will continue to get the support we need to move the mine forward

8672751 its certainly been a difficult year but buying out a partner is never an easy thing
8672752 hes a former marine and great guy and hes older than i am so that might work
8672753 about 10 years ago i thought i wont see this what to say except oh hallelujah
8672754 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8672755 knew the truth from the very beginning they lied about it they hid the truth from their neighbors
8672756 monsanto studies showed that dioxin the main ingredient in agent orange was not a human carcinogen
8672757 if they were done correctly the studies would have reached just the opposite result
8672758 the tested doses were well below those which people normally use
8672759 instead of siding with the people who were being poisoned the government sided with the company it was outrageous
8672760 there was no investigation of monsanto what they investigated was cate jenkins the whistleblower they made her life a hell
8672761 they figured well if youre in the way well get you out of the way one day i was escorted to the door and told that was it i was done
8672762 i have never seen a situation where one company could have so much overwhelming influence at the highest levels of regulatory decision making
8672763 call me were in the de reg business maybe we can help
8672764 there was a general feeling in agro business and inside our government in the us that if you werent marching lock step forward in favor of rapid approvals of biotech products rapid approvals of gmo crops then somehow you were anti science and anti progress
8672765 when i opened my mouth in the clinton administration about the lax regulations on gmos i got slapped around a little bit
8672766 two phone calls from downing street the home of uk prime minister tony blair to the director
8672767 theres no ethics at all in whats going on here it shows an organization that is determined to push its products into countries around the world and its determined to destroy the reputation of anybody who stands in their way
8672768 if we dont manage to stop their spread in our fields soon well be forced to buy our corn seed because our own wont work anymore
8672769 it is possible that monsanto lets say promoted its varieties and its seeds
8672770 we had to authorize gmo seeds because they had already entered our country in an lets say unorthodox way
8672771 created a little industry that serves no other purpose than to wreck farmers lives
8672772 there was no non bt hybrid seed available in the market
8672773 they are in the process of owning food all food
8672774 its objective is to control all of the worlds food production
8672775 if they control seed they control food they know it its strategic its more powerful than bombs its more powerful than guns this is the best way to control the populations of the world
8672776 if you are visiting with us today you are not only welcome to participate you are urged to if you were at my house and it came dinnertime i wouldnt leave you sitting in the other room while i went to the dining room
8672777 you may cutoff both my arms and let my blood spill to the ground but you will not defile the table of the lord
8672778 but if we judge ourselves rightly we would not be judged
8672779 if anyone is hungry let him eat at home so that you will not come together for judgment

8672784 what the surprising strength of the u s dollar is doing to mortgage rates
8672785 this affair brings to mind former philippine president ferdinand marcos
8672786 i had to be consistent and try to get a high percentage of my first serves in
8672787 i didnt return so well and i had a lot of ups and downs and big frustrations
8672788 but it is the first match it is always the trickiest one but hopefully the next one will be better
8672789 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8672790 the most important thing is to stay positive in the difficult moments in the match even when you feel tired
8672791 when i got into a dangerous situation i started moving her around a little bit more in the second set i was able to gain more confidence
8672792 we knew it was a difficult team to play against
8672793 they played good on counterattack it was difficult but we were playing better than in the first leg
8672794 this is what keeps us on the road 70 percent of the time
8672795 we see different reactors in different conditions and we know this removal has to be done very fast we dont want to give more time to people who are preparing to steal this material
8672796 that was a big challenge from the security point of view and from the point of view of keeping it secret
8672797 but we had a constant exchange of information with the bulgarian security services
8672798 it looks just like any other barge business as usual on the danube
8672799 we are very concerned about this material we take this threat to be very real the information that we have lets us know we have to act as aggressively as possible to remove this material
8672800 even if you think that there is a 1 percent or half percent chance of there being such a catastrophic event its probably worth taking a lot more precautions than we are at the moment
8672801 if people insist on the same standards for radioactivity we have now we would have to give up large areas of the city people would ultimately have to get used to the risk of going back to a slightly contaminated part of london
8672802 i really dont know why an attack hasnt happened already
8672803 he said he was very proud of what we had done and invited us to come to the kremlin
8672804 russians care about football and given the great wealth there i would expect this to become permanent
8672805 russia is much more confident now and it wants to be taken seriously as a global actor and sport is part of its projection as a major actor
8672806 its up to us to put our hands up and perform well and basically if they play good cricket we have to match it
8672807 theyve done it before so yeah weve got to go out and play well
8672808 were off a break were i guess under a bit of pressure and its up to these guys now
8672809 its up to us to put our hands up and perform well and basically if they play good cricket we have to match it
8672810 the australian a team said it swung up here a bit early in the morning
8672811 so hopefully it we get the chance to bowl early we can utilize that and it would actually give me more of a chance to get a few early wickets and hopefully just bowl well

8672813 this concern centres on the argument that the parties have strong market positions in respect of rights over uk tv content and that uk tv content is unique both of these propositions are misconceived
8672814 it cannot be doubted that players such as nsdq amzn microsoft and sony have the know how and resources to make highly competitive offers for vod rights if they should wish to do so independent production companies such as endemol are large and sophisticated organisations that are perfectly capable of taking advantage of commercial opportunities by separating linear and vod rights
8672815 today we have 7 500 hours one of the largest portfolios out there wed love to have more but our success or failure will not be dictated by signing another deal

8672824 i cannot imagine a better way than for senator clinton herself to be the one to declare him to be the nominee by acclamation it was incredibly dramatic
8672825 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate
8672826 it is with great pride that i announce barack obama is the democratic nominee for president of the united states by acclamation
8672827 i cannot imagine a better way than for senator clinton herself to be the one to declare him to be the nominee by acclamation
8672828 it was incredibly dramatic and the effect it had on many delegates was absolutely wonderful
8672829 i think it was absolutely the right thing to do it showed a lot of class on her part
8672830 were always a party of very cantankerous people but were more united than ive ever seen it
8672831 from thursday im an obama person today i cast my vote for hillary clinton as that was the mandate i was given by my state
8672832 she has unified us and now it is up to him to close the deal he has to take her message to the hinterland small towns in alabama he has to carry that message to them

8672834 he means so much for the club and for the supporters
8672835 his contract is until 10 january and we let his agent know a couple of days ago that we are not thinking of selling him
8672836 our hope is that larsson will continue at helsingborg even next year
8672837 i dont know what is happening at everton actually there might be a slight problem between david moyes and his president regarding the signing and im also aware of the fact that newcastle want him as well
8672838 europa muss einig sein aber es darf den russen nicht drohen
8672839 its inappropriate to comment on what is going on behind the scenes at the moment
8672840 were working on it but ive been doing transfers for many many years and know nothing is done until its done either in or out
8672841 well see what happens but unfortunately everybody is going to have to wait
8672842 it is a shame that we have lost damien duff for the two opening qualifiers
8672843 he started very well and he is a very important player in the irish squad
8672844 i am happy that fifa and the georgian football federation have made a decision to play the game against georgia in a neutral venue
8672845 we understand that it was a difficult decision to make but feel it was the correct one given the need to prioritise the safety of the players and fans

8672873 shortly after moving to powys our friends in london would say whats it like where you live
8672874 we would say its horrible stay away because we didnt want anyone to know how peaceful and relaxing it was in comparison to the rat race in london
8672875 that was 30 years ago but the pace of life hasnt altered a great deal since then
8672876 sometimes the lifestyle makes us laugh especially when people born and bred in the county take things for granted
8672877 for instance i remember being with a farmer one day and i was seeing these wonderful views for the first time i was amazed but all the farmer was concerned about was whether his tractor radio could receive radio 1
8672878 people from outside the area see powys as a rural idyll but if theyre not prepared to sacrifice a few things then they can learn to dislike their new home
8672879 we know a couple who moved to powys because they wanted to escape the rat race but the woman in the relationship couldnt drive and she eventually hated the area
8672880 but in some ways the drawbacks add to the areas charm and thats why some people move here
8672881 for example i recently saw two old women clapping and mouthing well done as a police car drove through llanfair it was hilarious but charming at the same time can you imagine that happening in cardiff or birmingham
8672882 i would never go back to living in the south east of england its over crowded and a stressful place
8672883 for instance if i forget to lock my car at night it doesnt bother me because i know it will be there in the morning
8672884 powys has some of the lowest crimes rates in the uk and that gives us peace of mind
8672885 everybody knows each other and its such a friendly place a five minute trip to the shops can turn into 20 minutes when you stop and chat

8672887 there are plenty of mothers who arent very well educated who provide a great home environment and conversely some highly educated parents who dont provide such a good home environment
8672888 what parents do is important irrespective of their own education
8672889 its not just middle class children who do lots of reading
8672890 the preschool experiences both at home and in the preschool itself had consequences for longer term development in maths achievement age 10
8672891 this is the first study which demonstrates preschool effects that are long term in nature for the general population
8672892 clearly if you want to maximise the achievement of your population you should provide a high level of preschool education
8672893 the politburo in china are not doing this for the love of the little kiddies they are doing this because they recognise that it is an essential part of the infrastructure for a successful economy in the modern world
8672894 supplementary grant are being paid to me in 3 installments on 08 09 2008 05 01 2009 20 04 2009
8672895 lets just say im glad that sampras is on my team
8672896 its easy to say yes to this kind of thing to get together with a very small group of people who you have mutual respect for because of what we were able to accomplish there are not a lot of people who can say that
8672897 im delighted to play with these guys once again and to play with john everyone knows the matches we had in the past
8672898 i rode work for the first time yesterday and it felt good
8672899 next wednesday is six weeks the recommended time and i would expect with a bit of luck to be back riding possibly a few days before the galway three day meeting which starts on monday september 8
8672900 its been very frustrating and in hindsight i probably didnt give it enough time but the x rays look good now and the surgeon is happy with how the healing process has gone in recent weeks

8672907 kinsella is a modern day machiavelli the mastermind who ran war rooms for jean chretien and dalton mcguinty hes the ultimate political insider the war room has plenty of fascinating insights and is a must read for political junkies
8672908 warren kinsellas new book is a must read for anyone interested in political campaigning in canada and not just political campaigning i wish id had the chance to read the war room before i became stephen harpers campaign manager it might have saved me from many mistakes and months of painful learning on the job
8672909 the war room is a rich detailed and substantive primer on how to run a winning war room warts pizza boxes smelly couches and all from a master war roomer
8672910 kinsella has crafted a handy little guide for politicos and non politicos alike just keep it away from the kids
8672911 i dont want to say hes a genius but theres valuable insights here
8672912 i just got one copy but i plan to get more
8672913 hes canadas james carville a must read if you really want to win you need this book
8672914 you are talking about blood money this is not a legitimate business or legitimate money he is selling the guns to the underworld just to kill people and its all because of greed
8672915 i think he is as guilty as the people who are using the gun
8672916 the factory that made the gun has now been sealed off a lot of guns are traced to that factory we are pleased he has finally been brought to justice
8672917 i am begging them in the name of god for the love of this country for the peace of this country to please come forward and speak to the police
8672918 the police cant work in isolation the public have to work with the police they have to start trusting the police
8672919 life will never be the same again i am bleeding from my heart the pain is just unbearable
8672920 we have got so much pain in our hearts the only way we can carry on is to forgive the killers but it has been very difficult
8672921 how many electronic products can really be launched every day and would we get the youth
8672922 i have never heard something so shocking in all my life to describe it as the next hillsborough is to completely miss the point
8672923 the only time there was severe crushing was on the wednesday when the tickets went on sale
8672924 during the weekend there will always be bands that are more popular and therefore more people want to see them which is why the nme radio 1 tent was 15 per cent bigger and i installed a secondary barrier which pushes back the crowd from the densely populated area near the front
8672925 hillsborough was when thousands and thousands of people were trapped and reading is nothing like that
8672926 i had crowd control i had security on all pressure points where the barriers were and a main entrance and exit into the arena
8672927 i moved the alternative stage and the festival republic stage into another field because of the sound overlapping from the main stage which actually created 20 per cent more space in the arena
8672928 what needs to be born in mind with all these dreadful shootings taking place is none of those murders happened in the thames valley so there was no investigation going on
8672929 whether other inquiries would have led to the discovery of the factory is down to speculation certainly the public gave us a breakthrough and we soon realised the enormity of scale of the criminal activity
8672930 it is difficult to say if this factory would not have been found but the indication from our inquiries was the activities at the briars had tailed off significantly up to the find
8672931 why that was is not overly clear but i suspect he had run out of weapons to convert and changes in legislation had made it more difficult to manufacture these guns and ammunition
8672932 the impact that this criminal activity has had has been absolutely dreadful there have been numerous murder victims people have been shot and guns discharged
8672933 our forensic analysis identifies in 90 per cent of shootings involving mac 10 seizures the guns came from this factory
8672934 if you are involved in making sub machine guns that have no other use than killing people and you are making massive amounts of ammunition they can only be supplied to criminals they cant have any other use
8672935 nhs berkshire west had already adopted an interim position of funding treatment for patients who were clinically prioritised by consultants as needing lucentis to treat age related macular degeneration
8672936 we will be updating our policy in line with the new nice guidance
8672937 i am just so relieved i have had seven injections now and although the later ones have been funded there was never a guarantee and the pct could have pulled the funding at any minute
8672938 now i can rest assured that my treatment is paid for and it is wonderful news especially for people in other areas who are currently paying for lucentis
8672939 if you are given the choice of losing your sight in a matter of weeks or stumping up a few thousand pounds for an injection of course you will find the money if you can but now there will be no need it is fantastic news
8672940 it is great news for people across the country that all pcts will now have to follow in the same footsteps as berkshire west
8672941 berkshire west although slow initially were one of the first to pay for lucentis for eligible patients back in december but it is reassuring to know that now other patients suffering from amd will get the treatment they deserve
8672942 what is important now is raising awareness of amd and making sure that elderly people visit their gp or optician at the first sign of anything going wrong
8672943 too many people go half blind silently because they do not get their eyes looked at the quicker you get treated the more sight you can have restored and the less sight you lose
8672944 everything from regular check ups to eating healthily can help
8672945 its hard to maintain reality when all around you its denied
8672946 the only people that win in this situation are those who point and laugh
8672947 but then the batshit crazy came and made everything hilarious
8672948 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
8672949 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
8672950 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
8672951 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
8672952 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
8672953 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
8672954 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
8672955 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
8672956 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
8672957 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
8672958 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
8672959 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
8672960 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
8672961 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
8672962 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
8672963 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
8672964 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
8672965 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
8672966 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
8672967 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
8672968 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
8672969 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
8672970 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
8672971 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
8672972 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
8672973 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
8672974 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
8672975 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
8672976 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
8672977 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
8672978 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
8672979 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
8672980 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
8672981 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
8672982 both clubs will be trying to get a leg up and wanting to talk to players
8672983 weve got a timetable in place to talk to players and if we can get things done by the end of december thats great
8672984 things like this can be distracting so we want the players to focus on the season but we can spread out discussions so its handled properly
8672985 we have had to spread our limited resources too thinly across too many sports
8672986 i am sure that many will now call for the government to substantially increase funding across the board for olympic sports so as to improve our medal tally at the london olympics
8672987 however i think its time to reflect that the australian funding and training system has a much wider role than to simply focus on two weeks of olympic summer sport every four years
8672988 our large participation numbers are in non olympic sports and participation in them is an important component of the ascs mission to enrich the lives of all australians through sport
8672989 i can remember laying on the track and my right leg was on a 45 degree angle with my fibula broken in half and all the pain was in the left ankle
8672990 i thought to myself if my right leg is not looking flash and all the pain is in the left ankle i cant imagine what its like
8672991 doctors told me that i was lucky to keep my foot
8672992 im in pain 24 7 im having to have a drink of alcohol to numb the pain
8672993 i just sit at home watching tv my social life is gone im in that much pain that im in bed by 7pm just stuffed
8672994 thats what my life has got to my life has been turned upside down ive gone from a professional sportsman to a couch potato its hard to swallow
8672995 its hard on my wife tara and my daughter grace theres been a lot of people that have dropped off i cant even get a wrong number call now
8672996 its going to be their toughest road trip this year no doubt there is so much emotion involved here
8672997 its going to be a very tough game probably one of the toughest road trips this season
8672998 theres going to be plenty of emotion wrapped around a game of footy
8672999 playing newcastle at newy is a daunting task at the best of times weve been trying to work on the things we do at olympic park and emulate that in away games
8673000 we did a couple of those things against penrith so well see how we go in newcastle these are the types of games you want to be a part of
8673001 there are 14 teams fighting for eight spots in the finals with two weeks to go any team can beat any team on their day
8673002 i havent won too many of these grand slam matches so this feels pretty good
8673003 it was really about self belief i am feeling more and more comfortable in best of five set matches and i thought i handled it pretty well
8673004 i played him twice this year already and its one all he beat me pretty convincingly last time so hopefully i can get a bit of revenge
8673005 right now my confidence is pretty high ive been playing pretty well these last four or five weeks so im feeling good
8673006 i had a really good match against james blake at the olympics i feel like i can keep this roll going
8673007 if i did it would just be a distraction so theres no point once you get on the court you can only do what youre capable of
8673008 its in the back of my mind its going to be an interesting tie for us and a tough one because chile are always difficult to play down there but well go in with good spirits and well do our best
8673009 lleytons not going to be around forever and were going to have to learn to deal with that eventually
8673010 after it happened i was thinking more of it than i was the pain so it is not really a big deal
8673011 it was really tough i am completely out of breath
8673012 i think he has the desire to get there and i wouldnt back against him
8673013 he is as mentally tough as anyone he just knows his game knows himself knows what he needs to do with his preparation so well if he wants to achieve something he can almost get narrow minded about it not in an arrogant or disrespectful sense but he can focus in on it
8673014 thats what he does he tends to be able to realise if he focuses on his role thats going to be to the teams greatest benefit
8673015 obviously he is taking his time to get this injury right
8673016 i would say he is doing that because he sees he has a reasonable amount of time left in the game otherwise i dont think he would be investing all the time and effort into it to get it right
8673017 im basing my stand on the fact hes missed work
8673018 theres no chance both will win on saturday the one that might win is miss andretti
8673019 how about michael eskander gives us odds of 3 on saturday that might shut him up
8673020 we got the vet down on tuesday to nip these rumours in the bud once and for all
8673021 the course is flat and not brutal so if a rider makes a tactical mistake he has the next day to correct this fault
8673022 this event is the breeding ground youve only got to look at recent history
8673023 its the race where the top young guys learn about themselves and their abilities
8673024 im going to have some more tests when i get back to australia
8673025 i feel ok at the moment but i get worn out easily my swing hasnt been great since loch lomond the week before the
8673026 this has been a bit of a crazy year especially the last six months over the last few months with illness and injury i just havent been able to put the work in and my games suffering a bit
8673027 im encouraged that security acted so quickly but i have zero tolerance for the kind of behavior this mother and this child showed
8673028 whats a year i remembered thinking to myself as i had signed the contract recklessly flicking through pages ignoring bold capitals announcing the death penalty
8673029 in a thoughtless flourish i found myself now subject to the laws of saudi arabia decapitation included
8673030 you see so very few articulate moderate voices coming out where are the movies where is the music where is the poetry where are the books to counteract some of this violent ideology
8673031 el d a de ayer se liber el beta 2 de
8673032 this are all a mouthful of lies from prof atta mills
8673033 included in the many that spent time in exile were the late victor owusu former presidential candidate mr j h mensah dan botwe asamoah boateng nana addo dankwa akufo addo and myself dr authur kennedy
8673034 all these were brave and loyal citizens who risked their lives and liberties for the freedoms we have today that so many in the npp can be counted amongst the ranks of these brave citizens of our land is perhaps testament to our partys commitment to freedom
8673035 furthermore their names on this role are testament not to cowardice as prof mills claims but to bravery indeed to have survived the dictatorship by maintaining silence in the face of the pervasive evil as prof mills and many others did may have been prudent but it was not courageous
8673036 those were the days when lawyers like nana addo dankwa akufo addo and sam okudzeto stood like sentinels in our dark night showing that right will eventually triumph over the evil of the pndc
8673037 maybe if prof mills needs to be reminded of the events of those days he should talk to his mentor former president rawlings if prof mills could not join the many who sacrificed let him not dishonour their service
8673038 the issue of drivers the police and road safety must be carefully balanced in the interest of the public the recent spate of accidents many stemming from driver error and indiscipline is a major concern for all ghanaians including drivers
8673039 where was prof mills concern about arbitrary arrests when people were picked from their homes and either jailed or executed during the pndc era
8673040 when the ndc had a chance to prospect for oil with prof mills at the helm of ghanas economic management team and hon john mahama at his side he chose to focus the gnpc on everything except prospecting for oil he has no credibility on that issue
8673041 finally all these are consistent with the ndcs policy of lying about everything just to get elected we urge the people of ghana to reject them
8673042 we are for free education for the senior high school level and what is the ndc for
8673043 we are for strengthening nhis and extending its benefits to pregnant women and children and what are they for
8673044 we are for bridging the gap between the north and the south and what are they for
8673045 we will foster the environment for entrepreneurs to create the good high paying jobs of tomorrow and what are they for
8673046 we are for doubling the size of the police and improving the quality of their training and what is the ndc for
8673047 the happy implication was that they alone the four of them were painfully alive in a drugged and dying culture
8673048 you could have called my bluff in a minute but you didnt you were too good and young and scared you played right along with it and thats how the whole thing started thats how we both got committed to this enormous delusion because thats what it is an enormous obscene delusion this idea that people have to resign from real life and settle down when they have families its the great sentimental lie of the suburbs and ive been making you subscribe to it all this time ive been making you live by it my god ive even gone as far as to work up this completely corny soap opera picture of myself now do you see what you have to forgive me for and why we have to get out of here and over to europe as fast as we possibly can
8673049 and mrs givings had never been able to explain or even to understand that what she loved was not the job it could have been any job or even the independence it gave her though of course that was important for a woman constantly veering toward the brink of divorce deep down what shed loved and needed was the work itself
8673050 h e crept back to the front door pushed aside the dusty net curtain that covered its glass and peered down just in time for a rear view of norma out on the curb wagging her handbag for a taxi her back was stiff with anger and there was something extremely pathetic about her suitcase which looked expensive and brand new she had probably spent days buying it and weeks shopping for the things that would ride in its silken depths today new bathing suits slacks sun lotion a new camera all the fussy careful apparatus of a girlish good time with the odd whimpering sounds still bubbling up from his rib cage he felt an incongruous wave of tenderness go out to her as she climbed into the cab and rolled away
8673051 the group womens council was set up to drive the banks gender agenda supporting our overall diversity amp inclusion programme
8673052 the councils objective is to help women in standard chartered realise their full potential through personal development and supportive workplace practices implemented in an engaging and inclusive workplace
8673053 standard chartereds strength is the diversity of our people mirroring our customers and the communities we operate in
8673054 we believe that we also have the potential to lead the way on gender diversity
8673055 this includes identification and promotion of role models celebrating international womens day across the bank launching womens networks and a womens forum website
8673056 standard chartered bank wants to be an exemplar employer of diversity and inclusion across our markets in asia africa and the middle east
8673057 the key goal of this programme is to provide tools and support to our talented women to help them realise their potential which in turn we hope will lead to an increase in female representation in senior global and regional management positions
8673058 i cant articulate how much the quality of my life is improved
8673059 i am able to do more both at home and work and most importantly spend useful time with my daughter tanya my productivity has increased and tempers are no longer frayed the stress levels have gone down and i am a much happier person now
8673060 the guy came round and said sorry mate we are just trying to make a living
8673061 all sorts of people would go in and out of the gun factory including afro caribbean asian and white guys
8673062 we certainly could not have done anything sooner it came as a hell of a shock when we found out what it was
8673063 a gun factory is not the sort of thing you expect to find in a country village
8673064 it was actually discovered by the polish guys not related to the gun factory who were renting the house i was in my garden with my neighbour we saw some noise coming from the sheds
8673065 the polish men asked us to come over and have a look there was a lot of machinery and computer equipment it was pretty dark in there and i did not think a lot of it
8673066 however we went back and got some torches i used to be in a gun club in hong kong in the early 70s and know a bit about guns
8673067 when i looked inside it started to ring bells inside a metal shed in the shed there was live ammunition and pre fabricated barrels
8673068 they had sound proofed it and outside the metal shed we did not see anything too incriminating inside the metal shed i said i tell you what i think that is gun making equipment
8673069 the house had been a house of horrors for ages
8673070 the theale police neighbourhood action group nag agreed a few weeks ago that a local dispersal order would not be renewed believing that cctv would be installed in theale within a couple of months
8673071 now were told that it wont even be ordered until the end of the year
8673072 first we were told that it would be installed by this may then that it would be ordered by may now we will be lucky to have it in place by may next year
8673073 the tory administration at west berkshire council has belatedly decided to follow european union procurement rules despite the fact that the value of the contract will be below the eu threshold
8673074 were only talking about a handful of cameras if they had taken this decision at the beginning the cameras would probably be installed by now
8673075 i understand his frustration but when we are advised to follow a particular procurement route it is generally wise to do so to do otherwise would put the council at risk of legal challenge with all the unnecessary expense that this would bring ultimately at a cost to those who pay council tax
8673076 they are most effective when introduced as part of a package of measures which would include strengthening police presence and using measures to reduce anti social behaviour
8673077 the theale police neighbourhood action group nag agreed a few weeks ago that a local dispersal order would not be renewed believing that cctv would be installed in theale within a couple of months

8673084 it was just incredible the best moment of my life
8673085 i was expecting it to be breathtaking and it turned out to be even more breathtaking than i imagined the idea was to play a mixture of classical fused with folk and soul to reflect the essence and the different sides of london
8673086 i love the song itself and the arrangement i thought it was the perfect way to show what london is all about
8673087 i was pretty nervous but david helped calm me down a bit he is one of the nicest people ive ever met he was very genuine and it was just like chatting away to anybody
8673088 i tried to prepare myself by watching the opening ceremony but nothing prepares you for when the lights go off and everyone stares at you
8673089 we thought she did brilliantly we were amazed at how relaxed she was
8673090 we knew she was anxious about appearing in front of so many people but she carried it off with ease
8673091 i used to be a season ticket holder at reading and im a big fan of his i would have loved it if he had been on stage too
8673092 the one olympian i really wanted to talk to was chris hoy
8673093 hes my hero i stayed up to the early hours to watch him compete on the track
8673094 it was a great honour to perform in front of people like him
8673095 perhaps it was god who put these two great resources right next to each other
8673096 what is this i hear about you give an account of your stewardship for you can no longer be steward he who is faithful in a very little thing is faithful also in much and he who is unrighteous in a very little thing is unrighteous in much you cannot serve both god and mammon
8673097 we gave all existing tenants on the ground floor the opportunity to remodel their business and bring it up to date with the new downtown some decided to stay and some decided that its just not for them

8673102 my husband and i have caught most of them and i was just wondering if the portrayal was accurate if so then i am surprised we still have people who want to be in the miltary
8673103 recently while at the airport i noticed an army man waiting for his plane i talked with him briefly and found out he was on his way to iraq of course i thanked him for his service but i also wanted to give him some money for a lunch or dinner he had to wait several hours as an extra show of appreciation from a civie to a service member would that have been out of line would that be offensive in any way what are some of the guidelines for showing appreciation if any

8673112 es un tratamiento que le cabe a todos los afiliados del gremio cuando se incurre en actos de inconducta sindical se lo lleva la congreso extraordinario y ah es el tribunal de tica el que decide
8673113 me parece que m s all de si hubo manipulaci n o no la pregunta es qu es lo que tiene que dar a conocer los medios y eso se resuelve preguntando
8673114 no me parece que lo inc modo del asunto sea si era real o no era real porque si hubiera sido textual tampoco convalida la publicaci n de algo que forma parte de un proceso que involucra la muerte de personas
8673115 el caso de la placa del di logo entre los pilotos es el mismo caso que el de las im genes de nora dalmasso o las im genes que pas tvr en relaci n a grassi yo no necesito ver eso y lo que si necesito como dijo tom s abraham es saber un mont n de cosas que no me est n contando
8673116 con el caso del accidente a reo nosotros estamos en medio de una discusi n p blica acerca de lo que es la aerol nea de bandera y sabemos que espa a tiene que ver con lo que nos pasa mucho m s necesario entonces para un ciudadano argentino hoy es conocer el entramado del negocio que tiene que ver con la seguridad a rea en general que particularmente lo que estaban hablando los pilotos antes de despegar
8673117 en ese audio se pod a escuchar a los pilotos hablando livianamente pero al margen de que ellos ya no estaban para defenderse hay una familia hay gente involucrada en esa informaci n la pregunta es si la tiene que conocer primero la ciudadan a o el juez
8673118 pueden distraer durante alg n tiempo pero queda en eso
8673119 construir juntos todos los argentinos una historia diferente de hechos y de obras
8673120 no son ni las palabras ni insultos ni los obst culos los que cambian la historia son los hechos son las obras
8673121 lo dem s es apenas un ejercicio dial ctico medi tico que puede distraer durante alg n tiempo pero que queda en eso
8673122 yo me quedo con esta forma de construir la argentina de construir la pol tica la historia la transformamos entre todos y con hechos y obras
8673123 m s importante hecha en los ltimos 30 a os en la rep blica argentina
8673124 es mi tercera visita desde que soy presidenta y seguramente no va a ser la ultima porque es una provincia que llevo en mi coraz n
8673125 esta patriada de salvar a la argentina hist rica de la agresion comunista
8673126 la sierra maestra de la agresi n marxista leninista que quer a convertir a argentina en un sat lite de la urss
8673127 me considero un perseguido pol tico por los derrotados de ayer en la guerra justa y en las urnas por el voto de los tucumanos y hoy encumbrados ebrios de rencor y venganza en los mas altos cargos del poder nacional y provincial violentando todos los principios del derecho internacional
8673128 los guerrilleros de los a os 70 hoy est n en el poder
8673129 los argentinos estamos sufriendo una guerra desatada por los sicarios vern culos del comunismo internacional
8673130 los terroristas que entonces estaban en la ilegalidad ahora se apropiaron de la legalidad y pretenden ser pac ficos ciudadanos y convertirnos a su sistema esclavista
8673131 hace 50 a os la guerra revolucionaria de la subversi n estallo repentina y brutalmente para apropiarse del alma de nuestro pueblo y someterlo a un r gimen despiadado y brutal un r gimen comunista bajo el cual nos convertir amos en sat lite de la uni n sovi tica y su sucursal americana cuba
8673132 las fuerzas armadas aplicando leyes y reglamentos militares en vigencia cumplieron la mision encomendada por la naci n de vencer al enemigo y al acortar la guerra ahorraron sufrimientos a la patria
8673133 al se or vargas aignasse no lo vi ni lo trat en toda mi vida
8673134 la orden de detenci n de vargas aignasse era de car cter inexcusable e insoslayable y proven a de la junta militar

8673136 en t rminos econ micos no es lo mismo el dinero destinado para un torneo con 200 mil chicos inscriptos que son lo que suponemos que hay que para uno con 1 mill n como dicen que hay
8673137 a eso sumado que hay chicos que compiten en distintas disciplinas y por eso se los inscribe tantas veces como cuantas disciplinas practica
8673138 para ingresar a los torneos provinciales se necesita una autorizaci n expresa distinta de los padres y una revisi n m dica especial no se pueden pasar planillas y cargar los datos de los chicos de un torneo a otro esto nunca pas en la provincia

8673165 i am sure that today nana is going to tell the ga people what plans he has for them in this transformation agenda
8673166 we have always received overwhelming support and attendance everywhere nana akufo addo goes and i would not be surprised if bukom goes wild as happened in kasoa and takoradi i am sure that the people of bukom would not want to be left out
8673167 they should stop criticizing the electoral commission and the police service and allow them to do their work
8673168 they know they cant compete with the npp when it comes to issue based campaigning
8673169 damaging the reputation of the electoral commission and the police service in order to win the public favour will not help them and the country as a whole so they should put a stop to that
8673170 do i look like one of those damn things to you
8673171 they tried to humiliate me and i was not going to be humiliated over this
8673172 if i was carrying nail clippers and forgot about them i wouldnt have gotten so upset but here i was just wearing my underwear
8673173 its actually a little funny in a way but a sad sad commentary on the state of our country
8673174 this is bigger than just me there are 150 million women in america and this could happen to any of them

8673177 yes we didnt make it but we had a good time trying
8673178 many of you feel the responsibility to represent the voters in your state
8673179 the hurt that some of us feel will be so much worse if mccain is elected
8673180 what is so important is that by the end of the day we will nominate barack obama and joe biden
8673181 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8673182 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8673183 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care

8673190 this averages out to about 20 vehicles a week which is great
8673191 we have done a great job fixing a lot of vehicles during this campaign so congratulations
8673192 they are very professional and work very hard to support the iraqi army and our country
8673193 this is a result of their hard work and sacrifice
8673194 through this effort we are able to insure the country is more secure
8673195 we are excited to open this new sams club in deptford our members have been very supportive during our relocation
8673196 our existing location has served this community for 17 years and now we are turning the page with a fantastic new club that offers services like pharmacy fuel and rotisserie we are also conveniently located and expect our deptford members will save time and gas by shopping sams club for all their home and business needs i have enjoyed my time here in deptford and i look forward to many more years with our members in this new location
8673197 we expect operating revenue to be weak compounded by the expectation for additional asset write downs
8673198 we expect investment banking revenues will be soft as the ipo market was virtually non existent on the heels of a slow july
8673199 we never said the show would not go through the normal channels it will be going through the normal screening services before it premieres on sept 2
8673200 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night and letting all our constituents see it at the same time
8673201 today workers at invesco field are putting the final touches on the newest wonder of the modern political world the temple of obama
8673202 it is upon this pulpit that barack obama will tomorrow night adress thousands of screaming adoring fans

8673204 runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for its jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8673205 i need a job and got kids i heard that they need some help now
8673206 all them mexicans got fired because they didnt have a pass all these businesses have been taking americans jobs
8673207 im a high school teacher i enjoy younger people im not part of their group age wise but emotionally im about 12
8673208 hes the oldest guy out there and unfortunately that works against people all the time even though theres probably nobody better equipped for this game hes probably the guy who will be the biggest asset if they dont get foolish and vote him out
8673209 i will win survivor because im the bombshell baller im bodacious and i outwit and outlast and outplay and i need a million dollars really bad
8673210 michelle is a wild card for me because i actually thought that michelle had a good solid energy coming into the game but shes very small and very young i think her life experience is the big question mark what will she do when the going gets tough
8673211 in addition to trying to be charismatic and active in the challenges i have a little additional problem which is that from societys viewpoint i have been very successful already
8673212 marcus is a physician as he likes to remind people and he is a true leader an extremely bright guy hes a hero he is a huge threat to win the game for sure he has looks hes got smarts hes probably the fittest guy out there so hes got a lot of things going for him
8673213 the first player that i see going off thinking theyre gonna track an elephant or a hippo im gonna kick their ass because we dont need them coming into our camp
8673214 susie is a mom and she likes to talk thats definitely her biggest obstacle to overcome that she cant shut up if i went in and played this game and got teamed up with susie i would be wary of her hanging in there with me because she seems to go with the wind and doesnt even seem like shes paying attention at times
8673215 my achilles heel in this game will most likely be trust you have to have trust to win this game but you have to know who is untrustworthy and thats probably the most difficult task
8673216 hes earnest but he is his own worst enemy he means well and does not know when to shut up hes like a cocker spaniel charming and annoying at the same time
8673217 its kind of one of my natural instincts to flirt i dont mean to thats actually going to be something i watch because i dont want a target to be on my back from the other girls
8673218 i think jacque will be a bit of a dark horse i dont think shell be a leader i think shell use her looks and her charm to get in with the right guy and hope that she can ride with that guy as far as she can if jacque gets deep into the show i think shes a legitimate threat at the challenges shes pretty fit
8673219 im a fierce competitor i dont want to lose i was raised in the mountains and also in the city so i got the wilderness down and i got the humanity down
8673220 i think matty will be one of the favorites this season someone people will absolutely love i find him to be one of the most endearing guys weve ever had on the show to the point where it could work against him because he cant hide anything if hes confused he says im confused if hes happy hes smiling if hes sad hes crying
8673221 i love doing all sorts of crazy things it doesnt matter what age you are as long as you can physically do it do it and hopefully theyll look at me as a mom and you know who would like to kick their mother out of the game
8673222 charm is her strength because shes likable in doses and thats her liability
8673223 i will win survivor because i need this million dollars more than anyone out here
8673224 g c is a fish out of water does he have the fortitude to really do this because when i talked to him before the show it seemed like a lot of nervous energy masquerading as confidence but it was really i felt fear like what am i getting into and thats not a good place to be because what youre getting into is a big ol headache
8673225 i think i deserve it ive worked really hard in my life im very competitive im stubborn im compassionate and passionate
8673226 paloma is sassy cute my question for her is is her attitude real or is it a put on and if it is a put on how long will she be able to sustain it when she starts getting hungry palomas going to have to pick the right alliance who you decide to team up with early on has such an impact on how you do in the game because if you pick the wrong people it can be hard to get out from under that
8673227 i havent really noticed any crazy people which kind of makes me nervous that either im the crazy person or there are no crazy people
8673228 charlie prides himself on being very bright and educated and the question id say for charlie is can he stand up for himself does he really have a voice or is he just going to look for somebody to hang on to and see how far theyll pull him along
8673229 i will win survivor because i have the three bs brains beauty and blazing speed
8673230 i think crystals big dilemma is going to be what does she say that she does who does she say she is because its obvious shes an athlete crystal has a mouth on her she does not edit that makes her great at tribal council but a liability in the game
8673231 ill step on toes if i have to these people were not friends of mine last week and time will tell if theyll be friends of mine two months from now but a million dollars is more important than their friendship except maybe with that one blonde with the big t that might be worth a few hundred grand
8673232 randy is crotchety and clever hes the guy who will come to tribal council and try to challenge me which is a huge mistake because im not playing for a million dollars but i dont think hes as evil as he wants you to think he is
8673233 im funny and im fun and im energetic and i bring a positive vibe to the group like a burst of sunshine
8673234 the way i would describe kelly is that she is part of the text message generation
8673235 gaming will help me because i do well under pressure i always come through i rarely choke im the underdog i think all the fans will root for me to win i would root for myself if i was watching tv
8673236 ken the gamer is one of my favorite people who has been on the show in a long time he is convinced his gaming expertise is absolutely in line with what it takes to win that he knows this game backward and forward simply because hes a gamer but ken is a true nerd i think when the show began he weighed less than chinas courtney did
8673237 honestly like im a girl weve all starved ourselves here and there i can starve for a little while i think there are no losers in survivor we all come home skinny detoxed and tan were all winners
8673238 corinne is a self proclaimed ber bitch and she owns it i think the meanest thing you could say to corinne would be to say youre very pleasant she would take that as an insult of the highest order
8673239 i watch the game i know how to play the game ive done sales my whole life im good with people and im physically adept and im a manipulative bastard
8673240 you would expect him to be like a villain in a bond movie who dies a horrible death at the end its almost like a blind arrogance and hes really fun to watch and i think his accent could work for him or against him but there is something about the accent that makes everything he says seem smarter
8673241 i want to make everyone fall in love with me and i want to be friends with everybody thats all i got my personality im not strong
8673242 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house down last night
8673243 we are at the point of beginning a feasibility study
8673244 it wouldnt be appropriate to jump in until we are approached with an idea that is feasible but i think people are informally supportive
8673245 it would be really good to gauge that public support for that spot
8673246 here is something that children can go to and learn about the environment
8673247 exorbitant energy prices and an anticipated overload of requests for home heating assistance that will deplete funds and supplies very quickly
8673248 patients come before money and we are currently in talks with the ministry about that
8673249 in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8673250 those who choose not to go to australia will retain their place on the waiting list here
8673251 its not an isolated case as waiting lists at other dhbs are just as bad
8673252 we conclude that reversal of clarks conviction is necessary in the case to ensure fairness and integrity of the judicial process
8673253 accordingly we hold that the court committed plain error when it failed to give the accomplice jury instruction and that clarks convictions must therefore be reversed on this basis
8673254 i would reverse clarks conviction outright and not remand for a new trial
8673255 they are confiscating the means for us to do our work
8673256 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years
8673257 hes a former marine and great guy and hes older than i am so that might work
8673258 those are questions for the mccain campaign and i think they are going to make their announcement shortly
8673259 ive got no worries about that i rang wayne smith and asked him for his thoughts about it and he said it will help develop my skills a little bit more
8673260 obviously i will be getting some time at nine later in the game hopefully i can use that time wisely
8673261 being out at 10 you have a bit more vision to see where people are and who is coming out of the line so i guess that in a way helps my development and vision at nine
8673262 i definitely do enjoy first five too its good to be out at 10 because you can sort of have the opportunity to run at the line and test the line
8673263 but its the main thing to consider that selection for the black jersey its getting back into ordering the troops around and making sure im doing my best to check the defence line and put boys into holes
8673264 hes the all black no 9 or one of them but its just that we have so many injuries we need that experience in that area
8673265 senator obamas speech tonight will be as he himself has characterized it more workmanlike a very direct conversation with the american people about the choice we face in this election about the risk of staying on the same path were on the risk of just more of the same versus the change we need
8673266 i am scheduled to be in minnesota tomorrow to be at the state fair
8673267 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years
8673268 doing the speech at mile high is an important point for our campaign its symbolic of how sen obama won the nomination it will show how obama wants to involve people who are not usually involved in the political process
8673269 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8673270 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8673271 reason to suspect that an investigation may reveal serious and complex fraud
8673272 it was clear to me then there were two quite different points of view at that point it becomes a matter between mr glenn and mr peters and the news media it is not a matter for me
8673273 men can be so stupid but cake is always good
8673274 pienso que estoy hablando adelante del pr ximo gobernador de una provincia del pr ximo presidente de la naci n porque ustedes son el futuro de mi patria
8673275 demostramos al gobierno nacional y a los obsecuentes que nosotros podemos reclamar en paz y no necesitamos confrontar a nadie
8673276 todo esto que ustedes me dan es much sima responsabilidad que me la estoy cargando
8673277 los que nos hablan de distribuci n de la riqueza son los que m s est n concentrando y si no f jense qu pasa con la lecher a con la ganader a con las econom as regionales hablan de la renta extraordinaria y no conocen el pa s siguen enga ando a la gente
8673278 para nosotros es mucha plata pero para repartir en cinco provincias son dos pesos por vaca y es una verg enza es medio litro de agua mineral y las vacas toman 50 por d a
8673279 saqueando las provincias y no haya plata para la educaci n la salud y la seguridad est n empobreciendo a los pueblos del interior
8673280 si pagan 1 25 todos ustedes van a producir m s
8673281 educaci n capacitaci n y participaci n pero eso es lo que m s hay que poner participar en todo
8673282 tenemos que hacer un gran acto y si no llegamos a las definiciones vamos a tener que hacer como los caudillos hace 200 a os ir a amarrar los potros a la pir mide de mayo
8673283 australia is not an island we are going through difficult economic times and six of the seven largest industrial economies around the world have registered either zero or negative growth
8673284 if you look at any business confidence or consumer confidence index in any of those industrial economies you see a gloomy picture
8673285 here it is being compounded by what we have inherited at the end of last year
8673286 to take the proceeds from the mining boom in the past and invest in the future of our skills and our infrastructure because a productivity improvement is absolutely necessary to see this economy through in the long term
8673287 according to the abs australian bureau of statistics data today the private capital expenditure rose by a stronger than expected 5 7 per cent in the june 2008 quarter
8673288 i would ask this question why is it that when theres positive economic data out there that those opposite find no reason to embrace that in their argument at all
8673289 it suggest that therell be continued capital expenditure to try and alleviate some of the constraints that have prevailed for several years now so it definitely is a positive thing for medium term inflation
8673290 the cost to the taxpayer is an increase in electricity prices because well be introducing peakers by and large into the system instead of baseload
8673291 a package we have to go forward with to restore our economic credibility
8673292 o sucesso da rtp2 uma partilha de sucesso com os realizadores portugueses
8673293 acho que vamos encontrar mais p blico num resumo de uma hora

8673295 a actual ministra da sa de parece ser uma honesta defensora do servi o nacional de sa de ter poder os sinais n o s o animadores
8673296 we are relating to cable based on our user interface our search and overall consumer experience that are independent of where the storage capacity lies be that in the home the headend or wherever
8673297 see this ruling having anything to do with our business relationship with the cable world
8673298 has total inadequate capacity at this point for broad scale deployment of a network dvr solution
8673299 our view is that there are a lot of legal issues that still need to be resolved on that front and have not by any means yet been clarified
8673300 we were able to scratch out one run against him and nothing else hes a throwback for giants fans to juan marichal coming over the top and with thump on his fastball he has a filthy change and he was on
8673301 louis is outrageous and likes to bitch he makes everyone laugh but he can be a bit mean to the contestants
8673302 i had heard that simon was a bit of a diva that he preened himself in the mirror a lot but hes changed
8673303 he isnt like that anymore hes very hard working and is very encouraging to the panel
8673304 what bothered me was not getting ahead of guys and not throwing strikes
8673305 i need to start making adjustments its not a good feeling to let your team down
8673306 i just try to get as many ground balls as i can
8673307 those guys have been turning double plays for me all year
8673308 i might have looked calm on the outside but i was shaking and i suspect i will be the same on strictly im quite shy but am looking forward to learning such a beautiful skill
8673309 many global companies now view green initiatives as necessary to staying competitive quite a change from the views of yester year now businesses realise that they can make long term savings and increase operational efficiencies through implementing greener ways of working especially around technology and this is especially true in difficult economic circumstances like now green it in practice and our new best practice report on it gives business leaders the information and insight they need to boost their green credentials
8673310 the preservation and empowerment of long term family wealth is based on the education and behavior of each family member its a dynamic process that must be re energized in each successive generation
8673311 no matter how large or small your estate or income level you can take the steps towards optimizing the true wealth within your family
8673312 its a matter of every family member recognizing the relative value of each asset and acting appropriately to optimize it
8673313 the mission of smartstart giving is to help entrepreneurs everywhere in the world while were thrilled to be aiding so many entrepreneurs in developing countries theres still support needed closer to home were bringing brower in to share his message with our donor entrepreneurs because their hopes dreams and families are important to us too the process of supporting self discovery benefits everyone and is a natural lead in to opening hearts and sharing the wealth
8673314 rising gas prices leading edge technology and the push for work life flexibility have all come together in the past 12 months to create a pretty dramatic increase in telework across the u s and canada
8673315 our concern about coral reef damage has brought us a new awareness of the harm caused by reef fish feeding by ceasing to sell fish food we will hopefully not only reduce supply but also raise consciousness about the damage wrought

8673411 i dont usually dance for fear of being categorised as an embarrassing dad but im getting tips from fiona phillips and kate garraway who have both said that this show was the best thing that they have ever done in their lives
8673412 you have to relish it if you come to rangers and if the first old firm game passes you by then you will regret it we will have the boys focussed
8673413 we had been crying out some creativity due to the absence of barry and we have that now
8673414 we have lads who can take the ball and play passes and in an old firm game that can be important
8673415 if you can turn over one of your main rivals away from home then it is a massive boost
8673416 you want to go to parkhead pittodrie and tannadice and pick up points and if you can do that then you are
8673417 we have a good home record and if we can pick up points at the major grounds this season then that will stand us in good stead
8673418 i didnt suffer too many defeats in my career and hopefully i can pass that good fortune onto the lads for this weekend
8673419 if you win its fantastic and i hope the boys get to experience that this weekend
8673420 i hope the fans get behind me as i know this is the game they are looking for the team to do
8673421 i have obviously come back here in special circumstances and i always knew people would oppose the move
8673422 that was to be expected but to be honest i really dont think they have been bad so far
8673423 i think the majority of folk have been fantastic and the negative reaction from some hasnt hindered my performances in any way
8673424 with that said i think this game is one where people need to back the whole team and hopefully i can get a goal and change a few minds
8673425 im sure if i play a part in the match and we get a good result the fans will look upon things positively
8673426 they are exactly the same as the players and want to win these games every bit as much as we do
8673427 whether the league has already been won or not and no matter what is at stake winning means everything in an old firm match
8673428 i dont really see my situation now as being the same as a couple of seasons ago at all
8673429 i didnt even start the first two league games here but i was in the team every week at celtic
8673430 going into the derby a couple of seasons back i had been heavily involved but that hasnt been the case so far at rangers
8673431 i missed the first spl game through injury and only came on for the last half an hour in the second
8673432 i know the longer i go without a goal it isnt great and i want to get off and running but ive only made one start in the league so far
8673433 i dont feel under any pressure if our team is winning then thats all that matters
8673434 i dont care if its me scoring the goals or not
8673435 i just want to contribute to the teams success although at the same time you always want to score your first goal as soon as possible when you are at a new club
8673436 i definitely want to play this weekend and it would be a dream to score as well
8673437 whether it is is your first old firm derby or your 21st theres never a bad time to score in one
8673438 it was a fantastic occasion to be involved and it was obviously a good result for us
8673439 winning makes the difference and any kind of victory for us at parkhead would be great for the club
8673440 its vital we get the right result some players have got carried away in the past in this one but i think we have a squad that can keep its head at parkhead
8673441 if you look at the games there at the end of last season we were unlucky and rangers would have won the title if they had drawn either of them
8673442 we will be looking to win this one end of story
8673443 if we do it will be brilliant but if we dont then there is still a long way to go
8673444 games at this stage of the season dont win the title although victory would give us an early advantage
8673445 i hope i will surprise myself and be good at dancing i just hope i dont fall over or forget the steps
8673446 people always tell you about games against celtic but i think you probably need to play in one to really live it
8673447 they are special fixtures for the supporters and i really hope i get the chance to take part and that my team mates and i do as well as possible
8673448 i have enjoyed my time in scotland so far and everything is going well both on and off the pitch
8673449 the lads in the squad have been fantastic and my family are here so i am happy with life as im playing well too
8673450 now im looking for three points against celtic if we get them ill definitely be opening the champagne ive won thats a promise
8673451 we were disappointed only to take one point from the aberdeen game but we are confident of building on the good things we did there
8673452 it is up to us to improve and try to play as well as we did in spells for longer periods of the game
8673453 we will work hard this week and make sure we are ready for celtic i can only speak about how weve done since i joined rangers but i think we have done well
8673454 based on the last couple of performances i think the team is improving and we just need to keep looking to do that
8673455 in his dream i didnt win the show but apparently didnt do too badly so im hoping his premonition becomes a reality
8673456 my son thinks ill be an embarrassment but i thought it was about time i had a bit of fun doing something i enjoy ive got my foot spa ready to look after my tired and pained feet

8673461 we will take a gigantic leap when obama becomes president but we all have to roll up our sleeves and ensure that his dream can be fulfilled

8673493 internet skills are like any concept which necessitates student instruction
8673494 since these skills are not tested by many states other areas of instruction that are tested get class time priority because of this issue many students may not have had direct instruction on how to perform research and their skills reflect this
8673495 teachers can create a hotlist of websites for students to explore and discuss in class
8673496 by giving examples of acceptable and unacceptable standards that students need to look for in websites students learn to quickly assess sites for validity
8673497 parents who do not use the internet and youngsters who do may not be aware of the skills needed for effective searching students tend to do what other youngsters have taught them or rely on their own self developed ways of searching
8673498 but what the educators are typically not as aware of is this that the implications of having so much information at our fingertips means that critical thinking skills are more important
8673499 its more than simple retrieval skills tests that ask students to retrieve facts are silly the kids have the internet to retrieve facts tests that ask our kids to use the facts to present an argument or develop a position this is critical thinking these are the skills our kids need to achieve in the twenty first century environment

8673632 o mcdonalds diz que est firme e ap ia nosso povo que vive e trabalha numa sociedade livre de discrimina o e importuna o mas eis o que o mcdonalds n o dir para voc o mcdonalds ajudou a patrocinar a parada do orgulho gay de san francisco
8673633 o mcdonalds tem orgulho de nossa for a de trabalho variada e do fato de que o grupo homossexual campanha pelos direitos humanos reconheceu o mcdonalds como uma empresa que demonstra ativamente seu compromisso para com gays e l sbicas
8673634 a empresa recusou declarando que continuar a apoiar a agenda gay inclusive o casamento homossexual a aaf pede um boicote s lanchonetes mcdonalds
8673635 esse boicote n o envolve oposi o ao direito de empregar funcion rios homossexuais nem no modo como eles s o tratados envolve a escolha do mcdonalds de investir seus recursos para promover a agenda homossexual
8673636 se por acaso voc ap ia a defini o hist rica acerca do casamento que e sempre foi homem e mulher ent o voc um provocador de dio e inimizade
8673637 donos de empresas crist os e outros com valores tradicionais seriam for ados sob penas legais a abandonar convic es religiosas e adotar a pr pria perspectiva secular humanista e relativista moral do mcdonalds do que certo e errado em muitos casos os donos de empresas seriam perseguidos mesmo que sua empresa em quest o fosse expressamente religiosa
8673638 essa lei joga o governo diretamente contra a livre express o religiosa e por esse motivo inconstitucional de cara
8673639 o mcdonalds est agora publicamente apoiando o casamento homossexual que um casamento falsificado apesar do fato de que de acordo com uma pesquisa de opini o p blica feita em mar o de 2007 pela tv cbs e pelo jornal new york times s 28 por cento dos americanos cr em que pares homossexuais devem ter permiss o de se casar legalmente
8673640 o casamento o alicerce fundamental de qualquer sociedade saud vel se algu m introduz dinheiro falsificado no mercado o d lar desvalorizado se algu m introduz o casamento falsificado na sociedade o casamento verdadeiro desvalorizado e a sociedade prejudicada
8673641 contudo o mcdonalds est jogando todo o seu peso marca comercial e reputa o para promover o casamento gay nos eua

8673654 the song is about feeling insecure and just not feeling pretty and i hope girls my age can relate to it because i just felt like there needed to be a song about how not everyone has confidence

8673679 i think there would be a big chance that eddie would be here and you guys wouldnt be
8673680 its been almost four years since eddie died and it doesnt take that long
8673681 one of the things i think about is him saying mom keep going keep going because for me its for him
8673682 everyone watches out for everyone elses stuff so it was a surprise
8673683 people of various ethnic groups coexist in harmony and equality and the situation in xinjiang is generally good
8673684 this has nothing to do with any alleged persecution or oppression of the uighur people
8673685 it is part of chinas worsening crackdown in the area
8673686 the international community should prevent the chinese government from carrying out their systematic crackdown policies on the uighurs
8673687 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8673688 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of president of the united states
8673689 those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believed this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8673690 i dont think theres anything to announce yet but i know that that is under discussion

8673693 the sco member states express their deep concern over the recent tensions surrounding the south ossetia question and call for the sides to peacefully resolve existing problems through dialogue
8673694 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8673695 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8673696 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8673697 with economies abroad slowing and the one time impact of tax rebates dissipating we expect annualized economic growth to recede to near 1 0 percent in the third quarter and to maintain this pace into early 2009 before gradually improving
8673698 the better than expected outcome overall does not change our view that the economy is weakening with the beneficial effects of rebate checks and foreign demand fading fast

8673707 the goal of the video games defense is to both shift blame and to explain to a judge and jury why this good kid is suddenly acting like a terrorist

8673730 whereas proprietary vendors sell software for a fee and then charge for support and upgrades open source makers supply the software for free and bill only for subsequent services
8673731 a public market should be transparent fair and most importantly open to all the solutions as well as the propositions must be evaluated objectively on known and accepted criteria
8673732 furthermore the regulation implies that public markets have to enhance the local economic development as well as the quebec technologies
8673733 free software utilization in public administration could create thousands of jobs as well as a significant decrease in software licensing costs

8673796 am i enjoying this yes because he tried to make my life miserable he did everything in his power to make my life go the wrong way but he didnt make me miserable because i dont believe him maybe if somebody else wrote that stuff about me then i would put attention on it and thats what he wanted he wanted attention he has to thank me because i gave him a lot of stuff to work with i know i helped him the last four years to make his money and obviously he did not help me at all to make my money
8673797 it almost feels like a zombie at this point its the walking dead
8673798 its such an abrupt end to what was e3 which had been this huge escalating arms race
8673799 weve pushed the limits of high system requirements and i think the rate at which people are buying crazy new hardware has slowed

8673801 for me i feel kiss is the perfect band as a musician a performer and an entertainer
8673802 it allows you to let loose and be whoever you want to be
8673803 its almost like when superman would put on the cape or batman would put on the mask in some ways it gives you the ability to take on a character or a persona of whatever you have inside of you or how you want to perform
8673804 we had our show we had our levitating platform we had our bombs we had our costumes and we had our kiss logo
8673805 kiss would always perform on time period and would always deliver the goods
8673806 its always supposed to be the greatest show on earth and an over the top presentation i get it because i was a fan once you saw them you were hooked because they really gave you a visual presentation not just the music
8673807 it was a really awkward time for me it was mixed emotions i was really excited but i also felt really bad
8673808 kiss in my opinion took it to the next level
8673809 when i was a kid i would run home from school put on kiss alive and think to myself one day one day ill rock the world with one of the best drummers in rock n roll from one on the hottest bands in the land kiss
8673810 like in all things in life never say never and anythings possible
8673811 but i think it would be really hard to replace gene or paul
8673812 i dont say this to kiss anyones ass but to me theres only one paul stanley you could never find somebody who can do what paul does not only is he the voice of kiss and as a frontman pauls going to go down in history as one of the best frontmen of all time of rock hes one of the few guys whose done it with a guitar strapped around his neck the whole time
8673813 im sure there will be more kiss touring in the future
8673814 after the success we had this year it makes perfect sense to keep going out and do this again
8673815 its a chance for me to play some cool songs with my friends i played in my fathers band which was american songbook like cole porter and gershwin and all those standards as well as big band and swing id never played in a cover band we play songs by deep purple zeppelin sabbath kiss and queen i like having chuck because he can sing he likes to do the m torhead and i dont have to tell you what a great guy he is hes a bandmate and a real friend

8673827 before the match i really believed i had a chance to win and i knew if i could hang in there and just get stuck in id be in with a good shot
8673828 even though i lost my serve and went 4 2 down i never felt at that point i lost the match
8673829 i felt if i just kept fighting and hanging in there my chance would come and i got there so im pretty pleased about it

8673888 sometimes when i watch the premier league i think its becoming what is it becoming does it really mean as much to the people who are playing i think that todays players dont have that same level of emotional attachment to the clubs they represent
8673889 with so much money involved does it mean as much to the individuals in it
8673890 my worry long term is if the premier league becomes a league table of individual wealth for the 20 wealthiest individuals around the world what will that mean
8673891 it wont mean a great deal at all and that will mean we have lost something incredibly precious which is institutions like liverpool that inspire local pride
8673892 football finances are very fragile and we have seen examples in the past where clubs have overreached themselves and it has had devastating consequences for the supporters more than anybody

8673898 but he was so cricket mad that he took a bit of persuading
8673899 no jamaican sportsman has ever had as much pressure on him not herb mckenley not george rhoden not arthur wint not don quarrie no one you have no idea how hard that is hes going to be the greatest sprinter this world has ever seen in fact he might be already

8673901 hes not like what you see on the tv i disagree with what jacques rogge said when you win an olympic medal thats the greatest thing ever you dont just want to win and walk off the track you want to entertain the crowd you want to open up and express how youre feeling his celebrations are a very good thing for the sport

8673968 an affront to federalism and an expensive burden that has far outlived its usefulness
8673969 the debate over the nomination had centered on judge pickerings civil rights record as a mississippi lawyer state lawmaker and federal judge over the course of decades senate democrats argued that he did not deserve elevation because he had written an article as a young man recommending ways to strengthen mississippis anti miscegenation laws left the democratic party in 1964 when the national party tried to integrate the state delegation to the national convention and more recently presided over a 1994 trial in which he took extraordinary steps to reduce the sentence of a man convicted in a cross burning incident
8673970 dole may have to take a stand on the controversial issue of whether sen trent lott r miss will continue as the senate majority leader
8673971 im pleased he has apologized and believe he is sincere in his regret if i thought for one second that trent lott was endorsing segregation he should resign but i dont believe he was
8673972 we wouldnt have had all these problems over all these years
8673973 were proud of it and if the rest of the country had followed our lead we wouldnt have had all these problems over all these years either
8673974 i support the president and i think its clear what the presidents reasons were we dont need to go through that what we are concerned about is a is that becomes a quota bill ive just mentioned that ive been supportive of an initiative to ensure that women and minorities are able to move through the ranks to top positions in government through our glass ceiling initiative and indeed thats not a quota bill either its just to ensure that everyone has equal opportunity
8673975 after decades of prodding and pushing this nation in the direction of equality the u s supreme court issued a series of controversial decisions that make it more difficult for minorities and women to prove discrimination at work but by approving the civil rights act of 1990 congress and president bush can reaffirm this nations absolute commitment to liberty and justice for all
8673976 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8673977 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8673978 a very popular error having the courage of ones convictions rather it is a matter of having the courage for an attack on ones convictions
8673979 shes using my daughter people never even knew who samantha ronson was until she met lindsay she was just some l a dj and now shes writing a book i am at wits end with this stuff this is not in lindsays best interest

8673985 those fears within the sam zells radio izing of the company look even more justified now a day after the los angeles times hired a top executive with roots in the phil anschutz empire he hires a new advertising senior vp from fm radio pretty sad that being mentioned as one of los angeles magazines ill fated 64 best things is written into a bio as a mentionable plus
8673986 it has been a very long process a very detailed process
8673987 theres been a tremendous amount of site work for the new fields
8673988 you can begin to see where the track and the fields are going to be
8673989 our student parking lot actually remains the same though the traffic pattern is different
8673990 thats a new rear exit that has been put in

8673996 it just doesnt make sense to me either the moment i read the screenplay i knew it was an important story and as its a true tale of heroic resistance to one of the great villains of history i cant imagine that people wont want to see it
8673997 we would have expected to read something like this in the onion fortunately for us its true unfortunately for obama its true
8673998 its only appropriate that barack obama would descend down from the heavens and spend a little time with us mere mortals when accepting the democratic nomination
8673999 weve done britneys sets and a whole bunch of rock shows but this was far more elaborate and complicated and we had to do it in far less time
8674000 the biggest challenge has been making sure we dont damage the playing field underneath
8674001 they stole 6 332 from me and then they had the legal muscle to get away with it
8674002 we have to assume the water was used because it went through the meter and we have no evidence that it was defective
8674003 he thought i should be able to make the problem go away
8674004 if i had a leak in my house i would repair it instantaneously
8674005 i think its intentional the ordinance is written that way to avoid any potential for giving away public services
8674006 this has siphoned off a tremendous amount of my energy a fair amount of my money and it has been unpleasant
8674007 indeed there doesnt seem to be a ready explanation for where the water could have gone
8674008 im not going to get into who i call or dont call
8674009 but this report that i called senator lieberman and told him you call senator mccain and withdraw from the vice presidential race is incorrect

8674011 what do you think impressed by the underlying resilience of the american economy
8674012 you know i dont think the gdp is ultimate truth
8674013 an estimated 20 4 million people in the united states used some kind of illicit drug in the past 30 days according to the latest government statistics about 8 3 percent of all persons age 12 and over are involved in use of illegal drugs or the nonmedical use of prescription drugs
8674014 the budget should be balanced the treasury should be refilled public debt should be reduced the arrogance of officialdom should be tempered and controlled and the assistance to foreign lands should be curtailed lest rome become bankrupt people must again learn to work instead of living on public assistance
8674015 it is a true saying that one falsehood leads easily to another
8674016 i have become a bit of a skeptic myself as i think the deflator of 1 3 is an incomplete measure of inflations damage
8674017 and the reason is the distinction between the gdp deflator which measures the price level for goods and services produced and the gross domestic purchases deflator which measures prices of goods and services purchased
8674018 due to oil prices for the items americans buy have been increasing much more rapidly than the items they produce as a result gdp inflation looks artificially low when in reality it is not comparable to the cpi

8674031 simon son of jonah do you love me more than these
8674032 these arrows arrive at a lovers eyes and and then travel to and pierce his or her heart and overwhelm him or her with desire and longing called love sickness
8674033 not an impulse and it doesnt come from feeling it does not always run with the natural inclinations nor does it spend itself only on those for whom some affinity is discovered

8674035 my hoover cant get enough out of his or her hoover and so i need a serious upgrade help me i need a power boost

8674045 nations will be gathered before him and he will separate them one from another as a shepherd divides the sheep from the goats
8674046 then the king will say to those on his right hand come you blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
8674047 yes im not a giving loving person i dont express the holy spirit of god but i have something else i have a substitute for love i have a substitute for love
8674048 i was a minister i was a minister and i gave sermons i motivated people i didnt love them but thats okay i preached at them
8674049 though i speak with the tongues of men and angels you know fabulous but if i do not have agape
8674050 in me then i have become a sounding brass or clanging cymbal
8674051 well i understand prophesy i know whats happening i know whats happening in the end time and i know all those little things that are going on in the government and everything else and i keep up with that so i may not have a lot of godly love but i do know whats going on thats a good substitute
8674052 though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and have all faith i can remove mountains if i dont have love i am nothing
8674053 well i dont have a lot of love but i give a lot i do a lot for others you know i send things i do things i give things i really dig deep and i give out to charities so thats going to cut me a lot of slack doesnt it say in the bible that love covers a multitude of sins so this is my act of benevolence and thats going to cover a multitude of sins
8674054 and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned but have not love it profits me nothing
8674055 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh
8674056 god did by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh on the account of sin he condemned sin in the flesh
8674057 for those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh
8674058 but those who live according to the spirit the things of the spirit
8674059 for it is not subject to the law of god
8674060 but of the spirit if indeed the spirit of god dwells in you
8674061 now if anyone does not have the spirit of christ
8674062 and if christ is in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness
8674063 but if the spirit of him who raised christ from the dead dwells in you he who raised christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his spirit who dwells in you
8674064 for as many as are led by the spirit of god
8674065 the spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of god
8674066 and if children then heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with christ if indeed we suffer with him
8674067 i just love it under the bus wouldnt be any other place
8674068 believe on the name of his son jesus christ and love one another
8674069 abides in christ and christ in him and by this we know that he abides in us by the spirit which he has given us

8674071 the introduction of a boil notice was deemed a necessary precautionary measure to ensure that public health was not put at risk limerick county council will continue to monitor the water supply to ensure compliance with water quality standards the council would like to thank the public for their support
8674072 landfill tax is now clearly too high and a disproportionate burden it is also leading to a significant inconvenience for residents across the country and should be cut
8674073 our politicians need to get a grip on public spending and bring down taxes and stop trying to disguise tax hikes through environmental rhetoric
8674074 the issue with us is not so much how high the landfill tax is but what happens to the landfill tax revenues afterwards our main problem is that it goes to the coffers of the treasury rather than being invested back into local authority recycling services
8674075 we are providing incentives for business to reduce waste through increases to landfill tax that will see government charges for dumping waste double between 2007 08 and 2010 11 http www typepad com t trackback 2443942 32846190

8674086 a few years ago i received an invitation to a bdsm dungeon club here in town
8674087 no for a private dungeon it sounded a bit too public for my taste i also found the list of protocols a bit rigid though i suppose in a social setting a code of conduct is necessary to ensure no ones toes get stepped on
8674088 i thought you liked rules and discipline or is that only when youre the one calling the shots
8674089 not from that club specifically im wondering if there might be similar groups that offer private access to their facilities

8674108 u k citizens are at the mercy of the ever increasing tendency of overseas prosecutors to extend their jurisdiction to crimes allegedly committed in this country
8674109 the message is clear if you hack into computers you have to realize that the legal consequences could be severe others should take note of mckinnons predicament and ask themselves do i want to end up in his situation

8674151 the rv book is marketed and sold through our rv education 101 website and through several top retailers including wal mart camping world super centers and rvbookstore com
8674152 the rv book is a comprehensive book that should absolutely be required reading at the very least before purchasing an rv and for sure after the purchase i have it listed as a staff favorite on my website i knew back when rv education 101 just started that marks expert rv information would be successful in the industry marks dvds and books have been steady sellers on my sites from the beginning
8674153 buying an rv is a major investment and a new rver can be overwhelmed when just starting out what type of rv is right for me how do i tow or drive an rv how do i safely use an rv how do i take care of my new rv i have gathered and researched all of the information into one place to simplify the entire process of rv ownership for them i just never thought it would be so successful though

8674169 extension 720 show with milt rosenberg at 312 591 7200
8674170 data from european demographers and statistical bureaus show that a majority of children in sweden and norway are now born out of wedlock as are 60 percent of first born children in denmark
8674171 kurtzs argument which oreilly embraces is that when legal rights are accorded to gays through some unspecified process heterosexual couples begin bearing children out of wedlock and refuse to marry when they otherwise would there are many government policies that alter the incentives to get and stay married and thus have direct and unsurprising effects on marriage for instance the availability of no fault divorce leads to more divorces and laws providing the same rights for cohabitating heterosexual couples as married couples lead to fewer marriages as couples make private commitments to each other without seeking the imprimatur of the state but neither kurtz nor oreilly has provided a plausible justification for their belief that extending rights to gay couples harms heterosexual marriage

8674174 i think the vote of no confidence in lawrence summers is a wonderful thing harvard continues to discredit itself with the american public the faculty is trapped if summers resigns this extraordinary example of political correctness will come back to haunt harvard and the entire academy for years but if summers hangs on the faculty itself will have been humiliated checked by the very fact of public scrutiny either way harvard is tearing itself apart so long as the public simply writes of the academy the mice can play but the intense public scrutiny in this case puts the captains of political correctness into a no win situation like the closely watched susan estrich fiasco this battle is doing lasting damage to the cultural left as they say sunlight is the best disinfectant

8674178 the poor man we say hes so devoted to his flock the work is endless and he sacrifices himself so unstintingly but the word busy is the symptom not of commitment but of betrayal it is not devotion but defection the adjective embezzling to describe a banker it is an outrageous scandal a blasphemous affront hilary of tours diagnosed our pastoral busyness as irreligiosa sollicitudo pro deo a blasphemous anxiety to do gods work for him i and most pastors i believe become busy for two reasons both are ignoble i want to appear important significant what better way than to be busy the incredible hours the crowded schedule and the heavy demands on my time are proof to myself and to all who will notice that i am important i indolently let others decide what i will do instead of resolutely deciding myself i let people who do not understand the work of pastor write the agenda for my days work because i am too slipshod to write it myself we find ourselves frantically at the last minute trying to satisfy a half dozen different demands on our time none of which is essential to our vocation to stave off the disaster of disappointing someone but if i vainly crowd my day with conspicuous activity or let others fill my day with imperious demands i dont have time to do my proper work the work to which i have been called how can i lead people into the quiet place beside still waters if i am in perpetual motion how can i persuade a person to live by faith and not works if i have to juggle my schedule constantly to make everything fit into place

8674190 in a somewhat surprising move from a company that is used to holding its proprietary technologies close to its chest nvidia has announced that it is opening up a certified sli motherboard program for boards using the upcoming intel x58 chipset the x58 is intels core logic offering for nehalem bloomfield processors and many people wondered how nvidia would support sli on a platform for which they had admitted to not developing a chipset at first nvidia was pushing the use of their dedicated nforce 200 chip but have instead decided to open up the sli technology to x58 motherboards that meet certain nvidia requirements this leaves a lot of questions about nvidias previous sli statements how the pricing of the certification affects partners and if nvidias chipset business is truly at its end now

8674199 the use of cellphones and the internet through wireless technology wifi on board aircraft in sa is regulated by the sa caa
8674200 it has taken the view that our legislation does not allow the use of such technology while in flight and thus it is illegal to make use of cellphones and other unapproved transmitting devices saa was the first local airline to apply for our customers to use the flight mode of some cellphones but we were turned down
8674201 in the interim saa will once again approach the sa caa to allow the use of flight mode on current cellphones
8674202 if the technical departments within sa caa or members of the industry have not identified that there is a need for a change in regulations regarding the use of cellphones then the change would not be made
8674203 also if this is a global trend in the industry then such a directive will come from organisations such as the international civil aviation organisation in this case we will be forced to change the regulations as such

8674337 let me make it clear this is not a black campaign were going ecumenical rabbis priests women men because if you undercut anybodys voting rights you undercut everybodys voting rights i hope we are committed i hope that we dont just have a big showing in denver and not realize we have to go back to the trenches
8674338 they want to play the race card and we cant go for it first they say obamas too black then they want to ask us is he too white hes not too black hes not too white hes just right for america

8674347 dat weten we niet precies maar we weten wel dat ze vanaf 1 september zullen worden ingezet ze vliegen naar daar hoppend van basis naar basis zoveel mogelijk over internationale wateren op het einde zullen ze in de lucht worden bijgetankt door vs vliegtuigen het juiste parcours is natuurlijk niet gekend
8674348 het is een duidelijke koerswijziging tegenover de politiek van de vorige regering die had ook troepen in afghanistan libanon tsjaad enzoverder maar dat waren eerder tweedelijns opdrachten niet dat we daar blij om waren maar ze namen ten minste niet effectief deel aan gevechtssituaties zoals nu ondertussen zijn we al zo ver dat de crem zegt dat we in geval van nood de amerikanen mee zullen ondersteunen in hun war on terror
8674349 we moeten solidair zijn binnen de opdracht van de navo die in principe een defensieve organisatie is maar de navo is zich helemaal aan het omturnen tot een offensieve organisatie wat iets helemaal anders is dan waarvoor ze is opgericht dat is een eerste punt we vinden dat ons land uit de navo moet stappen zoals die nu handelt ten tweede solidair zijn ja maar die solidariteit heeft zijn grenzen en die grenzen worden in deze missie ruim overschreden dat belgische militairen helpen bij het opkuisen van clusterbommen in libanon daar kunnen we inkomen maar in afghanistan gaat het om een aanvalsoorlog onder leiding van de vs en gedirigeerd door de vs je hebt zelf gezien hoe het discours van de crem verhard is nadat hij in wasghington op bezoek was geweest
8674350 dat zegt de crem maar als je kijkt op het terrein en luistert naar analysten hoor je een heel ander verhaal de taliban hebben steeds grotere delen van het land onder controle ook de verenigde naties laten een heel ander geluid horen er vallen steeds meer burgerslachtoffers zegt de vn en hoe meer troepen we sturen hoe meer slachtoffers er vallen dat is ook logisch want we gaan daar bombarderen het is dus helemaal niet waar dat door intesiever militair optreden de taliban worden verzwakt dat is een illusie waar we ons op baseren om de vs militair bij te springen
8674351 neen want het zal achter gesloten deuren zijn en met geheimhouding het publieke debat dat wij in onze petitie eisen gaat toch wel verder dan een gesloten commissievergadering gelukkig zien we het debat stilletjesaan op gang komen onder meer dank zij onze acties en campagnes er is meer en meer aandacht in de pers en een aantal politici beginnen zich tegen de missie uit te spreken dat is wat we willen want de mensen w ten gewoonweg niet dat we in afghanistan in een oorlog betrokken worden en als ze het wel weten dan denken ze dat het om een humanitaire missie gaat tot we hen die f 16 tonen dan begrijpen ze natuurlijk dat dat een drogreden is

8674446 nasa has received interesting results from the fermi gamma ray space telescope originally known as glast which has allowed them to create new map of the gamma ray sky the secret to its ability to resolve gamma rays is that they use layers of tungsten interleaved with silicon detectors when a gamma ray strikes tungsten it produces an electron positron pair due to the photoelectric effect which cascades as it goes through further layers of tungsten meanwhile they record which silicon detectors had electrons or positrons pass through them to determine the direction of the source and they also record the total energy of the electron positron pairs to calculate the wavelength of the gamma ray using plancks law the data gathered in just its first few hours of operation is reportedly comparable to the data from the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope which gathered data for nine years back in the 1990s and there are hopes that it could detect dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles wimps

8674544 now 40 yard dash away dash away dash away all
8674545 it is very hard to find a good job here that pays you well marriage is not cheap
8674546 it is much easier for a christian palestinian to get a visa to a western country than a muslim palestinian
8674547 so because it is easier they are able to leave
8674548 we all believe that we are palestinians first but when we have islamic groups like hamas in gaza taking control the rest of the world thinks palestinian liberation is an islamic cause
8674549 while i do not back the hamas led government in gaza our movement is a nationalistic one and it will always be about freeing palestine of this horrendous israeli occupation
8674550 we came with a tour group and if we like the sights we are shown then we will definitely come back more often
8674551 but we need to remember muslims and christians live among each other in bethlehem and other palestinian areas peacefully and not one of our guests was ever treated in way that shows they are not welcome to bethlehem
8674552 the israelis now not only occupy us but they run things they want to take our business
8674553 the occupation is part of our life whether we like it or not so we must find the beauty in the simple things life has to offer us
8674554 for me working where jesus was born is my way of handling the occupation
8674555 a vida seria muito mais f cil se pud ssemos vencer sempre mas s vezes as coisas n o acontecem do jeito que queremos nessas horas n o podemos chorar pelo leite derramado o que aconteceu j passado e temos de olhar adiante ainda n o acabou

8674557 the biggest advantage is that the field authentication of the product the determination that a product is genuine or counterfeit is done on the spot there is a lot of time saving for our investigations instead of bringing the product back getting it analysed we can know then and there is counterfeit and take immediate action
8674558 within the next two years we will see the emergence of this technology taking a really good foot hold in the three sections of pharma consumer goods and documentation it will also provide psychological deterrence for retailers to sell bogus products because they know that they can be caught on the spot

8674563 we recognise there is an urgent need for industry and government to collaborate to enable people to connect to the internet
8674564 the internet is capable of transforming lives and the future of our country through the connected indians movement we hope to achieve precisely that
8674565 the connected indians movement will bring with it rapid broadband deployment and help harness the powers of internet to accelerate inclusive social and economic change

8674591 we are as poor as the people of color we get treated as poorly as the people of color we dont have the economic standing required by our own people to honor us so how can we be considered better or how can we be accused of having oppressed them when we are oppressed ourselves
8674592 well the reason that i am listening to my feelings now is because they are the voice of my soul
8674593 hopefully this is the last time well have to demolish a neighborhood in order to save it
8674594 one summer day in 1998 a childhood neighbor nia knows as cowboy stopped by and pulled out a proclamation honoring his late mother henrietta lacks the proclamation explained how after lacks died at hopkins in 1951 the hospital took some of her cells and eventually developed a culture thats still used in medical research worldwide today the cells were used with neither the womans nor her familys permission two years later when redmond attended the first meeting announcing the east baltimore development biotech plan she held a copy of the lacks proclamation in the air and called for naming the new biotech park after henrietta lacks but her request carried no more weight than her other laments about hopkins recounting the incident now a tear crosses redmonds cheek she wonders if her community will suffer a fate similar to lacks who still lies in a grave without a headstone

8674611 atlanta is a good place to start a security company
8674612 theres more loyalty and you can focus on building a company
8674613 its like an alarm system in your house its something that is a must have regardless of what the economy looks like
8674614 there is still a lot more work to do to make the internet safe from mobile commerce
8674615 despite the economic conditions cybercrime is up and the need for security is high
8674616 we have seen virtually no slowdown in fact our business has accelerated in this economy
8674617 the folks i want to bring on all of them are here
8674618 we are the catalyst for the ideas but then the talent takes the ideas and creates solutions that is what attracts the venture capital and things like that
8674619 we do more and more important valuable things over the internet but the trends keep evolving the bad guys are smart
8674620 most of the money was made after ibm bought iss
8674621 it really justified the market oh we see we can make money off of these deals lets do them
8674622 you have these early companies that are pretty successful and they produce local expertise and people who are willing to invest in something
8674623 its clear that the second quarter not only wasnt a recession quarter it was actually a very robust quarter
8674624 this number seems to overstate the underlying strength even though exports are obviously strong
8674625 police in indianapolis will test a new tool that will allow officers to gather dna from handguns at a crime scene reports the indianapolis star
8674626 this device has the potential to increase arrests and the prosecution of individuals who commit gun crimes in our area
8674627 we would have expected to read something like this in the onion fortunately for us its true unfortunately for obama its true
8674628 weve done britneys sets and a whole bunch of rock shows but this was far more elaborate and complicated and we had to do it in far less time
8674629 the biggest challenge has been making sure we dont damage the playing field underneath
8674630 we knew about it for only a few weeks and had only one week to actually assemble this
8674631 shooting barbs about the opulence of our convention from the mountaintop in sedona
8674632 if you ask me it kind of looks like the columns in the white house
8674633 hes going to lay out the case for change hes going to set the stakes for this election the risks of continuing down the road were on
8674634 its going to be brilliant all the judges can wear black tie and well have a live orchestra there are some great songs for the finalists to choose from
8674635 everyone is excited about it lets face it simon would make an ideal blofeld cheryl would be perfect as pussy galore dannii could be vesper lynd and of course louis would be miss moneypenny
8674636 can the people of a territory constitutionally exclude slavery from their limits
8674637 there can be no moral right in connection with one man making a slave of another
8674638 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
8674639 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8674640 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8674641 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8674642 the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8674643 but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years
8674644 millions of veterans and americans would be surprised and disappointed to find out that sen mccain has received failing grades from some of our nations most respected veterans organizations
8674645 he has repeatedly voted against increases in health care funding and benefits for his fellow veterans
8674646 the fact is our veterans cant afford more of the same from john mccain
8674647 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8674648 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8674649 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8674650 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8674651 i move sen barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8674652 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
8674653 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8674654 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven

8674675 as he tried to campaign for his wife i think in the heat of the campaign he made some verbal mistakes
8674676 i made plenty of them when i was running for president too so i dont blame him for it but i think in some of his remarks he has hurt his wifes candidacy
8674677 i would like also for obama to say since im interested in middle east that from the beginning of my administration well begin to work for peace for israel and justice for the palestinians
8674678 whereas in the previous period the presidents have waited until the last year because its a very controversial issue
8674679 i think hes dramatically changed in the last few months
8674680 he was for the separation of church and state and now hes in bed with the right wing religious groups that might help him get elected as president he was against off shore drilling until right lately when the oil companies got to him and said youve got to do this
8674681 i dont now what hell do as president because we dont know which john mccain might be elected was it the one that existed in 2000 or in his previous history as a senator or is it the john mccain weve seen of the last few months as hes tried to reach out to the most radical and conservative elements of the republican party
8674682 hes been a member of the armed services committee working hand in hand with vice presidential nominee joe biden and with the great republican leaders as well i never had that opportunity so he has a lot more experience in dealing from a national perspective with defense matters and in international foreign affairs
8674683 on september 11 2007 the palins son track joined the army
8674684 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
8674685 yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
8674686 what is going to happen when they grow up what is going to happen when i am gone
8674687 what does a v p do on a daily basis
8674688 did you notice the song the obama campaign played at the end of president clinotns speech
8674689 im just going to hide in this paper bag until death comes
8674690 you think i should have a hobby while i wait
8674691 that speech was amazing but its not going to change my mind
8674692 i talk to plenty of people like me who just wont accept an unqualified president
8674693 obama has said a lot of stuff but nothing with a concrete vision
8674694 i have heard at least some sensible things from senator mccain hes a comeback kind of guy and ive heard from many other people who are clearly leaning in his direction
8674695 had it been a different republican democrats would not have been able to consider defecting so easily
8674696 but given the perception that mccain is a moderate there is a good chance that some clinton supporters will defect to him
8674697 went out of his way to undermine criticism of the legislation
8674698 biden was a fairly strong proponent of that bankruptcy bill
8674699 barack obama and joe biden have real solutions for struggling families in danger of losing their homes because of the bush economy and abusive lending practices

8674724 the transport workers union the airlines biggest labor group and the one seen as most friendly toward management took out advertisements to blame company leaders for the lack of a new labor contract and picking open an old sore the union criticized american for giving stock based compensation to executives while thousands of rank and file workers face layoffs
8674725 says the payments totaling more than 250 million over the last three years to several hundred managers are part of their compensation and are not bonuses
8674726 it is disappointing that the twu has taken this approach to the current contract negotiations
8674727 are not part of the association of flight attendants cwa
8674728 are required to be dismissed before any union members can be furloughed the union said
8674729 flight attendants appear to be standing firm with the pilots in their opposition to united managements running of the airline
8674730 the association of flight attendants said that united attendants would be furloughed on oct 31 the company will ask for volunteers before implementing mandatory furloughs
8674731 we encourage everyone who can afford to volunteer for a furlough to please do so as it will reduce the number of flight attendants who potentially face an involuntary furlough

8674740 to showcase your work you need a stellar web site and if a newspaper doesnt have that you cant be stuck in the 20th century with your old newspaper

8674742 i dont think either paper sun times or chicago tribune is going to survive
8674743 when i was growing up i understood that this was the work of the catholic church
8674744 there is a sense on the part of a lot of catholic social justice groups that catholic social justice issues are not well understood in the public square and have been eclipsed in the values debate
8674745 we feel very strongly that there are a number of organizations and individuals with no ties to the church who are using the teaching on abortion as a wedge
8674746 we want to have a more robust and productive conversation about what it means to be pro life reflecting the fullness of church teachings

8674752 the answer is that while the mailbox server role is supported in a virtual environment and customers are permitted to do it we generally recommend customers run mailbox servers on physical hardware

8674764 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8674765 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8674766 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse

8674959 our findings suggest that increased brain connections during chronic drug use may actually limit behavioral changes associated with drug addiction rather than support them
8674960 relapse or the resumption of active drug taking and drug seeking is very common in drug addicts
8674961 addiction related brain changes and behaviors seem to be hardwired and semipermanent and there are limited treatment options our data suggest that rather than trying to block the process of increasing dendritic spine density we may actually want to look at treatments that try to enhance this process

8674963 if we understand which genes are influenced by mef2 we can intervene and try to help the system resist or reverse these sensitization processes

8674966 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable
8674967 house speaker nancy pelosi misrepresented the history and nature of the authentic teaching of the catholic church against abortion
8674968 diminished the unique evil of abortion as an attack on life itself and the early church closely associated abortion with infanticide in short from the beginning the believing christian community held that abortion was always gravely wrong
8674969 catholics who make excuses for it whether theyre famous or not fool only themselves and abuse the fidelity of those catholics who do sincerely seek to follow the gospel and live their catholic faith
8674970 a new human individual comes into being from the union of sperm and egg at fertilization
8674971 in keeping with this modern understanding the church teaches that from the time of conception fertilization each member of the human species must be given the full respect due to a human person beginning with respect for the fundamental right to life
8674972 as fellow catholics and legislators we wish you pelosi would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
8674973 your subsequent remarks mangle catholic church doctrine regarding the inherent sanctity and dignity of human life therefore we are compelled to refute your error
8674974 to reduce the scandal and consternation caused amongst the faithful by your remarks we necessarily write you to correct the public record and affirm the churchs actual and historical teaching that defends the sanctity of human life
8674975 we now report evidence that restoration of the functioning of the stress axis may be the key to how these new antidepressant approaches might work
8674976 these findings lend weight to the hope that crf1 antagonists might play a role in the treatment of antidepressant resistant symptoms of depression or posttraumatic stress disorder if so crf1 antagonists could fulfill an important unmet need we urgently need to find ways to help the large number of patients who fail to respond adequately to our available treatments
8674977 is offering a high risk test that has not received adequate clinical validation and may harm the public health
8674978 these funds are not an annuity with a guaranteed lifetime return
8674979 cold when i am denied it your light is ultraviolet
8674980 who am i and what exactly am i doing here how do i want my life to look now
8674981 lets just say i hope lindsay starts opening her eyes and realizes who the people using her are

8674983 here is this cool thing you can adapt to your needs see ya

8674988 amazing workshop i will highly recommend this to everyone all three speakers were fantastic and really knew their stuff and i loved the mixing up the sessions with different speakers to allow us to get different perspectives thanks very much i am starting to migrate an application to mach ii tonight
8674989 shimmering dazzling nearly blinding brightness that made me cover my eyes with my hands
8674990 tissue had regenerated to the point where you cannot only not tell that there was ever any cancer there but you cant tell that there had been any surgery there
8674991 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
8674992 little exposure to traditional moral teaching and limited accountability for such behavior
8674993 the only way to be assured of not catching anything is not to do it
8674994 promiscuity is not a good way to live its not a healthy way to live
8674995 its not a morally healthy way to live and the students here have been willing to make that argument not only to their fellow students but to the administration
8674996 whats impressive about princeton is that so many students have been involved in actively opposing the hookup culture
8674997 promiscuity is not a good way to live its not a healthy way to live its not a morally healthy way to live and the students here have been willing to make that argument not only to their fellow students but to the administration
8674998 have had little exposure to traditional moral teaching and limited accountability for such behavior
8674999 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
8675000 as a scientist i know not believe know that human life begins at conception
8675001 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
8675002 theres an understandable reluctance to address these issues in public forums
8675003 middle of the road voters think of him in this kind of nebulous maverick way and they dont associate him with the very strong conservative culture war issues
8675004 both obama and mccain have said they want to reach out to the middle
8675005 abortions not something you talk about when youre trying to win the center
8675006 obama wants to address social issues in a way that tries to take the sharp edge off the wedge
8675007 i am absolutely convinced that the culture wars are so 90s
8675008 were tired of arguing about the same old stuff and i am convinced we can win that argument
8675009 mccain doesnt seem to have any particular enthusiasm for talking about this stuff
8675010 my answer is its not the reason why im running for president of the united states
8675011 im sure that there will be millions of people of faith for whom these moral issues will have a dominant place
8675012 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven
8675013 we did not want to take any chances and posted her for an elective caesarean in most artificial reproductive procedures we opt for the caesarean section due to various reasons
8675014 with weak steering currents all sorts of things can happen
8675015 everybody learned a lesson about staying so the highways will be twice as packed this time
8675016 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8675017 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8675018 we might see oil prices spike 5 to 8 if it really rips into platforms
8675019 im not going to worry about it until i see it in the gulf
8675020 during your lifetime you will have a lot of pleasures but with all of the pleasures you have there will be just a few outstanding things that give you the greatest amount of happiness 1 the day you marry the person you will love for the remainder of your life 2 the day you are blest with children of your own 3 the day your grandchildren start arriving to me these are the greatest and most important events of anyones life sure having money a big house shiny new car will give you pleasure but they are not nearly as important as the love of your partner and your children
8675021 she was six years overdue but she finally arrived at our house on december 18 just four days old weighing 6 pounds 1 2 ounce shes a doll and shall be known as kimberly ann we hope your christmas was as happy as ours
8675022 your faith and upbringing made you hope for this day you just were never sure when it would come
8675023 you know i attended segregated schools our teachers taught us about this day they didnt know when it would happen but they taught us about it the taught us about booker t washington and w e b dubois they were teaching us about a movement to a better america
8675024 this is a great moment we dont give ourselves credit for how far weve come
8675025 i will see her when she visits this fall i will tell her about this day she wont understand it all but she will remember that i talked to her about it
8675026 i will tell her that no matter how this turns out this is a day to always remember

8675029 como las cosas se acostumbran a hacer a medias solo se construy un 60 que con el tiempo ya est en malas condiciones el restante que es un 40 espero terminarlo como alcalde mi trabajo estar enfocado a la modernizaci n y potenciaci n cultural de nuestra isla
8675030 quiero ser un candidato cercano a mi gente y sus costumbres aunque tambi n tengo la fuerte convicci n de que rapa nui necesita crecer por el desarrollo del futuro de nuestros isle os y sus hijos
8675031 el actual alcalde lleva 4 periodos gobernando creo que petero alcalde ya est cansado es momento de un cambio que de nuevos aires a nuestra gente
8675032 para mi eso es continuismo mas de lo mismo ya basta ejemplo de esto son las calles que est n terriblemente malas no se reparan hace mucho tiempo y no queremos m s de lo mismo en la isla
8675033 hay problemas de extracci n de la basura es m s a mi personalmente hace 2 a os que el cami n no me retira la basura en la casa uno hace un tr mite en la municipalidad y casi siempre no hay nadie es un desorden y no hay control
8675034 mi idea es de hacer un cambio a la gesti n municipal ordenar primero el municipio y entregar un mejor servicio a la comunidad queremos generar proyectos puesto que la municipalidad de la isla por estar exenta de impuestos no genera recursos propios y tenemos que conformarnos con lo que sobra de la 5ta regi n

8675039 the standout recommendation would be that the present test is flawed and seen by some as intimidatory and by others as discriminatory and needs a substantial reform
8675040 it is designed not as some kind of trivial pursuit but to ensure that people do understand and have a working capacity in the national language which is english
8675041 many of the submissions thought that the standard of english required was too high and discriminated against non english speaking migrants of which there are of course an increasing number

8675044 ive been waiting for transformers to be released on blu ray for a long time and it was worth the wait
8675045 this is the complete high definition package for fans of the film it looks stunning and really allows you to engage with this movie in new ways
8675046 its certainly been a difficult year but buying out a partner is never an easy thing
8675047 the landscape for the blu ray format is very healthy and we believe that the enhanced movie experiences that the format provides such as disneys bd live network offers consumers the chance to reinvent the experience of watching movies in their home and the interactivity and connectivity that is being provided will truly make the family room relevant again
8675048 the network music player will be the cd player of the 21st century and squeezebox boom is the first player in its class to deliver high quality audio in a compact all in one design
8675049 he who has an ear to hear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches
8675050 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8675051 these decisions illustrate once again that game piracy will not be tolerated and the extent at which these criminals will be prosecuted the esa and its members will continue to support law enforcements efforts to protect the intellectual property of our industry
8675052 as soon as our sneakers touched the track one of my friends went zipping off a long distance runner at heart i took a much slower steady approach i was lapped within the first few minutes like an undesirable birthday spanking the lapping didnt seem to have an end

8675061 it started off as a snowball and ended up as an avalanche we couldnt get the stock to cope
8675062 normally im out exercising my dogs but i didnt have the energy for it
8675063 ill try any other medication provided my poor little miserable budget can cope with it im an old girl and i cant really afford it but i have got to live

8675074 what genes do you have to turn on for the cell to become a beta cell
8675075 if you want to do reprogramming it doesnt take great insight to figure out that the key genes are transcription factors the proteins that bind dna and tell cells which genes to turn on and which to turn off

8675079 use this function to generate a persistent identifier in a distributed environment to a very high degree of certainty this function returns a unique value no other invocation on the same or any other system returns the same value
8675080 no as a matter of fact muhammed lived in the desert
8675081 although the prophets advice was sound and applicable to the time in which he lived allah in his infinite wisdom knew that there would come later medical and scientific advances which would make the prophets advice appear outdated when later discoveries occurred people might say that such information contradicted that which the prophet had given thus since allah would never allow any opportunity for the non muslims to claim that the quran contradicts itself or the teachings of the prophet he only included in the quran information and examples which could stand the test of time
8675082 i was so afraid that i ran home to my wife
8675083 if you have theory do not bother us with it unless you bring with that theory a way for us to prove whether you are wrong or not
8675084 1 believe the universe works like this and here are three ways to prove whether 1 m wrong
8675085 this is my idea and if you want to try to prove me wrong do this or try that
8675086 if this book is not what it claims to be then all you have to do is this or this or this to prove that it is false
8675087 is there any falsification test in your religion is there anything in your religion that would prove you are wrong if i could prove to you that it exists anything
8675088 this exam is perfect there are no mistakes in it find one if you can
8675089 if you want to know more about this or that or if you doubt what is said then you should ask those who have knowledge
8675090 here is what the quran says is it the truth
8675091 this is what the quran says about your subject is it true what can you tell us
8675092 dont you think that maybe the arabs might have known about these things the description of the embryo its appearance and how it changes and grows maybe there were not scientists but maybe they did something crude dissections on their own carved up people and examined these things
8675093 it does not matter if someone had tried to discover embryology fourteen centuries ago they could not have seen it
8675094 maybe fourteen centuries ago someone secretly had a microscope and did this research making no mistakes anywhere then he somehow taught muhammad and convinced him to put this information in his book then he destroyed his equipment and kept it a secret forever do you believe that you really should not unless you bring some proof because it is such a ridiculous theory
8675095 this is not new we know where muhammad got this information we learned this at school
8675096 1 am going to go home tonight and find a mistake in the quran
8675097 congratulations that is the most intelligent thing that you have said
8675098 this book is a divine revelation if you do not believe that then what is it
8675099 one thing we know for sure that man muhammad thought he was a prophet he was crazy
8675100 because of this evidence one thing we know for sure is that that man muhammad was a liar
8675101 how will i fool the people tomorrow so that they think i am a prophet
8675102 if it came from his head then where did he get the information contained in it certainly the quran mentions many things with which the arabs were not familiar
8675103 well maybe he was not crazy maybe some foreigner brought him the information so he lied and told people that he was a prophet
8675104 if muhammad was a liar then where did he get his confidence why did he behave as though he really thought he was a prophet
8675105 if muhammad was a liar where did he get his confidence why did he tell some people out right to their face what others could never say
8675106 what did he tell you did he say black well its white did he say morning well its night
8675107 1 heard that it has been revealed to muhammad that 1 will never change that 1 will never become a muslim and will enter the hellfire well 1 want to become a muslim now how do you like that what do you think of your divine revelation now
8675108 you hate me and you want to finish me here say these words and 1 am finished come on say them
8675109 hey abu bakr see if you can find a back way out of this cave
8675110 squat down in that corner over there and keep quiet
8675111 relax allah is with us and allah will save us
8675112 well 1 tell you if that book is not the bible it was written by a man
8675113 let me tell you something about what is in that book
8675114 you are right a man did not write that book the devil wrote it
8675115 oh if 1 had been there 1 would not have been as stupid as the jews
8675116 oh the devil did it the devil wrote that book
8675117 and they say surely he is possessed byjinn but it i
8675118 so when you recite the quran seek refuge in allah from shaytaan the rejected
8675119 before you read my book ask god to save you from me
8675120 o k you say you are the king of england so tell me where the queen is today and where is your prime minister and where are your guards
8675121 oh mankind there has come to you an admonition i
8675122 oh mankind you say such and such about this but what about such and such how can you say this when you know that
8675123 over the centuries many theories have been offered as to the origin of the quran today no sensible man accepts any of these theories
8675124 oh the quran came from here the quran came from there
8675125 do not listen to these unconfirmed reports about the quran
8675126 show me one deception show me where the quran deceives me show me otherwise dont say that it is a deception
8675127 do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together then we clove them asunder and made from water every living thing
8675128 all of this you see pointing to yourself is made up of mostly water
8675129 ive no idea whats going on its very hard to get communication with some people in life
8675130 clearly theres not long to go youll have to wait with bated breath
8675131 i have said to the captain and the coach what my feelings are and i dont really want to say them in public
8675132 at the end of the day i was looking more long term in the winter and getting ready for the test series
8675133 i didnt envisage coming back to play in this series which makes it awkward but that is a bit down the line if i am picked for that game there is not much i can do about it
8675134 at the moment we have three games to win and if we do win that will be important for this england team as we head to antigua and into the winter
8675135 i am available from now to play every one day international and twenty20 for england
8675136 i did have eyes on playing one day cricket but i obviously wasnt quite there
8675137 then i got a phone call when i was putting the kids to bed at two oclock on the thursday i could still hear the lads in the nets
8675138 both peter moores and kev told me to come back and play we need somebody we need a favour will you come and bowl
8675139 i said i would come and play until the end of the series and see what happens then and ive enjoyed it
8675140 the family reasons were not the only reason i packed in
8675141 it was one of the main reasons but it wasnt the whole thing
8675142 i packed it in for cricketing reasons i wasnt bowling very well and was not enjoying my cricket
8675143 the family thing didnt help but the family is a lot more stable now i have four kids and i dont envisage having any more
8675144 at the end of the day it is two months away but i would be two months away anyway because i would have to go to south africa and then on to play the test matches
8675145 i might as well do the bowling in the one day series and be a part of what ive missed
8675146 going away to south africa to play four day matches to get ready for the test match or playing one day cricket for england was really a no brainer
8675147 this period out of the spotlight has probably been the best thing for me because i have bowled a lot of overs this year
8675148 england is probably one of the hardest places to try and earn a living
8675149 id been over there for 10 years but i just thought the time was right i know ricki herbert and i know a lot of the lads here ricki contacted me and id been wanting to come home for a while now im just glad to be here
8675150 ive known jeremy christie since i was a kid he was telling me great things about the club and he wasnt telling lies
8675151 its a strong squad too obviously weve not had a good result last week but hopefully this week will be better
8675152 it is hard to watch the boys training each day while im running on the track but theyd been training for three months and ive had to get fit and hopefully i can be involved at the weekend adelaide look a good team but weve just got to work for ourselves
8675153 i started talking to the warriors about six or seven weeks ago
8675154 its a good opportunity to hopefully have a real crack at the halfback position
8675155 i was talking to a few clubs but ive got a lot of family back in new zealand so moving over there was important to me
8675156 ive really enjoyed those few games and obviously im hungry for more top level football
8675157 cooper cronks taught me a lot about organisation and thats the strongest part i think of his game how he directs everyone round the field
8675158 ive tried taking a leaf out of his book its something ive been concentrating on and trying to put into my game
8675159 i know that theres been a fair bit of criticism over the halves but it is a tough position and you do cop a lot of stick because it is so important
8675160 im just going to come over train my best and listen and learn and hopefully if given the chance i can really grab it with two hands
8675161 im really looking forward to that thats something i asked ivan cleary and john hart was stacey jones going to be fulltime next year and they said he was so im really excited about coming back home and working with a legend
8675162 watching the warriors when i was young i was a warriors fan and he was always my favourite player
8675163 he has represented to the us that he is residing in australia in australia he asserts that he is only residing in australia from july26 2002
8675164 i am instructed that the acc would consider any communication or other action which had the effect of identifying the non lpp legal professional privilege documents to your clients in any way as a breach of the offence provisions contained in section 29b of the australian crime commission act 2002
8675165 i am instructed that such a breach of s29b would be referred to the commonwealth director of public prosecutions
8675166 the issue relevantly grounding the accs cox amp railton claim is the steps taken by hogan with the assistance of stewart to misrepresent his tax residency status to authorities in australia and the us for the purpose of avoiding liability to taxation
8675167 having successfully defended stewart and hogan previously known as mm amp dd v acc the acc took the view that there was no longer any benefit in continuing the hogan proceedings
8675168 this matter does not affect the accs wider operation wickenby investigations in relation to tax fraud tax evasion and money laundering which are being pursued successfully to the fullest extent of the law
8675169 the burden of proof required to be satisfied by the acc is a low one
8675170 the obvious answer to the dems successful mantra of mccain bush is for mccain to choose as his vp get this joe lieberman
8675171 as a listed company in canada mega cannot continue to invest in projects jurisdictions in which it has little or no chance of a return
8675172 as such the company is reviewing its entire australian uranium portfolio with a view to reinvesting its exploration and development spending in jurisdictions in which it can ensure a return to shareholders
8675173 one of the things wed look at would be the misrepresentation claim this investment climate and opportunity for uranium was there but now has been taken away
8675174 any ban on uranium mining is simply not sustainable because the counter argument for its use is too strong
8675175 it was involved in businesses in south america that werent travelling the way they hoped and instead of revealing the true state of its business to themarket it chose to fudge
8675176 it reinforces the fact that in australia we can enforce the continuous disclosure provisions of the corporations act in a commercially viable way
8675177 treating the staff as their friends instead of their enemies
8675178 i think the reason for it the union criticism is that those individuals from one or two unions are locked into a view of equity which doesnt work
8675179 but i think weve got to put ancient debates behind us which are purely about throwing resources at one end of the system without measuring the results at the other end of the system
8675180 we are concerned that there is a group of communities a group of young australians who are in a grave grave danger of being left behind
8675181 plainly you are going to have some people in the unions who are going to go for us big time that is a matter for them
8675182 all we are seeking from the government is the evidence from experience in the us and the uk these are flawed models
8675183 ultimately in order to achieve the outcomes we want we need to ensure that our schools are properly funded
8675184 i dont support narrow league tables as they all too often distort both student progress and teacher achievement
8675185 but i dont think that is why the government is suggesting them either
8675186 costello is undeniably the liberal partys best political asset now that howard is gone
8675187 so much turns on whether he recovers the will to serve
8675188 mostly costello kept his disappointment in check refraining from the odd bitter comment would have been heroic virtue in a saint let alone an ambitious politician
8675189 he never challenged because he didnt want to wreck the government in order to lead it
8675190 we are going to celebrate the public life and recognise it so far of peter costello
8675191 that the grant of a criminal justice stay visa may be contrary to your decision to cancel dr haneefs visa under section 501 3 and as a consequence contrary to the national interest
8675192 this document raises the question that the minister was asking the department only to be told what he wanted to hear
8675193 the inquiry had asked him to attend and he did not attend
8675194 he provided his statement very late and he believed the inquiry should look at his statement before we interviewed him

8675197 rumours of the death of the australian economy are overdone
8675198 certainly there are economies around the globe skirting recession territory yet the outlook for the domestic economy remains robust
8675199 this data shows that many businesses are still confidently investing in future capacity despite the global economic downturn and 12 straight rate rises pushing up business costs
8675200 i would ask this question why is it that when there is positive economic data out there those opposite find no reason to embrace that in their argument at all
8675201 the abs conducted this survey in july and august and if ever you were going to see a downgrade from collapsing confidence youd have thought it would be now
8675202 to see a bigger than average upgrade tells you how robust the story is now
8675203 manufacturing is the weaker component but to see any sort of positive increase is a good result given higher interest rates weaker consumer spending and the strong dollar
8675204 the mining companies in western australia will be buying copper pipes for plumbing from manufacturers in victoria
8675205 this will be good for employment investment is one of the channels for the terms of trade benefits to be distributed throughout the economy and these numbers show it is working pretty well
8675206 it is possible that investment might remain surprisingly resilient given that much of it is concentrated in the resources sector which is still performing strongly and this will provide continued support for growth
8675207 indeed these data provide no support for the notion that firms will savagely slash their capital spending expectations
8675208 based on the advice and information that i have made my decision on including reports from the csiro and geosciences australia and further independent advice from the chief scientist i am satisfied that the tough conditions attached to this approval will ensure the highest standards of environmental management by the mine operator
8675209 one of those conditions is the requirement that heathgate resources implements a rigorous monitoring program to demonstrate they are meeting the agreed environmental outcomes
8675210 for instance i did oppose the change in policy at the party conference last year but i also made it clear that if it was the democratic will of the party that the three mines policy should change that i would support it

8675214 thats all well and good joe that obama said that but what has he then make the point that obamas been running for president since before he was elected to the senate and has missed half or more of the last 100 votes
8675215 i sincerely believe that banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity under the name of funding is but swindling futurity on a large scale
8675216 the system of banking i have ever reprobated i contemplate it as a blot left in all our constitutions which if not covered will end in their destruction which is already hit by the gamblers in corruption and is sweeping away in its progress the fortunes and morals of our citizens
8675217 the banks have the regulation of the safety valves of our fortunes and condense and explode them at their will
8675218 the incorporation of a bank and the powers assumed by legislation doing so have not in my opinion been delegated to the united states by the constitution they are not among the powers specially enumerated
8675219 the monopoly of a single bank is certainly an evil the multiplication of them was intended to cure it but it multiplied an influence of the same character with the first and completed the supplanting the precious metals by a paper circulation between such parties the less we meddle the better
8675220 in order to be able to meet a general combination of the banks against us in a critical emergency could we not make a beginning towards an independent use of our own money towards holding our own bank in all the deposits where it is received and letting the treasurer give his draft or note for payment at any particular place which in a well conducted government ought to have as much credit as any private draft or bank note or bill and would give us the same facilities which we derive from the banks
8675221 if treasury bills are emitted on a tax appropriated for their redemption in fifteen years and to insure preference in the first moments of competition bearing an interest of six per cent there is no one who would not take them in preference to the bank paper now afloat on a principle of patriotism as well as interest and they would be withdrawn from circulation into private hoards to a considerable amount their credit once established others might be emitted bottomed also on a tax but not bearing interest and if ever their credit faltered open public loans on which these bills alone should be received as specie these operating as a sinking fund would reduce the quantity in circulation so as to maintain that in an equilibrium with specie it is not easy to estimate the obstacles which in the beginning we should encounter in ousting the banks from their possession of the circulation but a steady and judicious alternation of emissions and loans would reduce them in time
8675222 bank paper must be suppressed and the circulating medium must be restored to the nation to whom it belongs it is the only fund on which they can rely for loans it is the only resource which can never fail them and it is an abundant one for every necessary purpose treasury bills bottomed on taxes bearing or not bearing interest as may be found necessary thrown into circulation will take the place of so much gold and silver which last when crowded will find an efflux into other countries and thus keep the quantum of medium at its salutary level let banks continue if they please but let them discount for cash alone or for treasury notes
8675223 put down the banks and if this country could not be carried through the longest war against her most powerful enemy without ever knowing the want of a dollar without dependence on the traitorous classes of her citizens without bearing hard on the resources of the people or loading the public with an indefinite burden of debt i know nothing of my countrymen not by any novel project not by an charlatanerie but by ordinary and well experienced means by the total prohibition of all private paper at all times by reasonable taxes in war aided by the necessary emissions of public paper of circulating size this bottomed on special taxes redeemable annually as this special tax comes in and finally within a moderate period
8675224 our people will give you all the necessaries of war they produce if instead of the bankrupt trash they now are obliged to receive for want of any other you will give them a paper promise funded on a specific pledge and of a size for common circulation
8675225 instead of funding issues of paper on the hypothecation of specific redeeming taxes the only method of anticipating in a time of war the resources of times of peace tested by the experience of nations we are trusting to tricks of jugglers on the cards to the illusions of banking schemes for the resources of the war and for the cure of colic to inflations of more wind
8675226 it is literally true that the toleration of banks of paper discount costs the united states one half their war taxes or in other words doubles the expenses of every war now think but for a moment what a change of condition that would be which should save half our war expenses require but half the taxes and enthral us in debt but half the time
8675227 with biodiesel we dont have to choose between food feed and fuel

8675248 takes a surprising turn away from what the conservative press would expect from head and his spiritual awakening and takes an in your face gritty but very honest look at the depths to which individuals will go to satisfy their drug alcohol addictions or other vices wrapped with footage of real life stories and overlayed with other innuendo heads performance steals the picture and will answer anyones questions as to whether he can still rock as hard or harder than his earlier days in korn the literal message in the final screen will get viewers thinking long and hard about any pre conceived judgments they have about those in society typically viewed as losers

8675258 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning

8675388 you have done what the cynics said we couldnt do
8675389 you came together as democrats republicans and independents to stand up and say that we are one nation we are one people and our time for change has come
8675390 you have to look at american culture and the fact that its been 400 years for these kind of racial attitudes to develop racial behaviors to materialize and youre certainly not going to wipe that out with just someone being elected to any office in the united states
8675391 i have never been so naive as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle or with a single candidacy particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own
8675392 when we passed civil rights bills in 64 and 65 and under lyndon johnson racial attitudes didnt change for a long time but over time as a result of those bills they changed dramatically and in the same way martin luther king didnt change peoples attitudes immediately but over time he had an enormous impact

8675395 on the most important policy decision of our time the war in iraq barack obama is right and john mccain is wrong very very wrong
8675396 thats why i left a job at a law firm for a career in public service working to empower young people to volunteer in their communities
8675397 the same way he always has by bringing us together and reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are
8675398 john mccain doesnt think that 47 million people without health insurance is a crisis
8675399 i will always remember the boy who told me his mom worked for the minimum wage and that her employer had cut her hours
8675400 even today as oil companies post the biggest profits in history john wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks
8675401 john mccain wants to cut taxes for companies that make delicious ice cream sundaes feed the puppies of toddlers and fix veterans wheelchairs

8675410 i feel like we just had a very fortuitous moment just the right person the right time the right part
8675411 he has a very empathetic spirit and it allows him to climb into the character from the inside out and in a kind of complete and authentic way hes so big hearted as a person that he can stand at the center of the story and the audience wants to climb in with him and thats such a gift
8675412 but they definitely put you in a box and my parents were very lenient and very open minded and let me explore for myself what i felt was right and wrong and they raised all their kids that way and none of us have problems with alcohol or drugs
8675413 silas is totally opposite of me and also not as smart as melchior
8675414 so silas is like the stupid version of not being me and melchior is like the smart intellectual version of not being me but i like doing that i like being able to play roles that are totally different from me

8675618 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
8675619 if my guess is right then it raises the suspicion that someone in the us specially created this conflict to worsen the situation and create an advantage in the competitive struggle for one of the candidates for the post of

8675630 2006 brings what he calls an unconventional post breakup love story
8675631 i chose the script because it was well written and i adore love stories but this is an unconventional romance and gives off a unique color
8675632 i cant believe that i have risen to play opposite jeon in such a short time frame
8675633 while playing her bodyguard in the drama there were many scenes where i was chauffeuring for her i remember one particular scene where she was crying and i was so moved i almost shed tears jeon is a great actress who inspires those around her even before the audience
8675634 i didnt know wed be cast together because of our age difference but jeong woo was able to come far because he was already a good actor back then
8675635 jeong woo is a very versatile actor and really supported me
8675636 when asked if the latter character a playboy who swindles women might be a repetition for his upcoming film he said no
8675637 while its true that both characters are very sleazy the moonlight of seoul is a bitter dark night story while my character in my dear enemy energized by the sun is cheerful and optimistic despite his recklessness
8675638 in trying to recreate the period i realized how little remains of the past because korea was so focused on economic development
8675639 unlike the black and white documentaries were familiar with 1930s gyeonseong was a thoroughly modern city very colorful with neon lights
8675640 which is set in the 1940s this particular period which had in the past been the subject of depressing documentaries becomes a backdrop for crafting rich exciting drama
8675641 the point here is not making a story about the colonial era but taking a character who could well exist in 2008 and displacing him in the past
8675642 i felt rather overwhelmed about playing a character in another time
8675643 he just wants to be happy but was born in the wrong era
8675644 said that sex appeal doesnt define her character who has at least nine identities from singer and dancer to fashion designer
8675645 shes a very talented woman who lived ahead of her time

8675648 all the procedures the town used in seeking to sell the quarry property for the primary purpose of flood mitigation
8675649 the property is being sold for what its worth on the tax roll
8675650 its not being sold at any discounted rate this is a distressed piece of used industrial land that very few people want
8675651 would further serve the goals and objectives of the towns master plan including the preservation and protection of open space scenic and environmental resources
8675652 reservoir needed to prevent future flooding and serve other general municipal purposes
8675653 let me just say that general municipal purposes does not normally include the sale of a property by a municipality to enormously enrich your political supporters in the developer community
8675654 the county absolutely did nothing wrong and the most important thing here is the county is already in a fiscal crisis and for the county legislator to sue his own county the cost is going to be put back to the taxpayers
8675655 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
8675656 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
8675657 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
8675658 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
8675659 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
8675660 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
8675661 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
8675662 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
8675663 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
8675664 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
8675665 the global economic downturn has caused a slowdown in the construction industry and the company must respond to this change in market conditions to protect the long term future of welsh slate and its employees
8675666 we will do everything possible to ensure that the necessary reduction in staffing numbers can be achieved through a voluntary redundancy programme and offer whatever support and assistance we can to staff during this difficult period
8675667 we were kind of expecting the news we could see that the product was not being sold and was piling up in the yard we werent expecting it to be as much as 50 redundancies though
8675668 we will try to get that figure down during the 30 day consultation with the company and we hope that most of the redundancies will be voluntary
8675669 we all understand what with the present economic climate it all just has a knock on effect

8675686 if that is true if that is confirmed then thats really bad its very dangerous and a mistaken policy
8675687 it that was the case then the recent events could have a american domestic political dimension
8675688 if my suspicions are confirmed in that case the suspicion arises that somebody in the united states has intentionally created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president
8675689 if that was the case its nothing less than the use of so called administrative resources in a domestic political fight in its worst bloody dimension
8675690 depression is a daily struggle and requires a lifestyle change with ongoing treatment i know that every single thing in relation to my body affects my mental health including nutrition exercise laughter hormones sleep alcohol consumption or lack of it prayer sugar and medication to name just a few we are proposing a concert so that we can share new information treatment options hope a new depression brand and famous musicians to share their music
8675691 i am continuously amazed at how few resources we put towards the brain when it is the most complex organ in the human body we are murdering ourselves more than others yet we hide it under the rug shadowed by shame what is happening that is making us turn against ourselves
8675692 we spend billions on wars across the globe and i wonder when we are going to spend that kind of money finding peaceful resolutions to the wars going on in the mind depression has taken the lives of many way too early wasted so many good years for others and it is time we understand why and encourage people to get treatment so they can improve the lives of all

8675701 it is the quickest way for scotland to disappear off the international stage
8675702 the official position of uefa indeed of fifa whose responsibility it is is that this has to be purely a football matter and nothing to do with world of politics
8675703 it is about the identity of the countries and it is a matter for the football associations
8675704 but when i was in scotland and chief executive of the scottish fa we had a clear and firm position and i understand that is still the position that scotland should not take part in an olympic gb team
8675705 when i was there which was not a long time ago those other countries had the same sort of feelings as we do
8675706 we have more than 100 years of history of competing as a separate national in football terms
8675707 it is not like other sports as scotland competes as a separate entity in all international football competitions
8675708 fife is comprised of 208 countries and we have had situations in the past when the privileges of the british associations one of which is to compete separately in international football tournaments has come under attack
8675709 i just wonder if the pressure of the situation will tell on llodra
8675710 andy is such a perfectionist and he is probably finding all this very frustrating he just has to concentrate on his own performance now and get the job done
8675711 good murray is under control again llodra has given his all i think and andy should finish him here
8675712 it has turned into an erratic match both players have had their moments but on the whole it has not been particularly pretty
8675713 murray seems to have steadied the ship a little but he is still far from looking like a number six seed
8675714 we were hoping murray would be in command by now but instead we are dead level
8675715 murray wont lose he just has to wake up and i think he is starting to get into the game now
8675716 thats the sampras way get a routine first set then introduce some drama by inexplicably capitulating in the second no wait
8675717 murrays second serve are nowhere near good enough level at this level and they will be punished they seem to be getting shorter and shorter too
8675718 murray looks a little bit too patient and passive at the moment llodra looks composed and confident these are alarming moments for the sixth seed
8675719 murray has got to dig a little deeper that first set was so controlled he though he could come out and pick up where he left off but llodra is too good a player
8675720 murray does not want to try to be too clever the intensity wasnt there for him in that game that should be a wake up call for him
8675721 thats the sampras way get the early break and hold hold hold till you win the set good start now sustain it
8675722 only the single break but it was all he needed murray takes the first set and he has barely broken sweat
8675723 not much drama in this match so far it has been more about mistakes than winners
8675724 murray will be very happy sitting back on the baseline playing rallies because he knows he will come out on top in most of them
8675725 you have to hope this is going to be straightforward for murray anything more than three sets is wasted energy hopefully hell put llodra away quickly
8675726 i have been working on the album for a long time and its almost finished now the album will carry songs that i wrote myself because its an asian special album there will also be an english version

8675728 tecktonik is a dance not a fashion or music style it has been popular in europe and finally hit korea last year
8675729 i remember the dance becoming popular around the hongik university a few years ago there was tecktonik and shuffle dance tecktonik didnt have a name back then while shuffle dancing was a kind of dance that used the lower body particularly the feet
8675730 i found a video called koreas tell me the popular song and dance by girl group wonder girls and frances tecktonik almost a year ago being interested in dance i watched it and was amazed wanting to bring the trend here i started to search for other tecktonik videos
8675731 the important thing about tecktonik is that it can be improvised learn the basic steps and you can change and develop it any way you would like other dances require continuous practice and memorizing but tecktonik is different its like starting an engine after the basic steps are done you can go anywhere with it
8675732 if you think about it the reason is simple dancing all night at clubs can be exhausting and this form of dance was more simple than using your whole body its easier to enjoy
8675733 who first brought it here nobody will know for sure it started at clubs and was recognized and picked up by entertainment agencies singers and other trendsetters now it has become an overall trend for almost everything
8675734 after we carried out our marketing including the tecktonik trend we saw a great increase in our colorful high top shoes sales
8675735 we decided to use tecktonik in our commercials in may we knew it was a huge trend in europe and it was perfect for our new cosmetic line which carries vivid and glittery colors after the commercial we have been receiving calls for information about the products
8675736 electro house is considered the best its perfect to dance to because it has a bpm beats per minute of 125 to 130 not that fast but not too slow either its groovy stylish and works well with the dance
8675737 one important contributor of course was the internet with numerous uccs user created content and videos
8675738 for a trend to become popular these days there are two important factors it must be easy to encounter and participate in and people should have the chance to create their own versions giving them the space to express themselves tecktonik in this case includes both people can easily participate by simply watching video clips on the internet and they can also create new moves without the help of a professional dancer
8675739 i want to share tecktonik with everybody so i started to upload videos of me dancing it on my web page the internet was a door that introduced me to tecktonik and now im sharing my moves with fans im also planning to visit france and share ideas with the locals there

8675795 the high point for me was the day in 1986 i did a grandstand show and told a long lake wobegon story about uncle earl and aunt myrna and my aunt elsie and uncle don campbell were in the audience the two whom earl and myrna were based on they got a big kick out of being earl and myrna
8675796 the story was about her winning a bake off at the fair baking a lemon cake on stage in front of the grandstand as acrobats performed and also an auto thrill show
8675797 they were my favorite aunt and uncle in my childhood and then i didnt see much of them for a long time for various reasons some of them not good so it was a moment of reconciliation to me the fair is a place of great amiability and that is its real power not the deep fried marshmallows

8675833 were not going to let our food costs rise faster than our food budgets so if we can buy in bulk we can save in a per eating effect
8675834 overall these trends last a long period of time because consumers adjust their buying habits and they change their routine
8675835 i wanted to be able to buy in bulk when things were on sale or at a pretty good price and have the room to save and freeze and store anything that we can get a good price
8675836 the other thing i would say about our brands is that they have faced world wars they have faced revolutions they have faced more economic cycles than we will see and they are today faster more profitable and appealing to more customers than ever before
8675837 inevitably the companys outlook for 2009 is rather less bullish and the ongoing rise in commodity costs could yet erode some of its operating margins

8675893 soften the impact of these attacks and themes or create a counternarrative for the media to cover
8675894 i am feeling really frustrated today i am sensing that something is wrong with this convention and that there will be no bounce i dont know exactly what we need to do to get a bounce but i do know that we havent done it yet although i might be dangerously treading into i know it when i see it territory i knew after al gore s convention 2000 speech that he would get a bump while i had a really bad feeling after the 2004 convention the polling backed me up in both cases the tracking polls today show obama ahead by 1 rasmussen remember that this is after more than three days where democrats from the vp pick to the convention have completely dominated news coverage we havent gained any ground from last week and have in fact lost some that is not a good sign call me a hand wringer or whatever but i am nervous
8675895 i find this convention much less i dont know purposeful than i expected
8675896 i havent been that crazy about the convention thus far everything seems very meta john mccain is more of the same weve heard that but we havent heard enough about what exactly makes him more of the same also weve heard a lot about change but too little that speaks to struggling middle class people interestingly enough i thought bill clintons speech was actually the best on this front dont get me wrong the speeches are good and there havent been any errors it just seems a little blah and boring and frankly id like to see a little more ridicule and spice because god knows its coming next week
8675897 say what you will about the 2004 convention it had a theme conversely the first night of the 2008 democratic convention had michelle obama bring the warm and fuzzies ted kennedy calling forth tears and hankies and jim leach speaking quietly and pedantically without any serious promotion from the obama campaign the second night of the 2004 convention saw barack obama tearing apart the arena in 2008 we had mark warner with a well crafted speech that fell flat because it was an attack structure that refused to name the politician it was attacking you had hillary cinton giving a powerful address but it was an address that was broadly aimed at problems in the democratic party not the problems with the republican party
8675898 the first two days of the convention were wasted or seemed so from my vantage point tonight joe biden will rip into mccain and tomorrow obama will do whatever he does then on friday at noon john mccain will announce his vice presidential nominee strangling any convention bounce in the crib then the republican convention will begin and you can be assured that they will remember barack obamas name they will remember how to make fun of him how to mock his celebrity and inexperience and the media will not cover ron paul s protesters with the vigor or attention they gave to hillary clintons diehards instead they will cover four days of straight attacks on barack obama culminating with a grave address about sacrifice and service from john mccain and unless obamas convention makes a sharp turn tonight and tomorrow they will have done nothing to soften the impact of these attacks and themes or create a counternarrative for the media to cover
8675899 what continues to be missing is a frame to explain why john mccain believes all these wrongheaded things he talks about but its very simple mccain used to stand against the ideologues and moneyed interests of the gop but he decided that if he wanted to win the gop nomination he had to make himself their ally i suspect democrats will regret this when republicans tear barack obamas character apart next week
8675900 its three nights into the democratic convention and a pattern is emerging a number of speakers have made reference to their personal friendship with john mccain carefully noting how much they admire him before going on to criticize him and thats effective to a point more in sorrow than in anger plays differently than straight on attacks but democrats might find it would be more effective if they explained why theyre so disappointed with their friend john mccain how did this great guy they admire so much became a candidate whose positions appall them it wasnt a fluke it wasnt like he had a personality transplant and the answer would seem to fit perfectly into a powerful democratic narrative john mccain changed because thats what he had to do to win the republican nomination thats what the reigning conservative ideology and interests demanded of him democrats may need to find a more direct way of describing mccains transformation flip flops if you will their current version leaves open the possibility that this good decent man could revert to his old self and thats not something democrats want undecided voters to believe
8675901 mccain has had to prostrate himself to the neocons the theocons and the moneycons because thats what it takes to win the republican nomination these days you have to be a good soldier and one way or another thats a story that the democrats need to tell a laundry list of flip flops doesnt make an impression unless you explain whats behind it obama needs to make people understand that all the stuff they dont like about the past eight years isnt just the fault of one guys idiosyncrasies its the fault of an entire worldview and if you elect mccain youre electing that worldview too
8675902 while the mccain republicans have launched brutal personal and callow attacks on obamas integrity sincerity and patriotism the obama democrats have treated mccain with respect and deference more respect and deference than his nasty petty little campaign deserves they are taking a risk
8675903 democrats sure are a bunch of nervous nellies arent they
8675904 i havent been able to discern any overarching theme and id have loved to see more republican bashing but overall i still think its been a good convention for the democrats and not because the so called rift has been healed its been a good convention because the civil war storyline actually ended up revealing that the democratic leadership for all their faults has far more firepower than the tired freakshow the republicans are going to throw out next week the young generation from obama to beau biden and the older generation from bill and hillary to joe are all politicians of stature compared to the d list of oddballs even by republican standards who will be on the stage in minneapolis rudy giuliani mitt romney mccain mike huckabee joe lieberman etc
8675905 i thought bidens speech was very well aimed bidens oratory didnt soar it lowered its shoulder and charged not a decisive piece of oratory but a solid grounded attack on mccain and a confident restatement of the campaigns principles and loyalties bidens speech tonight didnt bring anyone to tears but its the sort of message that carries you through an election the obama campaign isnt fighting the primary anymore they dont need to be beautiful so much as they need to be effective
8675906 joe biden lacked poetry but he really really hammered mccain given that is what i have hoped to hear from democrats for so long during this campaign it was great to hear he seems to be every bit of the attack dog that we had hoped for when the short list became clear
8675907 that was a great speech nicely delivered and went to the key points pumped up obama and made the case against john mccain exactly what was needed
8675908 the second half of bidens speech was a powerful indictment of mccain a heaping close to 9 minute serving of the red meat that has been sorely missing from the convention menu this week and effectively made the case that national security is actually john mccains weakness thats a point democrats need to relentlessly hammer home from now until election day even when its not national security night
8675909 may i just observe that while barack obama relies on having well written speeches to make his oratorical performances impressive bill clinton is just relying on pure skills of awesomeness to make texts that are pretty disjointed on the page seem incredibly compelling
8675910 god i love bill clinton i just cant not like him
8675911 very solid speech classic bill sort of reminds me of the weird anguish of last spring thinking wed never see this guy again he did what he needed to do and he got things moving in a direction the convention needs to go also good that he said one thing john mccains an extremist we need to hear that again and again because it has the virtue of being true
8675912 overall it was of course a great speech the guys a natural and that line about people the world over being more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power pure bill
8675913 i did think he was too soft on mccain overpraising his independence and failing to note the flip flops and reversals that have marked mccains campaign but these are minor quibbles will this speech help obama in the general election almost certainly and obama would be wise to draw on bill extensively in the coming campaign will it help heal the democratic party definitely
8675914 bill clinton did ok he beat the spread but this was no home run he did what hillary clinton didnt last night which was to explicitly address the experience question and say obama is ready to be president it was a good moment but not much more than a declarative statement without what bill typically does best in speeches make an argument is the sound bite enough sound familiar yeah bill it sounds like january through early june 2008
8675915 it was striking that bill clinton never uttered the words john mccain four years ago that steady insistence on retaining the robes of the presidency levitating an inch or two above the fray made sense it was clinton choosing a particular and honorable path that forever defined him as an ex president rather than an ex candidate but after heatedly involving himself in the democratic primary after often attacking barack obama by name it seemed peculiar that he would hold that portion of himself in reserve four years ago clinton wasnt a campaigner this year he was
8675916 clinton didnt even try to make the case about all the ways mccain would make us less safe giving him a virtual free pass on this vital question yes the former president forcefully made the point that the charge of youth and inexperience being leveled at obama was the same charge leveled at him in 1992 but he never made the case why obama would be better at keeping us safe beyond saying he would try diplomacy first so while it was good to have clinton unequivocally voice his support for obama and lend his considerable authority to the case that obama is ready to lead his speech felt like a squandered opportunity a squandered opportunity that reinforced the notion that democrats either dont know how to talk about or dont have the stomach for talking about national security it felt very pre 9 11
8675917 i think the speech i just saw john kerry give is the best one ive heard at this convention and i do not have any doubt that its the best ive ever heard from him
8675918 kerry has more passion in his voice talking about republican political tricks and questioning democrats patriotism than ive ever heard from him even his own acceptance speech is this the best speech of john kerrys life
8675919 kerry is offering up exactly what this convention has been missing strong linkages between mccain and
8675920 if democrats are looking for a template to apply in the fall campaign they could do no better than the one kerry offered them wednesday night indeed had kerry been as aggressive as this in 2004 this weeks convention might well be nominating him for a second term
8675921 all i have to say is where was this guy in 2004
8675922 will be delivered from an elaborate columned platform resembling a miniature greek temple
8675923 the jokes are starting already the toga instructions from the mccain campaign my big fat greek acceptance speech obamas oddessey the barackolis is it supposed to look like the lincoln memorial the brandenberg gate the parthenon the white house the isle of lesbos maybe just maybe it will look a lot better on television but its hard to believe based on what weve seen so far the leading theory is that the obama leadership is in a bubble were completely blindsided by the celebrity ad and they continue to see organizing a presidential campaign as akin to putting on the greatest super bowl halftime show in history
8675924 the only way bambi could better fit into the caricature that the mccain campaign has painted of him would be if he wore a cape and had members of code pink throwing rose petals in his path as he walked to the podium
8675925 republicans who are mocking obamas appearance havent mentioned it but george w bush accepted his own nomination in 2004 on a set with a similar neoclassical theme with columns rising on either side of him as the pictures sets currently look strikingly similar with the podium set well in front of the columns and connected by a path the attachment to kitsch particularly at political conventions is clearly bipartisan
8675926 attention republicans everywhere who are scandalized by the stage decorations at barack obamas planned speech on thursday your great and powerful leader did it first
8675927 what people fail to remember is that no matter what the obama camp did the wingnuts and their surrogates would have a field day no matter what you really dont have to read folks like tom maguire for too long and i have been reading him for years to realize that no matter what the backdrop was he and others would be mocking it if it were nothing but american flags tom and others would claim he is really over doing the patriotism because he knows he is weak on the issue if it were just a normal stage with a few flags tom and others would claim it seems like he is afraid of overdoing the flags because the left wing base hates america and would be turned off heads they win tails you lose so it is greek columns in the background and tom and others are mocking it i am shocked by this turn of events
8675928 we do all know that virtually every american civic building is based on greek revival architecture right and that the obama backdrop actually looks like whether intended or not i dont know the remember theyre both illinoisians perhaps because obamas speech is on the 45th anniversary of dr martin luther king s i have a dream speech
8675929 team obama has become so overwrought at the mere thought of criticism that they now overreact on a constant basis its a measure of the fear in the campaign that they have decided that they cannot abide any criticism at all and instead of simply responding to it they attempt to silence it instead
8675930 the obama campaign is giving us a frightening glimpse of how unfit they are to wield power
8675931 sources tell me that the two finalists for macs veep are tim pawlenty and kay bailey hutchison obviously with the hillary womens revolt on the floor of the dnc and outside mccain has a great opportunity if he nominates a woman my favorite was alaska governor sarah palin but she has been compromised by a bogus alaska legislative investigation so now all eyes are turning to senator hutchison who has a strong conservative record down through the years shes a steady performer who will not be cowed by joe biden in the debates i know her well and i have high respect for her this doesnt mean governor pawlenty is out it just means that ms hutchison has moved high up on the list
8675932 the mccain campaign has been hammering obama with hillary centric ads they obviously think a lot of hillarys supporters are in play george h w bush was surprised when ronald reagan asked him
8675933 note to the mccain camp romney is crashing in intrade and kay bailey hutchison is going up ill remind you all she is pro choice and ill tell you all i will puke on my keyboard if she is the pick and probably will cease being excited about your campaign shell be a good governor she is not an inspiring veep pick and i speak for a large large number of republicans that is all
8675934 what has she done in her terms in the senate she gets into pictures at bill signings she is smart enough for the u s senate like biden but one has never heard her say anything thought provoking could she really hold her own against the glib biden not clear in terms of her personality what used to be called q ratings she doesnt strike me as much of an improvement on romney who is current on the issues and has executive experience and a recently honed asperity that works i am certain that hutchison is wonderful and charming in person its just not clear what her ability to connect or make the sale with voters would be absent those qualities the scent of tokenism pervades the air not the worst thing but its more like geraldine ferraro than hillary clinton
8675935 from the calls ive made and the conversations ive had i would say the person to watch is pawlenty no romney no lieberman although the people i talk to still think worry that there is a chance mccain has a surprise up his sleeve
8675936 the democrats are holding their convention at a time when the gop nominee is reasonably popular his party is reasonably unpopular and the current president a republican is extremely unpopular its easy to say when you dont have to actually organize the damn thing but i think that they could be doing a far better job than they are so far of using denver as a four day clinic on how john mccain will be just as bad as bush if not much much worse theres still time to make hay on this front obviously but so far i think the convention has been a big fat missed opportunity

8675969 is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8675970 i think republicans probably secretly pray that they have one republican somewhere in america who can achieve the same results that barack has achieved in this campaign
8675971 unlike other people he has a big measure here hes going to be measured against a guy he knows real well barack obama
8675972 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas

8675974 i think there needs to be a form of accountability but the key of any measure is value adding or how a student progresses throughout their time at school rather than how many high achieving students you have
8675975 if a schools falling behind weve got to bring extra resources to bear to help lift that school up and make sure the students in it get a great education

8675980 the ministers in a difficult position but i think spiritually it compromises our argument
8675981 that the grant of a criminal justice visa may be contrary to your decision to cancel dr haneefs visa and as a consequence contrary to the national interest
8675982 exercise his discretion and not issue a criminal justice visa advice he ignored
8675983 this document raises the question that the minister was asking the department only to be told what he wanted to hear dr haneefs lawyer rod hodgson told news ltd
8675984 we wanted to bike through we are not bothering anybody we just wanted to bike through the city its our city we pay taxes we arent contributing to the air pollution we are even increasing our fitness
8675985 i gave up a 2007 dodge magnum that got 12 miles to the gallon for this bike to be a conscious citizen of this planet
8675986 its time for all of us to get the tenacity to do what is right that is why i am voting for obama
8675987 reward for the last eight years by giving them four more
8675988 i dont think theres any doubt or lingering fears that hes not committed to see barack obama elected
8675989 the time for grieving is over all of us now want to do the next step and make nov 4 the day where we make history again by electing the first african american nominee

8676067 after consulting with our storage vendor it was agreed the most sensible option would be to copy the entire volume to a new disk structure still maintaining its integrity and structure from where we could re mount it correctly
8676068 unfortunately due to its size we didnt have spare capacity on the platform to create a complete duplicate of it
8676069 this shouldnt have happened shouldnt have been allowed to happen but it happened well be putting things into place that will prevent this from happening in the future

8676124 weve done too much in richmond in my view from the pulpit
8676125 dr jewell sherman was a pretty good instructional person and they just beat her to death
8676126 there is a need for a singular individual who is recognized as the voice of the school system
8676127 sure they report to the board but that individual in my opinion should be bigger than the board
8676128 its only in richmond where when there is a fight at a school you see board members on tv if a bus driver is found to have a suspended license you see a board member on tv if work permits arent going in fast enough you see board members quoted in the paper you never see that anywhere else
8676129 needs to be just very in tune with the pulse of the community
8676130 not that dr jewell sherman was not out there dealing with that but i think that is just paramount because of where things have gone and how hyper political things have gotten of late
8676131 needs to have the unfettered support of the business community
8676132 i would say everyone over 50 thinks they understand poverty particularly african americans who think they understand poverty because they all say oh we were poor too
8676133 they dont understand what it is and they dont understand the challenges these children face and the walls they have to climb just to be there
8676134 people talk about truancy and graduation rates and those things
8676135 you know the two biggest factors affecting graduation rates in richmond public schools are incarceration and pregnancy
8676136 we need to move from a culture of blame to a culture of learning i dont know if the people in this city are quite ready for that it seems to me that the culture of blame works just fine for them thats unfortunate but i can definitely say i feel that the board and whoever the next superintendent is will have to embrace that culture of learning in order to make a better school system for us all

8676140 we want parents to have this information they want to know how their childs school is going
8676141 when they move communities they also want to know about the schools in their new community so they can make a decision about which school their child should go to
8676142 from the point of view of government we want to know where schools are falling behind so that through our new national partnership with states we can make extra resources available to help lift that school up

8676151 i understand the democrats are trying to use the politics of envy and i dont think that works
8676152 the politics of jealousy or envy or a sense that somehow were going to be less likely to vote for someone because theyve achieved economic success
8676153 i think growing up as a military brat traveling around as a soldier and even being homeless for five years in a prison the notion that he is somehow above the american people is going to fall flat voters recognize a man who is very much in touch with american values american citizens
8676154 heres the problem john mccain is out of touch with americans who are struggling to keep their homes and worried about paying their bills
8676155 john mccain is so out of touch he thinks the economy is strong

8676169 sadly jobs have been leaving jefferson and st lawrence counties for years because of the astronomically high taxes placed on everything
8676170 their indifference to our economic plight is not because the people in new york city are bad or dont like us were just not a priority to them its a form of geographic discrimination as assemblyman im going to make sure they hear all of our voices loud and clear and that we are not left behind

8676202 senator mccain has always been sensitive to national crises in the 2000 race he postponed his announcement because of the situation in the balkans and we are monitoring the situation very closely
8676203 these are all strong indications that t costata may be the earliest example of marine overexploitation
8676204 our discovery that t costata was already on a trajectory of decline prior to this period corroborates this hypothesis by providing the first circumstantial evidence that humans were not only using but also depleting reef resources making t costata the likely earliest victim of anthropogenic degradation of coral reefs
8676205 declining marine and terrestrial resources by human and climatic factors respectively may have acted in concert to thwart the precocious but short lived colonization of the near east by anatomically modern but technologically primitive humans at the end of the last interglacial
8676206 this illustrates how rapidly the flys brain can process sensory information into an appropriate motor response
8676207 we also found that when the fly makes planning movements prior to take off it takes into account its body position at the time it first sees the threat
8676208 when it first notices an approaching threat a flys body might be in any sort of posture depending on what it was doing at the time like grooming feeding walking or courting our experiments showed that the fly somehow knows whether it needs to make large or small postural changes to reach the correct preflight posture this means that the fly must integrate visual information from its eyes which tell it where the threat is approaching from with mechanosensory information from its legs which tells it how to move to reach the proper preflight pose
8676209 is transformed into an appropriate pattern of leg and body motion prior to take off
8676210 this is a rather sophisticated sensory to motor transformation and the search is on to find the place in the brain where this happens
8676211 it is best not to swat at the flys starting position but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
8676212 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8676213 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8676214 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8676215 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8676216 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
8676217 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8676218 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
8676219 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8676220 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways
8676221 the bail bond agency which holds the bond has the authority to take the defendant into their custody and return them to jail without doing any paperwork in advance the bail bond agent would bring the defendant to the jail

8676238 the clandestine removals carried out under the disguise of voluntary return policy to zimbabwe reflects a changing political climate in britain rather than any lessening in the merits of zimbabwean asylum claims
8676239 what has changed since 2002 is not zimbabwe but the british political climate in 2002 zimbabwe was much in the news because of the take over of white owned land
8676240 even the conservative party supported the suspension of removals now zimbabwe has dropped out of the news headlines few british politicians seem to care any longer about what happens to black zimbabweans
8676241 but those of us and our friends who do care wish to register a strong protest against such double standards and call for the government to act swiftly in order to save lives of many zimbabweans

8676297 im in the background if they say they need something my job is to get it for them
8676298 my opponent hit a lot of slices and wasnt the type to come forward i thought i would move up front instead even though my feet were feeling heavy i was fine
8676299 there are no easy games you just take it as it comes we are just delighted to be in it
8676300 i have to disagree with you right off the bat tribal bands chinese characters and sailor jerry are totally classics i mean they suck but come on they totally are and really dragon tattoos arent even that popular anymore but youre right skulls and mom will never go out of style everybody loves their mom
8676301 when i went on carson dalys show he showed me a tattoo on his ankle that used to say love for jennifer love hewitt
8676302 some of my favorite tattoos ever have been based in pop culture bob barker tony danza but only because im laughing at the people who have them in my book theres this guy i met who had four gwen stefani tattoos which is pretty ridiculous but at least its funny to everyone else right oh ill tell you the one that i hated the most fucking napoleon dynamite oh my god i hate that tattoo i hate the person who got it and i hate the movie that one pisses me off so much and the worst part is that they did it like a skull and crossbones where the bones were chapsticks like when i was in high school all the john hughes movies were out what if i had gotten fucking judd nelson on my arm you know what i mean
8676303 actually i think you should only get funny stuff but you have to be smart to get a funny tattoo heres an example of a horrible funny tattoo this guy i met got stupid tattooed on his forehead hes 19 and he thinks thats hilarious but for the rest of his life hes going to have stupid on his forehead and even worse on the back of his head he has fuck off i mean what are you doing thats the dumbest thing i also met this guy who has a tattoo of britney spears with her head shaved what if she kills herself its not going to be funny its going to be horribly horribly tragic a great tattoo is one that will never not be funny and thats hard to find the best tattoo ive ever seen in my life was a shark sitting on a la z boy smoking a bong with a tribal tattoo on its fin every element of that is retarded and thus its timeless
8676304 the wizard represents the magic of possibility and hes holding a camera because i take photos and the flames are because im really passionate about pursuing it as a career hence these chinese characters for hope
8676305 im definitely on the same page with this for example theres something to be said for people getting weird raver tattoos maybe you did a bunch of ecstasy in the 90s and you want a little e pill or something but when you get an alien sitting on a mushroom smoking a hookah then youre out of control ive also seen a lot of suns and moons which is fine but then they had to make it like a sun on top of a tribal band with butterflies and dolphins swimming around it and the tasmanian devil dancing underneath this happens a lot with astrological signs too people get those buddha eyes and then they cant just stop there they have to put it on top of a landscape with rivers and clouds and mountains and a whole bunch of crap jumbled together you have to know when to stop

8676337 this war is not about south ossetia abkhazia or georgia
8676338 it is about the matrix of the russian state and its survival the beast needs feeding
8676339 mikhail gorbachev made military and political concessions to the west he agreed to the unification of germany and the liquidation of the warsaw pact but a few years later the country where he was president fell apart
8676340 americas expansionist plans and desire to establish control over russias neighbours
8676341 nothing scares us including the prospect of a cold war we have lived in different situations and we will survive
8676342 when you cross the road you have to check for dangers
8676343 the west can apply psychological pressure but europe cannot afford to turn down our gas and america needs our help with afghanistan and iran
8676344 now the country should fight not only against its external enemies but also with the fifth column pro western liberals should be interned war is war the time of patriots is coming the time for revenge for all the humiliation from these people that we have been suffering for years
8676345 talking about the right for independence about genocide and the war crimes of mr saakashvili russias leaders are perhaps forgetting about the tens of thousands of civilians who were killed by russias bombardment of grozny and who were executed cleansed and tortured by the russian military in chechnya
8676346 the most economically sophisticated presidential candidate in years or maybe decades
8676347 now thats the story now telling it elegantly low taxes smaller government the way the republicans have i think is more of a challenge
8676348 i find it very disconcerting that there are high level military officials that are unaware of this growing problem this is a serious issue that deserves serious attention from the pentagon brass
8676349 all the gang bangers all the blacks mexicans and white supremacists i would say that 10 of army and marines they are not in the navy and air force so much are racist extremists of some variety
8676350 ive heard the military have relaxed the regulations from a couple of members that are in there
8676351 i think if a person wants to get into the military with just saying that they are in the national alliance now that they can in 2008 with the declining number of troops i dont think they are as picky as they used to be
8676352 we do encourage them to sign up for the military
8676353 we can use the training to secure the resistance to our government
8676354 our military doesnt agree with our political beliefs they are not supposed to be in the military but theyre there in ever greater numbers
8676355 a number of skinheads have gone into armed forces for education college tuition and the military training provided
8676356 they are using it to secure the future for white children anyone in the movement overseas knows they are getting training and financial help america began in bloody revolution and it might end that way
8676357 skinheads frequently use tattoos and symbols of lightning bolts skulls nazi swastikas eagles and nordic warriors
8676358 i get into fights maybe twice a month because some n s will get pissed off with it
8676359 i dont want to look at them i dont want them near me i dont want to smell them and people say oh people who are racialist youve never hung around black people bullshit ive showered with them ive lived with them i dont like them theyre fucking savages theyre tribal motherfuckers they are different to us how they think how they conduct themselves
8676360 we dont exclude people from the army based on their thoughts
8676361 we exclude based on behavior but a tattoo of an offensive nature racial sexual or extremist might be a reason for them not to be in the military
8676362 we try to educate recruiters on what extremist tattoos but its going to depend on the recruiters knowledge of tattoos
8676363 i dont know what they are youll have to come in they might be ok might not be ok
8676364 a racist tattoo in and of itself is not bar to enlistment its behavior that would prohibit someone serving or enlisting there are 1st amendment rights the concept seems to be if the tattoo is so patently offensive that it would cause disruption it could require action
8676365 a swastika would trigger questions but again if the gentlemen said
8676366 we have some members in the military theres a few in the 101 st airborne some at fort campbell and some marines in iraq
8676367 theres about 12 in there some of them have tattoos because anyone can walk in and get in the military now
8676368 i do believe you can join the service with tattoos
8676369 im sure you can join with a swastika theres a big gang problem in the armed forces right now if you went to a recruitment station with a swastika i dont think they would stop you it would be noted in your record
8676370 i know two people in the military one in marines and one in the army one has done two tours of iraq
8676371 they are so desperate at the moment they are going to let you in with a small swastika if you are an obvious racist and shoot niggers and queers you might find it difficult but generally you are fine
8676372 ive got reports from some of my sources in the military
8676373 they say they are getting a lot more skinhead types quasi racists more tattoos essentially they want guys that want to kill in iraq you dont know who your enemies are theres no frontline
8676374 guidelines for handling dissent and protest activities among members of the armed forces
8676375 participation in extremist organizations and activities by army personnel is inconsistent with the responsibilities of military service
8676376 they hauled me before some sort of committee and showed me the pictures and asked me what they were i just denied it and said my girlfriend was a spiteful bitch which is true
8676377 they knew what i was about but they let it go because im a great soldier and they knew that
8676378 colonel wood didnt know about his racism but they didnt want me to get out they were taking me to dinner taking me and my wife out
8676379 im a fighter i love combat i wanted to be in the action
8676380 w e didnt come over here to hang out at fort stewart
8676381 the most violent and best organized neo nazi skinhead group in the united states
8676382 some of my actions led to the deaths of arabs
8676383 it changes a human being i never had any kill counts some soldiers do
8676384 a slow painful death i strive why are you still alive
8676385 its our turn to watch you bleed its our turn to tear you limb from limb we will leave no survivors of this bloody war
8676386 in battle there are no laws its kill or be killed die with the rest relief came when i pulled the trigger and watched you die i cant stop laughing everytime i remember you start to cry watch you cry
8676387 to tell you the truth i hate arabs more than anybody
8676388 for the simple fact ive served over there and seen how they live theyre just a backward people them and the jews are just disgusting people as far as im concerned their customs everything to do with the middle east is just repugnant to me
8676389 you have to break these peoples will to fight the only reason they are fighting is that there is some sort of profit to it or its not that bad that the americans are not going to do what they did in world war two and kill everybody
8676390 fuck yeah if we had occupying force cracking down on spitting on sidewalk would you spit on sidewalk if they shot you in the head for it go in with iron fist this is how you will live if you dont well kill you quit pussy footing around listen to us or die
8676391 they only knew when i let them know they would always kid around and say
8676392 no i was hardcore i would volunteer for all the hardest missions and they were like let fogarty go you know what i mean they didnt want to get rid of me
8676393 what happens is you get to choose whether you want to go to europe or america and i put down germany the military didnt care my friends picked me up from frankfurt airport and i played two shows
8676394 the tattoo i suppose i cant hide everything people knew even the chain of command
8676395 the military is to some extent desperate to get people to go to fight soldiers who are not fit mentally and physically sick but they continue to send them
8676396 well thats 14 000 people they dont do training exercises that big 90 of the gangs in the u s are gangs but 9 are white supremacists thats 1 400 people are being trained by the armed forces who are extremist racists
8676397 various white supremacist groups have been documented on military installations both domestically and internationally
8676398 stretch across all branches of service they are linking up across the branches once theyre inside and they are hard core
8676399 you can go in any restaurant you can find graffiti maybe a swastika
8676400 or i hate hajjis what they call someone with middle eastern heritage
8676401 as it effects someones performance most guys are white in the infantry a lot of them tend to be of european descent it may have made someone else uncomfortable
8676402 once i saw some swastikas in our barracks stationed in japan i dont know who that was they never found out who it was but there wasnt much investigation into it as an extremist act rather than an act vandalism
8676403 all men with military experience retired or active reserve should join this group to see how many men have experience to build an army we want to win a war we need soldiers
8676404 love to shoot my m16a2 service rifle effectively at the hachies iraqis
8676405 overweight lazy illegals wiggers rape crimes soldiers that died in iraq the air force i called in an airstrike and they were apparently had
8676406 thanks brother kill a couple towel heads for me ok
8676407 i get out in 2009 i have the training i need and will pass it on to others when i get out
8676408 try get a few notches on ya rifflebutt from the filthy sand nigger cunts
8676409 good luck mate stay safe get a few kills and come home
8676410 g ood luck and i hope everything goes well stay safe keep your head down and try to bag a few sand niggers
8676411 they were begging me to reenlist they didnt want me to get out my whole military career they didnt want me to get out
8676412 you make a lot of money at blackwater 100 000 a year i was getting 30 000 when i was in the army
8676413 exactly i would think so they are hardcore theyre doing cool stuff the army is fighting with boxing gloves on blackwater is gloves off
8676414 it was slanderous they painted me as a dumbass id like to meet them in a parking lot
8676415 i would have been able to stay in without the spl
8676416 they the army wouldnt care unless i made an incident at work but now the spl comes out it looks bad
8676417 a combination of manpower shortages and poorly written inconsistently enforced regulations
8676418 has resulted in the recent reappearance of significant numbers of extremists in the armed forces
8676419 im concerned with the welfare and wellbeing of white americans
8676420 but the main thing with me is not so much that people look but theres a particular interest that there is on the media most of the people are jewish theyll admit it its not good when you have a population of 3 brainwashing the rest of the populace people should be made free to have information because the masses are stupid
8676421 i was kind of at a cross roads in my life doing a dead end job
8676422 i wanted to try to better myself and i thought about joining the military
8676423 but ive met quite a few of them actually last year i ran across a lot of people i was sitting in the barracks in the u s
8676424 there were some guys i overheard on their laptop and they were playing music from resistance records a neo nazi music label i never noticed people causing a raucous the unit i was with was what would be considered good ol boys from the country
8676425 i had worked for national vanguard books and they were like who owns it and i said its owned by a corporation so they said isnt it owned by the national alliance i said i dont know are you member no i dont hold membership but i work for them
8676426 im not going to do it ive had enough now
8676427 coordinations are made with local agencies at least once a month
8676428 an attempt to locate with minimal information provided met with negative results
8676429 participated in a white extremist meeting and also provided a military technical manual 31 210 improvised munitions handbook to the leader of a white extremist group in order to assist in the planning and execution of future attacks on various targets
8676430 this investigation is being terminated action commander or prosecutor indicated intent either to no action or action amounting to less than a court proceeding and no further investigative assistance of cid is required by the commander or prosecutor
8676431 since the soldier has been mobilized to camp shelby ms in preparation for deployment to iraq
8676432 the failure of the current policy is best illustrated by the case of robert lee west
8676433 regulations apply only to those who are active members of hate groups
8676434 we think it makes perfect sense for the military to end this problem once and for all
8676435 by issuing and enforcing regulations that make it clear that anyone who espouses extremist ideology or who publicly identifies himself as a neo nazi or white supremacist is not fit to serve in this nations armed forces
8676436 civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them
8676437 facing years in jail for a conviction of a single particular charge
8676438 in fact all the charges were municipal court violations that do not carry such penalties
8676439 blow up 2 makes even clearer enlargements now but the biggest improvements are in ease of use
8676440 we looked for tedious or confusing aspects of every stage of photo cropping and resizing and built intelligence into blow up 2 to take those hassles out of the photographer
8676441 one can only hope that the dems have a similar plan for next week
8676442 sou a barbie girl reached 1 in brazilian charts and the album went gold
8676443 yeah it sucks because i see all these super cute shoes in the stores guccis ysls manolos and when they bring them out in my size they look like clown shoes
8676444 im not having the other one removed unless today is a really good day
8676445 this is contrary to our stance that registration should be separate from such considerations
8676446 a further concern is that the appeals process itself could be abused and used to delay entry of products to market for example by competitors
8676447 its heading over some of the warmest waters and will have time to build it could be a devastating hurricane

8676451 bantuan dari pt freeport harus jelas melalui badan indonesia tidak boleh langsung diberikan pada yang bersangkutan
8676452 improving crystal quality and purity leads to explosive materials that are safer less likely to react violently when subjected to mechanical impact or heat
8676453 the design of custom solvents through first principles modeling opens up new possibilities for the dissolution of materials that are hard to dissolve
8676454 ah een tweeling die heb ik niet op mijn lijst staan
8676455 todays generation doesnt seen to have quite the same work ethic the same dedication as some of the older guys have
8676456 youd train six or eight guys and they would stay together for years but now theres more of a turnover
8676457 most peoples response is to run out of a burning building and were asking these guys to run into a burning building in this case a burning coal mine it takes a certain kind of person to do that
8676458 i expect to rely on my law clerks the internet for listening to open court proceedings conference calls for court conferences and communication to other members of the court by written memoranda and via my staff
8676459 the heavy rains and severe flooding in early june continue to take a toll on our state
8676460 i know that the democrats in west virginia are diehard blue and no matter if they came here on clintons side theyre leaving on obamas side and theyre going to fight hard
8676461 he has this energy to him that basically resonates inside of me it makes me want to be as involved not only with politics but with my community
8676462 to actually live and be able to tell your children about that
8676463 i think if youre in line with hillary clinton and her views youre definitely not in line with republican presidential candidate john mccain the two are directly in conflict with each other if you voted for hillary clinton you need to vote for barack obama this time around
8676464 van dit soort cijfers kun je gewoon niet negatief worden
8676465 gisteren kwam er ook al een positief cijfer overwaaien over de order voor duurzame goederen toch is het moeilijk in te schatten of het om een nmalige opleving gaat of dat de ergste pijn in de amerikaanse economie echt voorbij is ik verwacht dat er nog wel wat ellende aan zit te komen bijvoorbeeld vanuit de huizensector
8676466 de cijfers waren gewoon niet goed genoeg in nederland gaat het buitengewoon aardig maar in de vs krijgt het bedrijf het lek bij de slecht draaiende supermarkten maar niet boven

8676471 sitting down with morrissey was both daunting and exciting he is such an interesting person with strong opinions and immense musical talent he does not mince words when he dislikes something but when he talks about music he respects he is an outspoken fan
8676472 traveling is difficult but the actual moment when you are on stage with your songs is perfect
8676473 at the time when music happens to you and grabs you and jumps on top of you you dont realize that it will stay with you forever you think youll outgrow everything but with music with artists you actually fall in love you fall in love with that moment hearing them and you fall in love with them

8676492 siit on yli 30 vuotta joten voin kertoa siit nyt pelasin nancyn paidassa nantesia vastaan vuonna 1975 olin tyytyv inen kalasteluuni ottelun j lkeenkin filmasin my hemmin viel toisessakin ottelussa mutta en en muista mik se oli siin kaikki en koskaan tehnyt niin uudelleen
8676493 the probability that we may fail in the struggle ought not to deter us from the support of a cause we believe to be just
8676494 thomson thomson we are taking heavy fire in sector fifty six
8676495 this is thomson these guys are just asking to lose this battle
8676496 it would appear that everyone did what they were supposed to do except laron
8676497 they were brazen enough to think nobody would notice them coming and going
8676498 we are aware of this bug and plan to deliver a fix in the next software update she said
8676499 for now users can avoid the problem by changing their setting so that double clicking the home button goes to home or ipod
8676500 weve had a couple of incidents and then the chp has responded to a couple of crashes involving minors and alcohol
8676501 thats a lot to keep track of when our officers are handling over 60 000 calls for service per year on average
8676502 this grant will allow us to have the manpower on an overtime basis to focus our efforts and resources effectively in order to attack the problem
8676503 were kind of like gypsies we go around to surrounding communities and schools some of the guys coach on school teams and if they can get field space for us then we play there
8676504 in the short term were trying to make it so people dont get displaced
8676505 in the long term the big policy issue is how do the taxpayers of palo alto want to allocate the money we spend on fields
8676506 the way ive understood it from council is that the first priority is city residents
8676507 i just think theres room for everybody and we are part of the whole soccer fabric of the community
8676508 many people thought the sky was falling this spring but the economy actually expanded quite solidly
8676509 because of this funding our leading researchers and student scholars can have a real impact on many of societys pressing issues
8676510 our researchers will be able to make a difference by undertaking practical projects while enhancing classroom learning
8676511 we can have all the robust technologies in the world but we need the social sciences and humanities to know how to harness them and interpret them from a human perspective so that they translate into benefits for society
8676512 whether its protecting gorillas in the republic of congo or monkeys and gibbons in cambodia conservation can and does work when you have government commitment and scientific knowledge on the ground
8676513 now we must put into place the management to truly protect these populations and apply the approach to other regions where primates are in trouble
8676514 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
8676515 wcs is therefore committed to continuing to work with the cambodian government to ensure that these globally important primate populations will continue to remain secure
8676516 keep up to date on storm information knowing things like where the storm is predicted to hit where the storm surge is expected how far reaching the storm is all of these things will help you determine whether you are in danger or not
8676517 for example the storm probably will not hit your city or if it does it will likely not be as bad as you think
8676518 take the appropriate steps that you always hear about like securing loose items outside boarding windows having enough food and water on hand ensuring your pets safety and other important storm precautions
8676519 children feed off of their parents anxiety so it is important that you get it under control remind your children that you are the parent and as such you are taking every precaution necessary to ensure their safety
8676520 by exuding confidence you can help calm your childrens fears
8676521 it is important that we keep updated by watching or listening to the news but keep in mind that the media is far reaching and may be basing reports and warnings on specific viewing areas for example the circumstances for someone living in galveston may be much different for those in houston or beaumont
8676522 if there is a mandatory evacuation for the area youre in then by all means evacuate however if the choice is optional take the time to list the advantages and disadvantages and see if one list outweighs the other
8676523 make sure your reasons are based on facts rather than emotions after the evacuation disaster of hurricane rita i heard many people say they would never evacuate again however if your area of town is expected to get hit with a category five hurricane that thought may not be logical

8676525 even though the use of statin therapy in elderly patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis has increased substantially during the past decade our study showed many patients remain untreated
8676526 this was especially evident in patients with cvd and pad with data from january to march in 2004 that indicated that less than 50 percent of these patients were on statins
8676527 our findings highlight the treatment care gaps in patients with atherosclerosis and may be useful for guiding medical interventions focusing continuing medical education programs encouraging active discussions on risk reduction therapies at scientific meetings and other educational outreach programs that aim to bring physicians practice into agreement with current guidelines for cardiovascular risk reduction

8676544 the people behind me are crucial to the future of this country
8676545 why do we need 60 democrats why is reid the first senate majority leader to say we need 60 votes rather than a majority to get things done
8676546 in 2005 when republicans had a majority they stopped democratic filibusters why cant you do the same now
8676547 they have a story line but i want us to all shout loud and clear so the press can hear it we are united behind obama

8676587 were honored that these great artists are lending their voices to this celebration of two american icons john steinbeck and woody guthrie were the voices of a generation and the issues that resonated with them over 50 years ago still remain issues that we face today
8676588 gosto mais de estar aqui h muita gente uma maior comunidade

8676593 1 this will probably never happen to you anyway so stop being paranoid gays mostly stick to their own and besides you re probably not attractive enough to get past our raptor like imperfection detectors the reason we re looking at you like that is because we re judging you not lusting
8676594 because russias claim to be helping serbia will no longer seem like a matter of principle but rather like a political game russia has now lost credibility
8676595 if banks are unable or unwilling to lend monetary policy doesnt work so well
8676596 the credit crunch is morphing from an american centred financial crisis into a global economic crisis
8676597 if you have a chance of working for a healthy company or a sick one
8676598 choose the sick one the sickest ones need the best doctors and its a lot easier to stand out in a company that needs help
8676599 you had to get in and roll your sleeves up and grow businesses
8676600 its hard for the same people who put you in the ditch to pull you out of it
8676601 hes taught me the importance of seizing the airwaves and making clear what the business agenda is
8676602 if someone gets on a voicemail and promises something to thousands of people they will do it
8676603 its a huge issue its at least as big an issue as the dns issue if not bigger
8676604 i went around screaming my head about this about ten or twelve years ago we described this to intelligence agencies and to the national security council in detail
8676605 theres no vulnerabilities no protocol errors there are no software problems the problem arises from the level of interconnectivity thats needed to maintain this mess to keep it all working
8676606 everyone has assumed until now that you have to break something for a hijack to be useful
8676607 but what we showed here is that you dont have to break anything and if nothing breaks who notices
8676608 the rate of bgp path updates goes up by a factor of 200 to 400
8676609 they simply dont because it takes work and to do sufficient filtering to prevent these kinds of attacks on a global scale is cost prohibitive
8676610 that means that nobody could put themselves into the chain into the path unless they had been authorized to do so by the preceding as router in the path
8676611 we havent seen the attacks and so a lot of times people dont start working on things and trying to fix them until they get attacked
8676612 but the youtube case is the perfect example of an attack where somebody could have done much worse than what they did
8676613 the only thing that can force them to fix bgp is if their customers start to demand security solutions
8676614 what the americans call humanitarian cargoes of course they are bringing in weapons
8676615 nato is not an adversary but a partner of russia
8676616 as for the european union it seeks to build with this country a close and positive relation it is for russia today to make a fundamental choice
8676617 that is the same state cannot deploy a certain group without any limit
8676618 obviously there are other nato affiliated nations out doing things
8676619 i believe that it is the right decision to focus all our attention and resources on ensuring the planning and construction of a world scale 80 000 barrel per day fully integrated ctl plant in the ningxia hui autonomous region sasol is delighted to be a full partner in the integrated ctl project to bring its world leading proprietary technology and proven commercial ctl experience to china to produce high quality environmentally friendly fuels and to add significant value to both the chinese economy and sasol
8676620 in this particular ad we wanted our spokesperson and the other guy to come together to encourage customers to borrow smart
8676621 we always stress to our customers that a cash advance is a short term solution
8676622 and we know that the large majority of our competitors and certainly all borrow smart members have the same approach
8676623 the commercial fits perfectly with borrow smarts mission to unite short term lenders in order to better educate consumers and the public about the services we provide and to encourage the responsible use of those services

8676629 its a joint effort with the hamilton county republican party the norwood republican party and the various area candidates
8676630 the hope is that after watching this speech people will know a little bit more about who barack obama is where he comes from and where he wants to take this country
8676631 has anybody heard the word guant namo mentioned this entire convention
8676632 president barack obama and vice president joe biden will shut down guant namo
8676633 he former president bill clinton just touched on katrina torture cronyism and the crowd started rising and yet theyve never given them anything the red meat they want has anybody heard the word guant namo mentioned this entire convention theyre not doing the job that they ought to be doing for their party
8676634 president barack obama and vice president joe biden will shut down guant namo respect the constitution and make clear once and for all the united states of america does not torture not now not ever
8676635 coming up the reaction from our own rachael maddow plus david gregory and andrea mitchell on the convention floor we now await joe bidens speech about an hour from now bill clintons is in the books barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states youre watching msnbcs live coverage of the democratic national convention
8676636 and we must use all the weapons in our arsenal above all our values president obama and vice president biden will shut down
8676637 when john mccain stood on the deck of an aircraft carrier three months after 9 11 and proclaimed next up baghdad barack obama saw even then an occupation of undetermined length undetermined cost undetermined consequences that would only fan the flames of the middle east well guess what
8676638 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8676639 the claim she made during the primaries was obama wasnt prepared to be president of the united states
8676640 there is a caveat in that we were asking if they were willing to pay and werent asking for money
8676641 but the results show there is a willingness to contribute to carbon reduction projects and a large conducive target market for offsetters
8676642 for those who wish to offset their emissions fully you need a more standardised approach
8676643 but for those who just want to contribute something there is a need for a much simpler system where customers can pay a flat rate as some sort of climate compensation that will go to fund credible emission reduction projects
8676644 offsetting is complex and we do live in a soundbite world but if you acquiesce to that and let go of some of the accuracy that governs offsetting projects you are opening yourself up to criticism
8676645 el riesgo es suficientemente alto para que el proyecto sea detenido

8676712 we need something radical like putting elective cancer surgery on hold
8676713 it has reached absolute crisis point to the extent that the emergency medicine specialists are asking to use surgical beds too to make sure that patients actually receive the care they need

8676774 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

8676778 eat sehri because in it lie great blessings and again
8676779 i once visited rasulullah sallallaho alaihi wasallam at a time when he was busy in partaking of sehri
8676780 this is a thing full of blessings which allah has granted you do not give it up
8676781 even though there be no food then one date should be eaten or a drink of water taken
8676782 hear o israel the lord our god is one lord
8676783 the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord
8676784 and your god is one god there is no god but he
8676785 we worship one god in trinity and trinity in unity for there is one person of the father another of the son another of the holy ghost is all one they are not three gods but one god the whole three persons are co eternal and co equal he therefore that will be save must thus think of the trinity
8676786 baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost
8676787 there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one
8676788 i believe it because i was told to do so
8676789 thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve
8676790 they do blaspheme who say allah is one of three in a trinity for there is no god except one god
8676791 but god is not like a pie or an apple which can be divided into three thirds which form one whole if god is three persons or possesses three parts he is assuredly not the single unique indivisible being which god is and which christianity professes to believe in
8676792 your god is one god whoever expects to meet his lord let him work righteousness and in the worship of his lord admit no one as partner
8676793 take not with god another object of worship lest you should be thrown into hell blameworthy and rejected
8676794 this day have i perfected your religion for you completed my favour upon you and have chosen for you islam as your religion
8676795 have you ever wondered how you get triangles from a cow you need butter milk and cheese and an equilateral chainsaw

8676797 first of all let me just say that this money exchange is terrible for the people of california but it is good for proposition 11 because it proves once again how important it is to change the system and how important it is to take government back and make the people have ownership of government rather than the politicians in sacramento
8676798 we need to continue to add wind to diversify our generating options
8676799 it is a natural hedge against increasing natural gas costs which we have seen a dramatic run up in during the past year or so
8676800 so for our customers it makes sense for us to begin to add this resource
8676801 the wind deals we did early on were economic in the beginning
8676802 and when you look at what it costs to generate a megawatt of power with natural gas today what we are paying for that wind power really is economic now
8676803 inflation is certainly a real thing right now and it is impacting everyone
8676804 we are seeing wages rise significantly compared to last year
8676805 oklahoma is still strong relative to the rest of the country
8676806 people are still hiring the market is still very strong
8676807 if it works thats terrific but before we take a firm position on this thing were going to have to take a look at the arguments theyre going to advance
8676808 oklahoma is no 1 whew am i glad football season is back but wait that is our housing market
8676809 to me it affirms what we have been saying all along we did not have the overheated market and did not have the investor speculative market slow and steady was our pace and still is bottom line our prices are still increasing so if you dont buy now the price is going up good news for oklahoma i say
8676810 oklahoma is very fortunate this is the eighth straight year we are seeing steady increases in home appreciation
8676811 here in tulsa and throughout the state we have not experienced the sharp increases or decreases in home values that have occurred elsewhere on the contrary we have continued to see slight but steady growth during these uncertain times for other markets
8676812 this dynamic is fueled by the fact that our market is made up of solid demand from of home owners rather than from real estate speculators
8676813 it is simple i am on a bank advisory board and see across the board what the different business sectors are doing
8676814 ag business is stable to very good with the crop prices even with the fuel costs
8676815 many states are going backwards but oklahoma has these three sectors pushing our economy where most do not
8676816 we didnt have the unfounded appreciation that some of the areas hardest hit had we also didnt have a mortgage market that was completely dependant upon nonconforming loans the largest percentage of our properties can be purchased using conforming conventional and federal housing administration backed loans
8676817 being negative is a recursive function that will get invoked by someone else
8676818 it only takes one bad apple to spoil the rest
8676819 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort
8676820 change in america doesnt start from the top the top down it starts from the bottom up
8676821 we feel its one of the strengths of this campaign
8676822 is there any way that obama could be more perfect
8676823 after obama leads despite greater errors like his seal berlin speech etc
8676824 ha ha ha and if you believe that data i also have a bridge for sale in brooklyn

8676829 i cut off the fabric and used it to make a pattern i reused the zipper for the cushion and then trashed the rest of the blue canvas as it was neither nice nor clean i used a combination of new fabric thrifted fabrics corduroy cotton upholstery an old pair of pants and a mens shirt etc and block printed fabrics i used lino block prints of the oudjat eyes radiolarians jellyfish frog and lily pad koi seahorse walrus dragon and blue whales i also used one old screen print of the sun

8676835 it will probably take a few months of post production before we see any solid results from the taping
8676836 hey everyone i m posting this on behalf of my cousin velour
8676837 the prime minister has lost the mandate of the country and the nation
8676838 the government is like the titanic which is going to sink
8676839 i am glad to be back after a decade i really feel vindicated i feel great
8676840 clearly the prime minister has lost the mandate of the country and the nation
8676841 there is no threat from anwar he has won in a by election and he becomes just another mp
8676842 since the march 8 elections till now we have seen nothing but politicking but the defections havent happened they are waiting for it to happen but it hasnt happened good luck to them
8676843 sebagai ketua pembangkang di parlimen kita harap beliau akan menyumbang dengan baik kepada perjalanan amalan demokrasi dan membantu kita dalam usaha kita memajukan lagi negara kita
8676844 selepas segala yang saya harungi sepanjang tempoh itu sekarang saya berasa terharu dapat kembali ke dewan rakyat ia adalah hak saya
8676845 i am glad to be back after a decade i really feel vindicated i feel great
8676846 anwar whatever we think of him and many of us are deeply skeptical is looking more and more like our future prime minister
8676847 there is a mounting sense of inevitability to his impending succession
8676848 we have walked out because they have refused to respond
8676849 so theres no point in staying and participating in this debate
8676850 senator obamas speech tonight will be as he himself has characterized it more workmanlike a very direct conversation with the american people about the choice we face in this election about the risk of staying on the same path were on the risk of just more of the same versus the change we need
8676851 i am scheduled to be in minnesota tomorrow to be at the state fair
8676852 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years
8676853 doing the speech at mile high is an important point for our campaign its symbolic of how sen obama won the nomination it will show how obama wants to involve people who are not usually involved in the political process
8676854 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8676855 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8676856 there are still hurdles to be cleared but at this point iowas republican caucuses will be first in the nation for the 2012 presidential election
8676857 its an endorsement i think of the value of retail grassroots face to face campaigning for which new hampshire is so well known
8676858 some lenders want 40 percent down and weve written off a lot of the market that existed a year ago
8676859 people wont have to imagine what it looks like anymore
8676860 it will have great onsite amenities and like other condos downtown it will be close to restaurants and shopping
8676861 evenly paced slower than it was and slower than it should be
8676862 this is the newest and best product and its going to knock the socks off everyone
8676863 yeah obama savior will magically wave his economics wand and fix everything
8676864 but raising taxes and expanding government is certainly not the answer either
8676865 my guess is that as we have seen in the past lowering taxes and balancing the budget will be good for the economy
8676866 why not do the same with medicaid environmental programs and transportation projects
8676867 i just do not believe that we have to tax our way out of this i believe we can save our way out of this
8676868 if we can spend much less then we dont have to raise taxes
8676869 please god save this country from those determined to spend it into oblivion
8676870 as far as the depresion there are studies that make the case that roosevelt expanded and lengthened the depresion with his policies
8676871 you can either call me a hero or a villain but i took the time to recreate this it can be found in sizes adult small through adult xxl at my etsy store

8676873 this is the second time is five years sacs cited clayton s school board for micromanaging abuse of power conflict of interest and other unethical violations
8676874 kerry got it right candidate mccain has to finish his debate with senator mccain before he can debate obama
8676875 i agree that reagan took the high road in both 1980 and 1984
8676876 low road to point out someones policies is not slander
8676877 there are so many things wrong with obama that there is not enough time between now and the election to bring them all up
8676878 after all it wasnt us in power from 1948 through to 1994
8676879 ronald reagan never staged an ugly august he attacked his opponents but on the high ground of policy
8676880 osama is scary and a dipshit neophyte but the other guy sucks more in fact he sucks as bad as bush
8676881 maybe well be getting some in next week so check back then

8676906 ich freue mich auf alle diese spiele und bin zuversichtlich dass wir unser ziel weiterzukommen schaffen werden
8676907 das ist eine gruppe die es in sich hat aber wir sind der fc bayern wir werden weiterkommen
8676908 ich hoffe sehr dass das letzte spiel gegen mailand kein endspiel f r uns wird aber namen spielen keine rolle wir wollen es aus eigener kraft schaffen

8676920 i magine the litigation frenzy that will be produced if defense counsel must also take the plaintiffs deposition and obtain medical specials during this 30 day period not to mention the retention of experts and obtaining opinions from them why on earth do we want to do this
8676921 even assuming a situation unlike the one presented here where a defendant has no information about the plaintiffs damages when served with an early section 998 offer defense counsel may request that plaintiff provide informal discovery on the damage issue and or allow an extension of time to respond to the demand if plaintiffs counsel refused to accord the defendant these courtesies and unyieldingly insisted that defendant respond without information such conduct could then be presented to the trial court when it considered whether to award special fees and costs undoubtedly such obstinacy would be viewed as potent evidence that plaintiffs offer was neither reasonable nor made in good faith
8676922 with respect i do not think a defendant should be obligated to evaluate a 99 000 offer based on damages information supplied informally not under oath by a plaintiff or his attorney although plaintiffs attorneys are officers of the court on rare occasions such attorneys have been known to inflate their clients damages in demand letters written prior to discovery in my view a 998 offer approaching 100 000 can be reasonably evaluated only after basic discovery procedures requiring responses under oath have been used
8676923 i looked the man in the eye i found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul
8676924 no the risk varies if i build an empty concrete building there is a threat of damage from fire but it is negligible a low risk concrete can still burn given enough heat but it is unlikely to occur in normal circumstances if i now fill the building with flammable materials this has added a tangible vulnerability both the impact and the probability of the threat occurring have been increased by the vulnerability and likewise the risk product has also increased proportionally

8676947 on a positive note 66 percent of all vulnerabilities identified have been remediated underscoring the value of a consistent web site vulnerability management program
8676948 it should be noted however that the frequency with which security issues are reported does not reflect the frequency of their distribution in the wild

8676987 that if a mans faith is sincere it is the most important thing about him and that it is impossible to understand who he is and how he will lead without first understanding the religious vision that informs his life
8676988 it came about as a choice and not an epiphany the questions i had did not magically disappear but kneeling beneath that cross on the south side of chicago i felt gods spirit beckoning me i submitted myself to his will and dedicated myself to discovering his truth
8676989 christianity is but one religious tree rooted in the common ethical soil of all human experience
8676990 with the speechs tone of moderation its welcome of faith into the public square and yet its insistence that people of faith conduct themselves in public debate according to democratic values it became what obama had intended a call to reform a redefinition of religions role in american political life soon his words were debated on cable news programs heard by tens of thousands on youtube and argued fiercely on web sites from every political perspective
8676991 one of the biggest tests heading into the convention was if the democratic party could unify itself and at least in that sense it seems to have been very successful
8676992 bill and hillary clinton were crucial to this and they seemed to have not only reconciled themselves to barack obamas candidacy but they appeared to have some genuine enthusiasm about it
8676993 i was really disappointed in both of the clintons from february until hillarys speech at the convention this week
8676994 i really feel she was being sincere and even though bill looked disappointed during her speech he redeemed himself with his own speech both of them were very clear in telling people that they must vote democrat in this election regardless of the candidate and i was so glad they said that
8676995 i was disheartened to see men standing in the top two spots at the convention yet again
8676996 it seems to me that the democratic party has some serious work to do in terms of selecting the most viable candidate and taking on that other ism sexism that being said i will vote for obama because i feel i have to as a democrat hillarys speech reaffirmed my decision to do so
8676997 ratings have increasingly declined for conventions as they became less important over the years and no real news emerged from them
8676998 you get people tuning in but those are mostly the people who are decided voters you have to wonder if the people who have the most concerns about barack obama even bothered to watch the democrats need to win the independents and the undecided voters to take the white house and those people likely werent even watching this convention
8676999 reagan had to work hard to make voters feel more comfortable with him it wasnt one moment one electrifying speech at the convention it really was a long drawn out process

8677007 they play really well and were really proud of them
8677008 its title sponsor driven as opposed to tv driven like the nba
8677009 its kind of hard to believe that they would go to that extreme way of limiting some of the international players to come and compete
8677010 the reaction ive heard at least from the player side of it is that the players are all ok with it both the non english speaking ones and the english speaking ones

8677018 this one size fits all approach is unfair to smaller communities who by nature cannot generate the money needed to recover from the storm without passing significantly more costs onto the homeowners and business owners already suffering from the loss of personal property and damage to their homes and businesses
8677019 while 3 5 million of damage may not be a lot of money to new york city and other larger cites or municipalities it seems to be an insurmountable amount for the city of rensselaer and its taxpayers
8677020 their denial of aid is completely unfair to the residents of the city of rensselaer time and time again we see communities hurt by disaster being rebuilt with help from the federal government but just two weeks after a heavy flood that affected a big part of our city the federal government is shutting the door in rensselaers face

8677026 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8677027 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8677028 nothing about the projects execution inspires the feeling that this was ever intended as anything more than a lark which would be fine if it were a good one
8677029 as it is audience teeth grinding sets in early and never lets up
8677030 pitt slices the ham very thick indeed but uniquely emerges as endearing in doing so
8677031 im not going to get into who i call or dont call
8677032 but this report that i called senator lieberman and told him you call senator mccain and withdraw from the vice presidential race is incorrect
8677033 i receive phone calls from people who are friends over there which ive said a million times
8677034 as of now we can say with confidence that in both regions abkhazia and ossetia ethnic cleansing is fully completed
8677035 theyve expelled from all villages remnants of the georgian population theyve destroyed their houses theyve looted their property theyve burned down their fields forests
8677036 it was a concerted action of russian official military forces together with paramilitaries
8677037 the pattern is that they create a buffer zone basically its an empty territory now because people are expelled houses are destroyed all fields are burned so that it will be very difficult for people to return home
8677038 most of the georgians they left south ossetia before this aggression
8677039 we hope that there will be ethnic unity in this region
8677040 if there are certain acts of unjust attitude toward georgians living in south ossetia im sure that the new authorities will undertake proper and effective measures to remove these difficulties
8677041 i think it will not be a long period for us its clear that sooner or later we will leave the territory
8677042 we fled from our homes only those of us who could hide yesterday are safe now others were beaten up
8677043 many people thought the sky was falling this spring but the economy actually expanded quite solidly
8677044 exaggerated reactions tend to happen when you have thin trading
8677045 my dad who fell on hard economic times always told me champ when you get knocked down get up
8677046 failure at some point in your life is inevitable but giving up is unforgivable
8677047 i am here for everyone i grew up with in scranton and wilmington
8677048 i am here for the cops and firefighters the teachers and assembly line workers the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures our greatest presidents from abraham lincoln to franklin roosevelt to john kennedy they all challenged us to embrace change now its our responsibility to meet that challenge millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up back up together our debt to our parents and grandparents is too great our obligation to our children is too sacred
8677049 we have told our union members to call a leave of absence to join the rally in bangkok to oust this government which has been damaging the country over the past seven months
8677050 ive told the police not to break up the crowd but to encourage people to leave
8677051 after thorough consideration it would be too dangerous to do so
8677052 we wont leave government house as ordered by the civil court
8677053 our demands remain the same to have the government resign and to prevent an amendment of the 2007 constitution
8677054 as the police have so far shown restraint and resisted efforts to disperse the crowd by force and shoulder the consequences the pad is pinning its hopes on some men in green sharing its goal of toppling the government
8677055 no entry as ordered by the court violators to be prosecuted
8677056 reviving images of bill and al and hillary and tippers excellent adventure in 1992
8677057 hopefully what were talking about is something that will not happen
8677058 if it does we wouldnt just say come back next year what we would do is work with them on where they fell short provide them the resources they need the tutoring and when we feel like they need to be evaluated again we would evaluate
8677059 the bottom line is we dont have a job if we dont entertain
8677060 in my mind thats as big a part of the job as shooting under par
8677061 we play so good overall when you win you should give your speech in english mostly what comes out is nerves totally different language in front of camera youre excited and not thinking in english
8677062 the lpga could come out and say they only want 10 koreans but theyre not
8677063 a lot of korean players think they are being targeted but its just because there are so many of them
8677064 the economy is bad and we are losing sponsors everybody understands
8677065 this is an american tour it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8677066 this should be a priority in their professional development just the way working on their short game is a priority

8677084 how the image would be perceived by a motorist passing it in transit
8677085 the reason we have advised you that we cannot post these as billboards is that out of context neither in a museum setting or website the images as stand alone highway or city billboards appear to be deceased soldiers the presentation in this manner could be perceived as being disrespectful to the men and women in our armed forces
8677086 my son and his friends would have been of draft age had there been a draft though none of them volunteered for military service since the war began i wondered about the young men and women who opted to serve and put their lives on the line i wondered about what they would experience at war and how they would manage their transition to civilian life in making these portraits i wanted to look into the face of a young person who had seen something unforgettable and i wanted to make that a serious and intimate view the way i would look at my own son
8677087 viewing these portraits of soldiers causes one to pause and think of the many sacrifices and efforts these men and women have experienced to protect us and defend this great country the portraits are a stark reminder of the reality of it all
8677088 for me looking at their faces serves also as a reminder to remember our service men and women and to thank them for all they do and have done i am disappointed that the billboards have been canceled and strongly hope the company will reconsider
8677089 we have every intention of moving forward with our plans
8677090 barring these images from billboards in the twin cities or any city for that matter not only deprives the public of seeing these beautiful portraits but it is an insult to the young soldiers who posed for these pictures
8677091 when we pushed to gain back time on block he just pushed back we werent able to catch him
8677092 i had to win ojibwe to stay in the hunt for the championship and i drove my best rally of the year only to have it go extremely bad on the last stage with only a few miles to go
8677093 i did exactly what i needed to do to win here and set up a big title fight for the rest of the year but one mistake is all it took to end it all
8677094 the red thread the inspiration and passion of valentino garavani
8677095 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
8677096 we are close to a serious conflict u s and nato preparations on a strategic scale are ongoing in the operation the west conducted on georgian soil against russia south ossetians were the victims or hostages of it we can see a rehearsal for an attack on iran
8677097 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8677098 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8677099 in light of the build up of nato naval forces in the black sea our fleet has also taken on the task of monitoring their activities
8677100 can nato indefinitely build up its forces and means there it turns out it cannot
8677101 if i leave georgia the russians will close our airspace and prevent me from returning home
8677102 remind me again are the iranians shiite or sunni never mind they are all glass now
8677103 i would have a very different opinion of tivo if its primary goal was to sell set top boxes
8677104 if that was their strategy id be quite negative but the company has been shifting its business strategy and we think theres enough runway left for them to start penetrating cable operators
8677105 i think the view is now with or without tivo people are going to watch television very differently and were focused on creating the right tools and the right business model so as these consumption changes occur there is a way for the industry to adopt to this and we avoid the issues that the newspaper industry now finds itself going through or the music business has gone through thats going to take a lot of work because while we see the industry beginning to understand that the speed with which this is attacked has an awful lot to do with the ability of the video business to avoid major dislocation
8677106 its clearly not good for the business but its not detrimental

8677140 its inspiring to look at what some of these women have done and to listen to some of their life stories
8677141 certainly had she been the democratic nominee that probably would have catapulted her higher
8677142 we expect to have an outcome from the process somewhere towards the end of september and at that time weve committed to provide further information to shareholders
8677143 based on current market conditions we are targeting growth in underlying eps earnings per share of at least 10 per cent for the 2008 09 financial year
8677144 if you have a look at the numbers overall they show that the domestic economy remains pretty robust
8677145 its down to the fact that the mining boom is having a significant impact but its not just mining you are seeing it across other areas as well with transportation and construction remaining quite strong
8677146 the important factor is that there are other economies around the world that are noticing a pretty significant slow down but were in a much more enviable position
8677147 it is reassuring for the reserve bank that the death of the australian economy is not at our doors yet
8677148 weve seen weakness in consumer sentiment weve seen weaker business sentiment numbers but really it hasnt translated into a weaker investment number yet
8677149 the supply side of the economy is pretty well primed to grow quite rapidly and absorb the inflationary pressures so wages will remain in check
8677150 both banks grew too fast in corporate and investment banking
8677151 the two companies will have to restructure their investment banks very deeply
8677152 the market is focused on the details of the capital increase and management didnt speak of it
8677153 youd expect that given the amount of economic gloom were seeing
8677154 if prices continue to fall at the pace they have done over the past three months then they will end the year down 15
8677155 with inflation running at 5 this means that residential real estate will have lost around a fifth of its value in real terms during 2008
8677156 dismantling the plant can be done but it involves a great loss of money
8677157 you can move some of the equipment but a lot would have been spent on the foundation
8677158 that will be a shame because some first time car buyers have not bought any other car because they were waiting for the nano and it may push the price up too
8677159 if you have a look at the numbers overall they show that the domestic economy remains pretty robust
8677160 its down to the fact that the mining boom is having a significant impact but its not just mining
8677161 you are seeing it across other areas as well with transportation and construction remaining quite strong
8677162 the important factor is that there are other economies around the world that are noticing a pretty significant slow down but were in a much more enviable position
8677163 it is reassuring for the reserve bank that the death of the australian economy is not at our doors yet
8677164 this sort of gives them some light at the end of the tunnel
8677165 weve seen weakness in consumer sentiment weve seen weaker business sentiment numbers but really it hasnt translated into a weaker investment number yet
8677166 really the supply side of the economy is pretty well primed to grow quite rapidly and absorb the inflationary pressures so wages will remain in check
8677167 it gives the reserve bank the option of making that rate cut come next week
8677168 i think theyve compounded the problem and i think thats why wayne swan really has been the worst treasurer in australias history
8677169 its just unbelievable that labor could trash business confidence so quickly and comprehensively
8677170 our businesses have all got nice momentum as we move into the new financial year
8677171 were expecting this half to be very solid the way things are panning out for us
8677172 theres nothing on our horizon that gives us any real cause for concern
8677173 i dont imagine the current environment would support that kind of outcome
8677174 were certainly looking more at single digits than high single digits in the current environment but were only a month in theres a long way to go
8677175 we copped equine influenza in the first half a few changes to the way you can run gaming machines in this state victoria but then all of a sudden lotteries kick in with a marvellous run
8677176 the momentum we are carrying into full year 2009 should guarantee a better result for the current half
8677177 the full year 2009 outlook is going to be clouded by the victorian government decision to fragment the lottery market delays in approvals for new games and tougher comparables in the second half
8677178 we only got the approvals for the games in nsw in april so for the first quarter we werent selling much into the nsw market at all
8677179 since those approvals have come through our sales have picked up significantly so were actually going into the second half obtaining a much greater market share of the overall new sales than we had in the first half
8677180 at the same time we have suffered from operator reluctance to purchase product ahead of the availability of our new viridian cabinet and gen7 platform and a larger library of content
8677181 if there was ever a re confirmation required that mcg essentially is a utility it came today with the company validating that 90 95 per cent of its current revenue was contracted over the next couple of years unfortunately unlike utilities mcg does not have earnings hedge against rising interest rate costs while we retain our hold rating on the stock with tp of 3 28 per share comparative valuation with its utility peers suggest downside risk to 0 73 per share
8677182 hcf has also committed to retaining the majority of muas staff for at least 12 months after the merger is approved
8677183 members will also gain access to the wider range of services offered by hcf including optical and dental clinics
8677184 financially stronger more efficient and flexible and even better placed to grow at a faster than industry rate
8677185 our policy is to rein in all fossil fuel subsidies
8677186 its much better to have a systemic approach rather than a piecemeal ad hoc approach
8677187 there were a lot of concerns about how fast the economy was slowing with this strong capital expenditure theres a possibility that the gdp for q2 will be better than expected
8677188 the rba may not be as aggressive in its rate cuts
8677189 that is why we saw such a sharp sell off
8677190 the market has taken it at face value and taken out some of the probability of rate cuts across the strip

8677333 what you always worry about when people havent played in a while is their short game
8677334 but his short game will have had more practice than any other part of his game and that will be a plus i dont think getting his swing back is going to be an issue
8677335 he made a few uncharacteristic mistakes for tiger that you dont see if hes played golf on a regular basis
8677336 when somebody lays off it doesnt really take em long to hit it good
8677337 it just takes a little while to get the feel for the game

8677342 it is vitally important that we better understand the mechanisms of disease transmission during blood transfusions so we can develop the most effective control measures and minimize human to human infections
8677343 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection this suggests that blood transfusion represents an efficient route of transmission for these diseases
8677344 since the results are consistent with what we know about human transmission the work helps justify the control measures put in place to safeguard human blood supplies it also shows that blood from bse and scrapie infected sheep could be used effectively in non human experiments to answer important questions such as which blood components are most heavily infected and to develop much needed diagnostic tests
8677345 the accusation last year was that it was a glitch in the game

8677656 large scale exports of fresh water would be a wealth creating idea for quebec and all of canada its urgent to look seriously at developing our blue gold
8677657 canadas precious fresh water resource belongs to the people and cannot be bundled and privatized at the whim of government and corporate interests
8677658 water is a fundamental human right and any attempt to divert or export it whether to the u s or saudi arabia must defer to whats in the broad canadian public interest
8677659 in a pre election cycle theres great pressure from corporations to allow the export of fresh water if quebec went ahead other provinces would have to follow
8677660 my bill was intended as a safety measure before a water crisis blows up ill bring it back if theres an election but 90 per cent of canadas fresh water is under provincial control and that complicates things

8677689 one townful of men and women would race on swarm into a shape and race off to be replaced by the next if deep below the spectacle there was an unspoken suggestion that it would be an extremely bad idea to go to war against this nation it never rose to the surface although one aerial travelling shot of fireworks exploding in sequence along the street leading up to the stadium displayed for us on screens inside was a ringer for bombing run footage from the vietnam war
8677690 we watch them both and ask ourselves what kind of society is it that can afford to make patterns out of its people india is hugely populous too but a delhi opening ceremony would be a more rambunctious affair nobody will ever surpass the mathematical majesty of that night in beijing and in retrospect that may be a good thing

8677695 i could make out little of the mens shot put on friday night for instance not because it was half a stadium away but because even through binoculars it appeared to be an international convention of bartenders staged inside a cloud of talcum powder
8677696 the best thing about the shot put was the cars after the shot landed and the distance had been measured the precious sphere would be retrieved by an official and placed in the cockpit of an automobile two feet long bright red with a tail fin in short the idealized vehicle that i drew during chemistry lessons when i was nine years old now it exists for real and there are two chinese fellows with the best job in the world who get to steer it back to the shot putting circle by remote control one question though will linger after the games are done the red supercars are equipped with windshields but why who needs to see out are there tiny drivers tucked in there bred specially for the event

8677719 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy

8677751 cest un rappel que nous vivons dans une zone sismique active et que les gens doivent tre pr par s subir des tremblements de terre et des tsunamis m me si cest tr s rare
8677752 la colombie britannique conna t des tremblements de terre tous les jours mais seul un petit nombre de ces secousses sont perceptibles et celles qui provoquent des d g ts sont encore moins nombreuses

8677757 this ship is a tangible reflection of the skill and craft of thousands of industry and shipyard workers and it clearly demonstrates the nations commitment to a strong national defense
8677758 as a result of numerous production and process improvements electric boat is delivering new hampshire to the navy in 71 months 16 months fewer than the lead ship
8677759 put another way we reduced the time between when the ship enters the water and when it is delivered from 14 months on the first ship of the class to less than 6 months on the new hampshire
8677760 like the previous ships of the class new hampshire has been designed specifically to incorporate emergent technologies that will provide new capabilities to meet new threats
8677761 this enables the virginia class to make unique and significant contributions to national security for decades to come
8677762 we dont need to thank you your lucky we let you play at all be happy with your minature and mousemat ungrateful dogs
8677763 oh yes mr smith your baby might have one liver or two at the moment its a bit of a guess
8677764 investing into renewables is one of the strategic measures we are taking to respond to the adopted energy climactic package of the eu
8677765 we were not told anything about that and these flights are expensive enough already
8677766 whether to fly carbon neutral was a decision which was left up to each of the delegates themselves
8677767 i think you will find that the vast majority will not have paid but we as awepa are developing a policy which will allow our members to fly carbon neutral which will be in place for the next meeting early next year
8677768 the un is working towards a mechanism in which all emissions for un conferences will be offset for now its up to the parties but as the un we would very much like that all of these conferences would be carbon neutral
8677769 discussions in a more comfortable environment as well as to limit the use of air conditioning and thereby reduce greenhouse gas emissions
8677770 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden on to hard pressed british families and businesses
8677771 its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8677772 the taxpayers alliance figures are seriously flawed because they are based on a discredited approach to calculating the cost of climate change and in fact green taxes have fallen as a proportion of overall taxes since labour came to power
8677773 green taxes are one of the key policies needed to prevent dangerous climate change that would cost the uk billions of pounds and ruin lives
8677774 tax should be about trying to change behaviour and not just about abstract revenue raising
8677775 its the governments fault that people have lost faith in green taxes their money goes into a black hole and they dont see the benefits
8677776 greens would bring in measures like making free insulation available to everyone which would dramatically reduce fuel bills for families and reduce the amount they pay in green taxes as well
8677777 a serious and equitable response to climate change will require rich countries to pay billions in public funds to help poor countries develop in a sustainable low carbon manner so why have the eu which like to claim global leadership in the response to climate change turned up with empty pockets again
8677778 we were disappointed in the decision made by midlothian council as we believe that auchencorth moss is the ideal location for the wind farm and a fantastic opportunity to help tackle the global threat of climate change
8677779 we are now satisfied that our proposal will comply with scottish government and local plan policy with minimal impact on the environment and the local population

8677785 the floods were a wrath of nature it is a natural disaster caused due to heavy rains

8677787 der fast ununterbrochene anstieg der scheidungsraten seit den 60er jahren ist erst einmal zu ende vielleicht gehen die zahlen noch ein bisschen zur ck aber es gibt noch keinen trend nach unten

8677794 last thursday they were getting nazi salutes on the streets and plenty of abuse
8677795 people have been walking up to the wardens and shaking their hands and saying well done keep up the good work
8677796 they have got so many calls of support from people all around the country and they have got a letter of support from their work colleagues at the council
8677797 some people just have the attitude the wardens are there to be abused and its wrong
8677798 if we didnt get that contribution the rates would have to go up by 567 000 to maintain the roading budget

8677806 because seat belts can reduce the risk of injury and death in crashes by more than 50 there is a critical need for interventions to increase seat belt use by teens as both drivers and passengers
8677807 this research reinforces why state farm is actively involved in advocating for laws that help prevent injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes its clear from these findings that primary seat belt laws for all occupants would help us accomplish that goal

8677824 we pride ourselves on our performance and weve played some good cricket over the last two years
8677825 and the way of performing in the last two games is nowhere near where we should be performing
8677826 it is a changing side but theres no excuse to perform the way we have the pressure is now on england to win the series
8677827 theyve been in a situation a few times before and not followed through and weve been in a situation where weve been 2 0 down in a series and come back to win it so i think its going to be a hard tough couple of games

8678008 oh what is the malted liquor what gets you drunker quicker what comes in bottles or in cans beer
8678009 im not going to actually discuss it again but for the record four years ago bush stood on a circular stage almost identical to the one obama will use and yes it had stately pillars behind it get over it its the norm
8678010 todays talking point will be the elaborate stage obama will make his acceptance speech on
8678011 4 years ago george bush was already the president and he never said anything like he was going to make the rising oceans slow and heal the planet

8678026 while florida voters like crist it is probably safe to say that they prefer the first term governor stay in tallahassee and do the job he was elected to do less than two years ago
8678027 selecting joe lieberman could surprisingly have a negative effect in florida in 2000 liebermans presence on the democratic ticket almost delivered the state to al gore because of strong jewish voter support in south florida eight years later however many democrats are not happy with liebermans abandoning of the senates democratic caucus and 25 of republican voters do not want him on the gop ticket with apparently limited cross over appeal and the risk of losses among the fragile gop base a lieberman selection would be dangerous

8678159 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8678160 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8678161 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8678162 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8678163 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

8678169 if someone has doubts as far as my motivation is concerned go ahead
8678170 i have to remember that this is the reason i dont like getting high
8678171 lets just say im glad that sampras is on my team
8678172 its easy to say yes to this kind of thing to get together with a very small group of people who you have mutual respect for because of what we were able to accomplish there are not a lot of people who can say that
8678173 im delighted to play with these guys once again and to play with john everyone knows the matches we had in the past
8678174 there is nothing major to feel concerned about his personal secretary tenzin taklha said
8678175 sometimes in our relentless efforts to find the person we love we fail to
8678176 it the criticism just doesnt make sense to me either the moment i read the screenplay i knew it was an important story and as its a true tale of heroic resistance to one of the great villains of history i cant imagine that people wont want to see it
8678177 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page if anyone has any questions id be happy to answer them as best i can if anyone has any comments im glad to listen
8678178 i have a fairly specific idea of what the first 15 pages of the screenplay will be and no idea what will happen on pages 16 through 130 i have very strong feelings about the internet and its effect on our national culture but frankly those feelings are being countered by the sophistication kindness curiosity and wit of the posts in this site

8678182 theres a specific law the family entertainment and copyright act that deals specifically with pre release material the rationale being that leaking this material prevents the owner of the copyright from getting the first release
8678183 the first release is always the one thats going to get the most profit for the person who owns the copyright to take that first opportunity from someone is more serious and is usually pursued criminally to try to prevent that from happening again
8678184 in my opinion and im assuming its his first offense
8678185 i wouldnt expect significant jail time but i would expect a fine and some jail time its a felony not a misdemeanor and the federal courts have guidelines depending on how much profit was made the seriousness of the crime and whether the person cooperated
8678186 he may end up getting probation i would be shocked if he got anywhere near three years in prison
8678187 the band is in the position now where they can start a civil action and they would be successful
8678188 but how are their fans feeling about this theyll have their own public relations issues as to whether theyre going to start an action here
8678189 i always said that the more that axl and geffen jerked around trying to figure out how to release this finally finished album that weve all been waiting over 13 years for
8678190 the greater the chances would be that it would slip out of a pressing plant or office somewhere and wind up in the hands of some asshole with a blog so hey i told you so

8678202 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8678203 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8678204 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8678205 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8678206 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8678207 we were told that the first president bush was born on third base and thought he had hit a triple well this president bush was born on third base and stole second

8678218 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8678219 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8678220 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8678221 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8678222 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8678223 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8678224 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8678225 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8678226 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8678227 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8678228 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8678229 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8678230 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8678231 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8678232 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8678233 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8678234 who are open to doing something on the production side
8678235 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8678236 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8678237 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8678238 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8678239 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

8678243 we respect freedom and tolerance but the festival is a kind of provocation since it is taking place during ramadan
8678244 bosnia is a conservative society and i doubt that such an event would be accepted
8678245 a small group of people promoting ideas which do not represent basic values
8678246 weve been preparing the project for the past year and i would not spend my time only to provoke someone

8678250 this life is a short journey how can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on earth before you pack those bags for the very last time
8678251 if this isnt a reminder of how short life is i dont know what else could drive that point home
8678252 i could be doing so much more with my life with that in mind im going to come up with my own list of things i want to accomplish before i die and set out to achieve them sometimes you just gotta live like you were dying
8678253 let this be a lesson to all of us dont tempt fate i will never make a 100 list bucket list or any other list of things to do before i die it almost assures you of an unfortunate accident
8678254 if they want to do it and if they are talented enough i would support them
8678255 i understand there are a few other people using facebook pages under my name which i find more flattering than creepy but this is me i dont know how i can prove that but feel free to test me
8678256 i figured a good first step in my preparation would be finding out what facebook is so ive started this page
8678257 not sure if this is or is not the norm but i just received my brand new iphone here in the uk and once it had been activated on itunes i found that the home screen the screen you can personalize with a photo already had a photo set against it
8678258 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8678259 i think its a kind of personal touch its nice maybe every phone that gets a full quality test should have its testers picture taken and left on there and the working conditions look pretty good
8678260 in some cases operators are charging you for a call of one minute two seconds what they can charge you for two minutes this leads to overcharging on average of 24 percent for calls made and 19 percent for calls received
8678261 the regulation of billing increments within the eurotariff or any other roaming tariff would amount to micro management and would risk further erosion of competitive differentiation in the market
8678262 billing increments are a point of differentiation that operators can use to appeal to customers with different preferences
8678263 this is an issue national regulators have recommended the european commission to address if you tackle this issue you have to tackle it in eu legislation this is something the european commission will consider in the weeks to come

8678271 there is a feeling in much of the it community that mckinnon is being treated as a scapegoat by the u s authorities that because he was arrested shortly after 9 11 that the u s agencies felt that they had to send out a strong message that hacking was not going to be tolerated and so they appear to have been aiming to come down on him like a ton of bricks
8678272 the strong message is if you mess with a u s military computer expect them to be ruthless in their pursuit of you

8678298 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care so there you have it voila problem solved
8678299 so instead of producing worthless statistics that people fling around in vacuous editorials and pointless debates the census bureau should produce meaningful numbers identifying all of the sources of funds people will draw on if they need medical care
8678300 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured
8678301 hey lets simply redefine things so we dont have to come up with a plan and by our definition we can lie and say everyone is insured regardless if people are dying in emergency rooms if we are incapable which we the mccain family are we simply change definitions to fit our needs

8678376 the meeting felt the need for a strong presence in delhi to mount pressure on the center and federation will fulfill this need we will bring more such parties and movement in our fold and intensify our fight both at the political and peoples level in the prevailing political situation in the country individual fight is not enough the federation will play a key role in the national politics
8678377 but after achieving those goals the respective parties left the front now we have decided to fight from the platform of this federation for other small states
8678378 but people are being fooled in the name of politics the prime minister is saying that it can not be done with out a proper resolution from the state assembly when legally there is no need for any such resolution
8678379 from 1956 up to 1969 under gentlemans agreement we had a telangana regional committee which had power of making its own budget but it vanished in 1952 we had mulki rules they disappeared after we fight we emerged weaker because of the political betrayal if all these parties agree the federation can be turned in to a federal party at the national level in the future
8678380 kashmir ladakh and jammu three separate independent entities are all great cultures linguistic social and great geographical identities this reorganization should have been done in 1947 itself when we acceded to the union of india
8678381 we have no grudge against the people of kashmir but the time has come when state of jammu and kashmir needs to be reorganized on the basis of their cultural linguistic geographical and historical identities

8678386 with all of the wars gas shortages a looming depression and no more olympics to pretend arent boring things are pretty bleak we wondered if our world would look any less depressing if viewed through the eyes of a five year old
8678387 get to the front of the store before i kill someone
8678388 virtually everyone weve talked do says they have no information about the job a judge is doing and that they are voting blindly
8678389 anything that gets good information to the public is something we support
8678390 well see which guys will step up but thats why we recruited them
8678391 we have high expectations of finding oil in the dreki area since scientific research has indicated that valuable oil resources may be found there
8678392 we therefore urge all parties interested in new oil fields in northern areas to attend the conference in reykjavik
8678393 at the conference we will go through geological data on the area as well as inform on taxation and financial conditions
8678394 rolling over in his grave that his son is speaking up for a republican
8678395 no one ever said we did things the right way
8678396 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8678397 i am here tonight as a proud mother a proud democrat a proud senator from new york a proud american and a proud supporter of barack obama
8678398 whether you voted for me or you voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
8678399 we are on the same team and none of us can sit on the sidelines this is a fight for the future and its a fight we must win no way no how no mccain
8678400 recalls can take time and the commission felt that time was of the essence and that warning the public about this product was so important that we could not wait until a recall was announced
8678401 it is now clear what the foreseeable danger with this product is
8678402 the fact that we have put out this warning pretty much has determined that this is a product that should not be used by consumers
8678403 has refused to cooperate with the government and recall the products sfca maintains that it is not responsible for products previously manufactured by simplicity inc
8678404 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
8678405 it wasnt what i would call an endorsement of russias recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia
8678406 the active role of russia in promoting peace and cooperation in the given region
8678407 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its territorial integrity
8678408 it wasnt what i would call an endorsement of russias recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia
8678409 the active role of russia in promoting peace and cooperation in the given region
8678410 yes there are so many things that we want to do more than we can do with the resources
8678411 ja genau es ist dunkel so muss es sein so ist es richtig
8678412 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8678413 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8678414 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8678415 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8678416 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8678417 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8678418 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8678419 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8678420 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8678421 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8678422 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8678423 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8678424 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8678425 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8678426 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8678427 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8678428 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8678429 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8678430 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8678431 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8678432 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8678433 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

8678439 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8678440 she reminded everyone of the goals and ideals of the democratic party and that the democrats need to get behind obama
8678441 im not sure she convinced me hes the right person but hes the only candidate at this point
8678442 we need someone who can balance the continuing challenges we face as minorities
8678443 what a beautiful thing when in america have you seen this kind of love for a black man
8678444 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government
8678445 we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy people are suffering
8678446 that is the mandate that he mugabe was given by the sadc southern african development community regional bloc and he is not going to stop forming that new cabinet the mdc are not serious at all
8678447 you will be killing the talks once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
8678448 formally we are going to write a letter to the facilitator south african president thabo mbeki about the breaches that have occurred

8679002 we put in place a clear commitment to serve others the lost the least the broken
8679003 were trying to break the cycle of consumerist church of serving only our needs
8679004 for the first time in the history of the church we did not run a church service on sunday morning
8679005 we deployed 3 000 people in the city to serve
8679006 the god of mission has a church in the world
8679007 god was the primary missionary and he sent his son to the world he was incarnational he showed up in the flesh and we are to be incarnational we are to go out not in we are to align our lives with the mission of jesus
8679008 if we really want people to understand lets give them a week a month at least one sunday to just do it
8679009 people come back from those experiences saying now we get it
8679010 when you displace yourself and put yourself in the position to serve others you allow yourself to be put in a fast track for missional discipleship a big piece of the puzzle for us is getting outside of the building
8679011 our message up front is die to yourself and come save the world
8679012 we talk about courageous leadership a lot but we do not talk about courageous pa tience
8679013 we are talking about turning an institution thats been around for 130 years
8679014 the mission of god and his movement has moved beyond the structure of our church when people start going on mission trips its 1 500 they may not give to the church we are having to reengineer and reallocate our programs staff and budget if its not about an institution and dragging people to a big crowd it impacts the way you look at your buildings the way you do programs they way you build or dont build
8679015 if you have a staff structure organization and schedule that is attractional you have to figure out what we need to abandon what doesnt fit us anymore in the new church god wants us to be
8679016 i firmly believe that a kingdom church will always be on the journey of shedding things that arent as important for this time and that is hard to go through
8679017 this is scary and wonderful and painful and feels good and all those opposite kind of items
8679018 well thats a shame that you wont be able to get scholarships for college
8679019 quiero invitar al se or presidente a que saquemos esa bandera blanca

8679021 we selected motorola for this wimax project after a thorough evaluation and several field trials
8679022 motorola has extensive wimax experience its system is easy to set up and requires minimum installation footprint which in the process helps reduce deployment time and lowers overall operational cost we are also impressed by motorolas ability to provide advanced features like mimo b in a live system these features will ensure a smooth network upgrade when we need to increase system capacity in the future

8679024 the entrance of intel into client and enterprise ssds will expand the market in the near term as another credible ssd supplier joins the ranks of samsung stec toshiba and potential challengers sandisk and micron
8679025 however longer term intel poses a serious competitive threat as a stand alone supplier or as a possible partner for example seagate has publicly stated that it is interested in pursuing enterprise grade ssd
8679026 sandisk also would be challenged by intels presence because sandisk has been slow to get its next generation ssd to market and does not have the enterprise relationships necessary to quickly penetrate the enterprise segment
8679027 this is especially true because sandisks strength is in retail and there will be limited traction of ssds in retail for at least the next three years
8679028 weve refined our manufacturing techniques and redesigned our low density ssds to get what the low priced pc market is looking for in the way of improved cost performance and availability
8679029 we are very pleased to establish this relationship with solarfun which will support our growing needs for the rapidly expanding activities in q cells international in this case primarily outside of europe we aim to combine our high efficiency cells and solarfuns competitive flexible and high quality manufacturing base for solar modules to create high efficiency and cost effective module solutions for these systems we believe that close cooperation between the two parties will provide each with opportunities to grow and compete effectively in the burgeoning field of renewable solar energy
8679030 we are investigating early market applications of hydrogen for the department of energy
8679031 we are identifying applications where the cost and technology curve are such that we can get fuel cells into the hands of users now
8679032 fuel cell vehicles and power generation in residential settings are further down the road so we are looking are near term applications such as materials handling equipment as well as near term consumer electronics applications
8679033 the military is especially interested in materials handling equipment as an early adopter for fuel cell technology
8679034 hydrogen will help with the militarys battlefield readiness because it avoids the big logistical issues of getting gasoline onto the battlefield
8679035 infineon introduced the first generation of ewlb in 2007 as a dynamic technology that offered small package dimensions improved electrical and thermal performance and maximum connection density for wireless applications
8679036 our manufacturing partnership with stats chippac ensures we will be able to expand the number of highly integrated wafer level packages manufactured with ewlb technology
8679037 john thomas is an fbi mole he recently told us that he saw you coming and going from rezkos office a lot and three other sources told us that you and rezko spoke on the phone daily
8679038 you told us in november 2006 that your best estimate was that rezko raised somewhere between 50 000 and 60 000 during your political career since then your campaigns given back 157 000 in rezko related contributions
8679039 the tribune web site is saying that you told them 250 000
8679040 us attorney patrick fitzgerald does not make a habit of destroying pubic officials by listing them in indictments for no reason and the only two political candidates identified as receiving campaign money from operation board games kickback schemes are illinois governor rod blagojevich and the us senator from illinois barack obama
8679041 the last thing sen barack obama and gov rod blagojevich needed was that letter written by convicted illinois influence peddler tony rezko promising hed never rat out his pals
8679042 this is a crime that involves the highest levels of power in illinois
8679043 as his sentencing nears pressure is mounting on tony rezko to cooperate with federal investigations into some of the highest profile politicians in the state including gov blagojevich
8679044 now sources tell the chicago sun times that rezko has been seen at the federal courthouse as many as a dozen times since his june conviction hes been held since then at the metropolitan correctional center in downtown chicago
8679045 if rezkos cooperating that would be a major development in
8679046 shes voting for republican john mccain and had nothing nice to say about the obamas
8679047 what about the kids i asked adorable she agreed well i said michelle raised them

8679074 if some people within the church are doing business with the sacraments then it is unfortunate that is an abuse of the principles we should beware such abuses do not become standards in our church
8679075 money should never be a hindrance to somebody receiving the sacraments and if that is the case because the person concerned cannot afford the minimum of fcfa 500 for infant baptism for instance then he or she is still to start believing in god
8679076 the church is there for the poor she carries out the mission of christ who came to uplift the lives of the poor if the church does not do something in favour of all its poor it is not because the will is not there but simply because the means is limited
8679077 our churches are no longer run from europe it is little tokens like this that make the church grow
8679078 only infants receive baptism without receiving doctrine classes the rest must attend doctrine classes old people need just daily instructions in the faith for some time to enable them know more about the sacrament they want to receive
8679079 if one is given an opportunity to learn the churchs doctrine one must make time to attend these classes at all cost
8679080 the church needs our personal presence it does not suffice for a candidate to buy a doctrine booklet and study at home explanations are very important and these can only be given during doctrine classes
8679081 making the olympic games successful is the ardent wish of the chinese people
8679082 the draw is the draw theres nothing you can do
8679083 even after seeing the teams that we will face you still never know whether the first phase will be easy or difficult
8679084 our first objective is to get through the group the second objective is to try to do this as winners of group b
8679085 of course we are very motivated and confident we want to start playing the champions league as soon as possible however the championship starts on saturday and the concentration is all on the game against sampdoria
8679086 we know all of them pretty well for different reasons its not easy but theyre all fairly close by so there are no long trips there are no easy ties when you look down the groups so you take it as it comes
8679087 ye there are different circumstances with marseille we beat them away but lost at home we know them well weve played psv a few times atletico we know for different reasons from buying fernando torres were just delighted to be in it
8679088 with our spanish contingent the atletico fixtures will be important games if there was one club from pot four you wanted to avoid it would be atletico
8679089 the gareth barry transfer didnt happen thats all there is to it
8679090 if i had to give a name i would go with juventus
8679091 they strike me as more hungry to win then the other teams are
8679092 i believe the criticism is excessive but obviously they could have strengthened the squad even more especially in the midfield
8679093 maybe there could be a bit more quality but there is definitely sustenance
8679094 the champions league is more complicated and certain teams in europe still have more quality then juventus
8679095 i believe that milan have extraordinary players capable of making the difference at any moment but there are too many questions
8679096 our away form has been poor in recent years in europe so we will need to work on that to get something from this group if we do that then we could go far its good to draw the champions of europe hopefully well get through to the next round again
8679097 theyre going to be fantastic games scotland and england rivalries all hold for a great atmosphere and a great game
8679098 im confident of being fit and ready for that i should be ready to go the week before the champions league starts
8679099 every game will be difficult the villarreal games are massive there will be added pressure in the aalborg ties as well though villarreal are very technically gifted so we will have to be wary even from home
8679100 we seem to have a habit of drawing the champions barcelona now manchester united but its good for the fans
8679101 gordon strachan celtic manager has done well in europe in the past weve beaten the likes of benfica ac milan and manchester united so we will hope to go through but there are no easy byes
8679102 aalborg are an unknown quantity from our point of view
8679103 were looking for a little strengthening whether we will get it we will announce it weve won the league three times in a row well go for a fourth
8679104 its poor in fact i watched a lot of italian football last year and it is very average no one is watching it
8679105 inter have just coasted home for the past couple of seasons and i mean coasted
8679106 i dont see the italians putting up much of a go this year only inter have a chance and that is because of the mourinho factor
8679107 its not an easy group but it never is at this level the problem for arsene is the travel i think tough games local fans in good stadia but we are confident of progressing
8679108 they are long trips we are used to it though it could have been worse it could have been easier
8679109 fenerbahce will be stiff competition but we must continue our great form at home we have only lost once since the move weve never lost to porto but saying that we have never won in kiev
8679110 of course it was difficult because it was up to me and five players who were chosen to shoot but you have to concentrate on yourself and this is what i try to do
8679111 for me persnally its an amazing achievement to get this award this evening
8679112 to be a great defender you need a lot of attributes to read the game very well be quick strong good in the air and you also need good team mates around you which i have bundles of so im happy
8679113 when you see the players that youre against theres some world class players in there ive been amongst them for three years its good to finally win one
8679114 work i think manchester had a great season and i scored many goals
8679115 i feel very proud because my position is winger and to win the best forward is good for me it gives me ambition to work good and better thank you everyone who voted for me thank you to my team mates and good night
8679116 i feel very proud very good to win this because the champions league is one of the best every player likes to play this competition and to be the best
8679117 for me is great thank you everyone thank you my team mates thank you to everyone to all the players its great its good for me i feel very happy
8679118 mi spiace uscire di scena in questo modo innanzitutto per rispetto alla lampre che ha creduto in me
8679119 mi spiace uscire di scena in questo modo innanzitutto per rispetto al mio team ha detto il corridore alla lampre mi hanno ingaggiato un anno fa alla soglia dei 39 anni dimostrando una grande fiducia in me spero di aver ripagato in misura adeguata la loro scommessa

8679127 el d a de hoy nos hemos movilizado de manera inmediata los estudiantes universitarios de la central para denunciar que este paro de los transportistas es un paro pol tico es un paro conspirativo es un paro que pretende detener el avance del desarrollo del s el 28 de septiembre fecha en la que se realizar el referendo constitucional
8679128 es evidente que frente a la corriente de cambio que hoy mayoritariamente est triunfando y que efectivamente frente a la posibilidad de la transformaci n del pa s hoy por orden de los socialcristianos los dirigentes de transportistas que son ligados con ese partido evidentemente quieren chantajear al gobierno y desestabilizar este proyecto de cambio
8679129 los estudiantes universitarios no vamos a permitir ceder al chantaje de los transportistas en torno al alza de pasajes ya que en estos momentos ni la poblaci n estudiantil ni la poblaci n en general tenemos la capacidad de pago para poder insistir en ese incremento del alza de pasajes
8679130 por eso es que nosotros afirmamos que la derecha hoy en este momento se encuentra desesperada y por lo tanto est queriendo causar un caos en el pa s

8679152 my lack of formal training in fashion allows me to present a fresh take on garment making
8679153 my fascination with fashion began when i realized that everything that fashion stands for is overrated and underrated for very different reasons
8679154 fashion designs are usually first conceived flat on paper my paperdoll collection above strives to retain that flatness ive tried to avoid distender of any kind pleats gathers etc to emphasize the intrinsic flatness of fabric so much so that they have come to resemble the flatpack lifestyle we are familiar with the simple form is reminiscent of the shift dresses of the 60s i am fascinated by how the flat garment radically transforms as it falls against the contours of the human body
8679155 yumumu is mandarin for rain wood wood the three chinese radicals come together to form the lin character of my name their elemental nature echoes the undated appeal of the designs also i like how it sounds like the mumblings of our universal language babytalk

8679167 upon its release for its sound defined by singer michael stipes cryptic lyrics and guitarist peter bucks jangly guitar style
8679168 characterized the quieter introverted side of the first wave of alternative rock in the united states the sound was new at the time though not stepping beyond the constructs of traditional rock music the guitars have a bright ring like chimes that brought on comparisons to the byrds and the bass guitar has the bright punchy sound of the rickenbacker favored by mike mills mills carries much of the melodic element of the music on the bass contributing to the moody sound of early r e m albums also contributing to this sound is the distant singing of michael stipe whose obscure lyrics sung indistinctly lend to the mystery and depth of the music
8679169 attending appointments is the offenders personal responsibility and this system in no way replaces that

8679183 considering the problems that have been demonstrated with these dyes along with the fact that they are easily replaced with natural colorings its sad that the fda is doing nothing to get them out of food
8679184 meanwhile doctors are prescribing powerful drugs like ritalin and adderall to undo the damage being done in part by the increasingly unnatural food supply
8679185 the food industry wont fix its american foods until the fda tells them to
8679186 unfortunately the fda asserts on the basis of its misreading of a 25 year old report that there is no evidence that dyes affect behavior if companies like mars kellogg and mcdonalds were responsible they would immediately begin switching to safe natural colorings in the united states

8679189 she estimates that at least 30 of the nearly 400 indian children brought into australia in the last 10 to 15 years were trafficked
8679190 many many places i looked my husband traveled everywhere looking i was all the time crying for my daughter
8679191 the social stigma of the child being born outside marriage
8679192 will work very closely with federal and state agencies to investigate these claims
8679193 the australian government needs to appoint some kind of investigation about all the children who came through this agency look at their background look into their documents
8679194 these children are going to want to find their parents the communication is being lost
8679195 i was so happy we both went to the police station and it was midnight when we got there they took us into separate rooms and showed us photos from the mss books separately we both picked out zabeen
8679196 when she knows that she has her parents here im sure that she will come looking for us
8679197 there isnt sufficient information available and nobody capable of giving us the advice we need to sort it out
8679198 show why there cannot be any relaxation of standards when it comes to verifying the identity of children adopted under the inter country program
8679199 is endeavoring to improve australia wide practice in respect to overseas adoption
8679200 so far we have managed to keep this all away from the children we wont allow pictures of them on websites we are always wary of strangers and concerned about suspicious looking cars its a constant nagging worry and you feel so helpless
8679201 we are aware that mss are not currently licensed by the central authority in india to undertake inter country adoptions
8679202 i trusted my staff because i asked them if there is anything please tell me they are promising on the heads of their children
8679203 asfc has had no reason to doubt that those funds do reach and benefit the children for whom they are intended
8679204 we would definitely like to find out what has happened
8679205 you are telling us more than we have ever been told
8679206 if the children get wind that their placement may be in jeopardy it would be very concerning
8679207 a very splendid thing and when it runs off the rails its extremely sad
8679208 some people say why are they bothered about one child but payment for one child sustains the whole philosophy of making children a commodity
8679209 i wouldnt like to be acting for the indian parents
8679210 you might get pro bono lawyers but the bottom line would be the best interests of the child and that may be a one way street if you compared the position of the child in australia returning to poverty in india you would have to be a pretty dramatic judge to send a child back to the slums
8679211 let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for he who promised is faithful
8679212 is this really for me will this really ever happen

8679297 but how can she say a bracha without any clothes
8679298 every night religious women are saying brachot wearing no clothes
8679299 im getting to the point where i just love wild things now i dont know why
8679300 i thought it was the most wonderful thing ive ever done the super style was my favorite because you didnt have to hold on to anything and your arms were free it was like flying
8679301 my favorite part of the day was watching peoples reactions watching dad everyone was wishing him a happy birthday
8679302 were here to provide fun and adventure experiences to the general public with the zip lines we have added something that falls into our adventure activities lexicon while also taking us into exciting new territory

8679304 you have to go way back to the middle of the last recession august 2001 to find a changewave survey projecting this big of an it spending downturn
8679305 me and symantec are like me and fords we just dont get along
8679306 ive had bad experiences with their virus protection products in the past and wouldnt you know soon after i started at baja users were coming to me with infections that symantec had missed
8679307 we were experiencing difficulties on a number of workstations that symantec just wasnt resolving so i needed to find a new solution fast
8679308 our licenses were running out so the timing was good i really didnt want to spend more money on protection that wasnt working
8679309 we were paying so much for our symantec licenses i couldnt believe that the free edition of avg caught the problems that symantec didnt
8679310 as soon as i installed the software it identified the virus that had been causing us trouble and then found three more
8679311 i needed a quote quickly so that i could get the new protection in place before our symantec license ran out and left us with even less protection
8679312 we wanted to get avg up and running as soon as possible to make sure the network stayed virus free
8679313 i searched online for avg suppliers and found walling data
8679314 i liked the idea of working with them because theyre relatively close to us in north carolina i was also impressed with the range of support options they offered an important aspect when youre dealing as i was with distributed networks and a brand new product
8679315 what do i like most about avg well it just seems to work
8679316 after dealing with the hassles of symantec avg was a welcome change for baja broadband and walling datas assistance made the whole process very easy
8679317 honestly everything happened so efficiently when we purchased our licenses i had no need for support
8679318 the initial installation was completely trouble free but i may well give them a call and talk through a few options for tweaking the system when i get a moment
8679319 even the free edition of avg was able to contain and clean up the viruses that symantec didnt
8679320 when i saw that i knew we had a winner in avg

8679359 i knew them and their so called institute very well such a beautiful name but an institute should have doctors and professors in order to conduct islamic research and anyone with educational qualifications is with us
8679360 dissatisfied with something offended had family problems or were ex criminals
8679361 what they wanted was unclear but some who wanted to profess islam actively were used to destabilise the situation in kabardino balkaria and through that russia
8679362 when our jamaat was formed we tried to find a golden mean and combine a call for peace with jihad
8679363 in reality this was not a golden mean but an attempt to combine two contradictory things peace and war
8679364 support muslims and take part in jihad or support kafirs and betray your faith there is no third way
8679365 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8679366 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8679367 jackson hattiesburg laurel and all areas along the coast its a little mexico im not against people trying to make living i have a compassion for those folks but at the same time the taxpayers of mississippi shouldnt be subsidizing a plant that wont even hire their own workers
8679368 the union uses the tactic of saying immigration was coming and the members of the union would not be taken
8679369 that doesnt justify but it certainly explains why they might be hiring individuals who show up and say ill work for you
8679370 i was forwarded the daily news articles which are so bad as to be actionable if you need to me to do anything let me know give jed a hug for me
8679371 i practically fell to the floor when i heard what happened to my boy
8679372 the reality hasnt set in but im worried i dont know whether my son is dead or alive
8679373 i was right there in the delivery when jed was born
8679374 eric became extremely jealous of the time i was spending with our baby
8679375 they were supposed to come back by noon tuesday instead of sunday
8679376 but by 12 15 i was already starting to get worried i knew something was up
8679377 this is to inform you that jed will not be returning to new york today
8679378 because of your threats against my life i am not sharing further information regarding jeds and my whereabouts other than to say that we are safe and well i will arrange to meet with you once you come to israel to finally discuss with me the welfare and upbringing of our beautiful son
8679379 but i was wrong i told people he was capable of doing anything but no one listened to me
8679380 i left because jed was the one who was suffering
8679381 i believe my son in desperation found these laws and took the biggest risk of his life
8679382 he could reach out to us to his son at any time he has chosen not to that is not putting his son first
8679383 i pray to god the babys safe but this is a crazy man
8679384 he kidnapped my son hell stop at nothing to hurt me and my family
8679385 i know how to use the google i talked to erics mom there will be an update
8679386 its the most wonderful feeling in the world to have him back
8679387 daddy daddy daddy and he was kissing me and kissing everybody
8679388 you are not his mother and you are not welcome here
8679389 devastated by the whole process by the breakup of the relationship by the custody dispute
8679390 its the most wonderful feeling in the world to have him back
8679391 daddy daddy daddy and he was kissing me and kissing everybody
8679392 its the most wonderful feeling in the world to have him back
8679393 i was really so happy to see he was ok and well he was a little dirty and hadnt been bathed but none of that mattered
8679394 they adopted jedidiah from one of glazers friends who gave him to the couple at birth
8679395 the earlier photo i said hyett looked like a dildo with teeth hes got crazy eyes too
8679396 why are so many jewish guys gay what really can somebody find me one please
8679397 so very happy for this outcome lets hope extradition is on the tanle in this case this guy could use a year or two at rikers
8679398 obama does not meet the qualifications to be president of the united states
8679399 a day earlier philip berg filed a motion for a temporary restraining order in federal court in philadelphia questioning the authenticity of obamas hawaii birth certificate and claiming the illinois senator was actually born in kenya according to court papers

8679404 we created the il rts to provide todays solar cell structures with a simple cost effective alternative to low bow pastes and technologies

8679406 we want our customers to be happy with their order and will do everything in our power to make their purchase an enjoyable experience
8679407 jack stole my heart the minute i saw his sad brown eyes whenever he would come out of his kennel to go outside he would come and sit in front of me with his head down to be petted he would follow me around the courtyard and would accompany me as i worked in the boarding area
8679408 since jack was too sick to be sent to maine with his sister and the other shelter dogs i decided that if i could find an apartment that allowed dogs i would adopt him as luck would have it i found a beautiful house where jack would be welcome and on the very day that the other foster dogs were put on the transport truck headed to maine i adopted him
8679409 jack is now two years old and recently had his annual exam for his vaccinations he still sees the veterinarian who saved him when he was so sick and she gave him a clean bill of health he is heartworm free and has no lasting damage to his heart i am thrilled that our time together will be much longer than anyone originally thought
8679410 mr protocol really likes treaties so we got him this treaty instead of a card so if you could just all the other countries have already signed it
8679411 and now if you could just initial here and here and here and oh you can ignore all that stuff about sulfides thats just an inside joke
8679412 its rewarding to be recognized for our growth and contribution to both healthcare and the economy especially alongside so many prestigious companies
8679413 by addressing healthcares most pressing needs with innovative and practical solutions were able to sustain rapid yet steady growth and are well positioned for another strong year
8679414 scientists have known for years yams contain high amounts of steroidal glycosides which are naturally occurring steroid alkaloids
8679415 listen some oranges contain 30 mg of vitamin c others contain over 300 mgs whos to say the trelawny yam isnt just chock full of natural steroids and if you eat enough of them you will get a steroid like effect
8679416 the problem for scientists is that we could never liberate all those powerful steroid alkaloids and make them usable until now
8679417 we just got finished with a clinical trial study on naturally occurring steroidal glycosides and the results were staggering
8679418 what we were able to do is cleave the sugar molecule off the steroidal glycoside and liberate its enormous nitrogen retaining effect
8679419 and as everybody knows steroids dramatically increase nitrogen in the muscle cell making it bigger stronger and faster
8679420 im using it on some of my pro ball players and theyre getting huge steroid like results with no steroid side effects some of them are getting so big and strong their agents have phoned me swearing up and down im giving them real juice i had one young player who gained 13 pounds of muscle in 30 days and lowered his 60 yard dash time by 3 seconds
8679421 mess up even one step in the slightest and you are left with an ineffective product weve spent years researching this and we finally have it down to an exact science

8679429 halloween has evolved from one night of begging for treats into a true holiday season creating a bigger demand for trendy costumes earlier in the year
8679430 people have begun shopping for holiday costumes sooner in the year and celebrating longer the challenge for consumers is to get the most popular costumes for their children before they sell out

8679436 i think its fair to say that many if not most women these days dont settle for smooth political speak when it comes to their health care needs
8679437 we are so pleased that the health insurance advocate show is predominately listened to by women because national health care will absolutely take away many important aspects of the american health care system women have come to rely on lets see how many american women are willing to wait six months for a mammogram if obama care starts
8679438 there is no doubt that the health insurance advocate radio show is a compelling one of kind program
8679439 listeners are attracted to the health insurance advocate show in part because with todays current political discussion surrounding national health care they want to be informed by someone who knows the facts forward and backward not someone who is hoping to gain votes
8679440 at first the bearing isolator was so misunderstood by the industrial community it was considered to be a novelty today times have changed as plants know that the maintenance repair and operations of equipment used on the plant floor are vital areas that can be controlled and improved with our products
8679441 when i developed the first bearing isolator back in 1977 it was new and innovative it still is today though we have received over 40 related patents most are modifications or enhancements of the original the basic product remains the same with these innovations it is important we meet with our regional managers to further their skill and knowledge as these are the people that maintain global end user and distributor contact
8679442 inpro seal regional managers and distributors are located in every major city in north america add to that solid representation throughout south america the pacific rim and europe and you can see why the education process never stops aside from our regional manager sessions there are four formal workshops for our distributors at our facility and numerous regional workshops during the year in addition distributor personnel travel with the regional managers where they receive one on one training

8679446 saakashvili is accused of starting this war on the 7th
8679447 but that sounds like complete bs to me if what you say is true
8679448 virtually everyone believes georgian president mikheil saakashvili foolishly provoked a russian invasion on august 7 2008
8679449 it wouldnt be the first time that they deliberately timed their incursion in order to maximise its burial beneath other internationally important news stories thats for sure
8679450 it seems that golts would have corrected worms if needed
8679451 you should be trying this and this and stop doing that
8679452 i dont think harper has to be thinking about a majority at all
8679453 strategically this is sort of a prolonged war of attrition
8679454 you can fight a war with some objective less than total victory
8679455 what we have found is that the effects of preschool are long term and last through primary school
8679456 america is going to lose out in the long term if it doesnt adopt universal preschool education
8679457 it is one of the few highly developed countries that doesnt have close to universal preschool
8679458 i do not think there is unanimous appetite for it sanctioning russia
8679459 we were strongly in favour of territorial stability and integrity of georgia but after the last act of aggression and act of genocide and ethnic cleansing the south ossetian and abkhazian sides came to the conclusion that they can no longer live together with georgia in one state
8679460 the reality is such that sooner or later the international community will come to an understanding of the existence of these two independent states
8679461 the strategy is to create buffer zones empty territories from which people have been expelled all houses destroyed and fields burned so that it will be very difficult for people to return home even if security arrangements were made for that
8679462 now i can tell whether it is a haulage truck a bus or passenger vehicle with the same ease with which politicians and local leaders have let us down
8679463 promised grain deliveries never materialise week in and week out perhaps it is because the elections are over we dont know
8679464 due to their ngos inability to operate only 280 000 people of the 1 5 million in need of food assistance are being reached with distributions
8679465 we are starving and no one seems to care about our plight our livestock will soon perish
8679466 what we need is grain not affordable hampers containing luxuries like sugar cooking oil and toothpaste
8679467 we have survived on sadza a thick maize meal porridge as a staple who wants clean and healthy teeth when he is starving
8679468 they have to choose whether to barter their livestock to meet immediate needs in the form of grain or face the prospect of failing to prepare their fields for lack of draught power in time for the onset of the wet season
8679469 we applaud and are committed to efforts such as the child health campaign but we cannot forget that a growing number of children are suffering daily because of the ngo ban
8679470 every day that such an important lifeline of humanitarian aid for children remains cut off puts the children of this country at ever greater risk

8679546 in the long run i dont think that is going to be necessarily true i think consumers are going to start to switch away if prices become a larger factor
8679547 trading away to more affordable goods would be a reasonable option
8679548 there are a lot of consumers who are very insensitive and only want to buy organic or buy products that are deemed natural
8679549 that wont go away and that has always grown but there might be a substantial slow down away from that
8679550 sourcing organic food may become increasingly harder as well because the margins on organic isnt the same as other food the incentive for farmers is diminishing
8679551 organic categories that consumers find relevant and those that they find uninteresting and even frivolous
8679552 how do i go back seeing the world as it was

8679554 weve been making watches since pre history starting with movements carefully constructed with the bones of small mammals homo erectus preferred our watches to simply staring at the sky as it was more accurate and made them feel better than other foraging creatures our logo is based on the original cave paintings used to identify our skilled trade from those non skilled trades such as club making

8679558 a first in first served water allocation system is not appropriate
8679559 in southland the growing number of dairy conversions is putting pressure on councils ability to source domestic water supply now and into the future
8679560 theres some aquifers that are currently fully allocated allowing for no allocation to future water needs in communities such as lumsden
8679561 councillor jim copland made the comment that by the time it the policy comes along maybe the horse has bolted

8679564 we certainly wont be doing anything different during the week than we usually do
8679565 the message has come across loud and clear people want car makers to produce cleaner smarter cars that use less fuel reduce climate change emissions and slash fuel bills
8679566 politicians must act on public demand by standing up to the self interested lobbying of the car industry and delivering the tough standards that people clearly want
8679567 these survey results mirror what people have told us on the streets they are horrified by how much they have to spend on petrol and agree that they would be willing to pay more for a more fuel efficient car

8679582 over the last 2 years allergan has done a wonderful job educating the public about its botox cosmetic and juvederm filler products which is helping get people in the doors
8679583 many times physicians and medical spa owners think that all they need to do is put up a shingle saying they now offer botox and people will come running the truth is that there is much more profit in other aesthetic medicine procedures like physician strength chemical peels than with cosmetic injectables like botulinum toxin type a i e botox and dermal fillers i e juvederm restylane perlane radiesse
8679584 you need to look at entering the aesthetic field as a journey you are not going to learn everything you need to enter the industry in one weekend so you need to have access to accredited on going clinical training medical textbooks dvds and reputable on line resources in order to hone your skills just as you did in medical school
8679585 make your patients your priority make time for continuing education and keep an eye on your expenses
8679586 as you develop and grow your medical spa you are going to experience the same growing pains common to any new business the key is identifying or ideally anticipating them and responding with proven solutions the iapam through events such its the aesthetic medicine symposium which is held in scottsdale arizona strives to provide a forum where experts and peers can share industry innovations be educated on new and existing technologies and procedures and communicate about industry challenges and tested solutions
8679587 we know that families are looking for value both in the house plans that they choose and in the actual home they build
8679588 currently the trend is towards smaller home designs that include flexible and highly efficient floorplan layouts these type designs offer a multitude of benefits to the customer including minimizing wasted space in the floorplan providing for inexpensive future expansion options and allowing for varied use of certain areas of the home over time i e playroom to office to media room etc in addition to the obvious benefit of a lower overall cost to build
8679589 these homes were designed to provide flexible space layouts with plenty of room for inexpensive future expansion that may be needed as your family grows in size and in space requirements

8679591 gaining benefits requires solving a number of difficult scale out issues there is no one size fits all solution to database scale out you need to be able to flexibly combine and extend technologies to create workable solutions
8679592 for there to be increased adoption of open source databases at the enterprise application tier a number of factors need to be addressed
8679593 these include increased enterprise functionality improved service and support offering proof that performance fears are misplaced increased resistance traditional database software licensing and a move to web based architecture for internal applications
8679594 continuent tungsten is a very important database extension as it allows open source databases to support business critical solutions and provides a performance boost
8679595 tungsten enables customers to stay on oracle database without using costly enterprise licenses because tungsten can replicate from mysql to oracle and vice versa it opens new avenues for open source databases in the enterprise application mix
8679596 turning the tables the impact of open source on the enterprise database market
8679597 it is not enough to increase yield we must also increase the value of crops improve opportunities for farmers to access markets and increase income for rural businesses and entrepreneurs that support agriculture

8679601 youll see a bit of everything except minimalism because the work of the caribbean artist is marked by color and light usually reflecting their culture and identity
8679602 now is the moment for any art collector art connoisseur or art lover looking for the next big name to seriously pay attention to the caribbean region the art simply cannot be overlooked
8679603 we find it imperative to represent an important selection of cuban artists at the international caribbean art fair icafair gives us the opportunity to show some of the exquisite quality in modern and contemporary cuban art
8679604 the caribbean has often times been overlooked in the history of art cuban artists have been producing incredibly powerful work that broadly ranges in styles icafair gives the new york public a chance to view some magnificent visions of its neighboring countries
8679605 exposing people to caribbean art can motivate them to visit the islands it happened in the 40s when haitian art was introduced and acclaimed by the international art scene and it will happen again for the entire region
8679606 when caribbean art reaches the global market the artist benefits and indirectly supports and stimulates art related industries in the islands
8679607 abortion ends more black lives than heart disease cancer accidents aids and violent crime combined african americans constitute little more than 12 percent of the population but have more than a third 37 percent of abortions that rate has held relatively constant though in some regions the numbers are much starker in mississippi black women receive some 72 percent of all abortions according to the centers for disease control nationwide 512 out of every 1 000 black pregnancies end in an abortion revealingly enough roughly 80 percent of planned parenthoods abortion centers are in or near minority communities
8679608 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army

8679718 unless the state of texas violates their own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot

8679720 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable

8679724 pojavila se sumnja da je netko u sad u posebno stvorio ovaj sukob s ciljem da stanje u ini jo napetijim i stvori komparativnu prednost za jednog od kandidata koji se bori za mjesto predsjednika sad a
8679725 sugerirati da su sjedinjene dr ave to orkestrirale u ime politi kog kandidata ne zvu i razumno

8679731 the process we are conducting involves a number of alternatives including merger or acquisition of the company together with the possible sale of our c difficile and dna replication inhibition programs
8679732 while the process is ongoing we are encouraged by our progress to date
8679733 i would say we thought the company was worth 70 plus or minus

8679739 the internet will never take the place of the farmers market but it can help you find your way there
8679740 they stole 6 332 from me and then they had the legal muscle to get away with it
8679741 we have to assume the water was used because it went through the meter and we have no evidence that it was defective
8679742 he thought i should be able to make the problem go away
8679743 if i had a leak in my house i would repair it instantaneously
8679744 i think its intentional the ordinance is written that way to avoid any potential for giving away public services
8679745 this has siphoned off a tremendous amount of my energy a fair amount of my money and it has been unpleasant
8679746 indeed there doesnt seem to be a ready explanation for where the water could have gone
8679747 it has been a very long process a very detailed process
8679748 its open season on islam muslims are the new jews
8679749 in the way that it was and still is in some parts almost legitimate to target jews many muslims would say we feel the exact same way that somehow there is a message out there that it is ok to target people as long as they are muslims
8679750 in addition to being merely descriptive the applied for mark appears to be generic in connection with the identified services and therefore incapable of functioning as a source identifier for applicants services
8679751 no final determination as to the registrability of the mark has been made
8679752 while we have a more favorable view on dells revenue outlook for the second half of 2008 we remain concerned that dell remains aggressive on pricing as the company attempts to penetrate major channel distributors and manage the companys spiraling number of product skus
8679753 pricing remains a wildcard given dells burgeoning retail business and the strong growth of lower cost notebooks
8679754 well advertised push into the retail channel appears to us to have proceeded well driving worldwide pc unit market share up
8679755 while we have a more favorable view on dells revenue outlook for the second half of 2008 we remain concerned that dell remains aggressive on pricing as the company attempts to penetrate major channel distributors and manage the companys spiraling number of product skus
8679756 pricing remains a wildcard given dells burgeoning retail business and the strong growth of lower cost notebooks
8679757 the knowledge worker and the ad hoc use of paper
8679758 netapp has a commanding presence in the nas network attached storage space which would be attractrive to any enterprise hardware company
8679759 however given timing and finances we believe there is only one possibility as a candidate ibm
8679760 our estimates reflect an 18 1 gross margin down 187 bps year over year due to aggressive pricing commodity pricing returning to normalized levels and increased sales through retail channels
8679761 coverage of the u s economy at 7 percent during the previous six weeks was down by more than half to 3 percent during these two weeks stories about gas and oil prices which had been at 5 percent were also down by more than half to 2 percent coverage of the iraq war also dipped slightly going from 4 percent in the previous six weeks to 3 percent during the two weeks examined around the olympics
8679762 together during the 10 weekdays of nbc news programming studied the two shows devoted almost half 48 percent of the airtime to stories about the games or china that is more than three times as much coverage as the media overall
8679763 consider the night of august 11 the first tuesday of the games that evening nbc nightly news ran six stories on the olympics and china 69 percent of their news coverage that included a brief tour of tiananmen square by host brian williams and an update on the gold medal winning exploits of u s swimmer michael phelps in comparison that same night cbs evening news ran no stories on either forgoing even a recap of the days results abcs world news tonight offered a profile of michael phelps and how many in china are becoming his fans
8679764 stories about the opening ceremonies and chinese preparations for the games both made up 18 percent chinas political system made up just 2 percent the political issue that did get sizable attention the week prior was human rights 13 percent though there was no coverage of the issue once the games began
8679765 in all my decades at the post this is the first event ive covered at which i was certain that the main point of the exercise was to co opt the western media including nbc with a splendidly pretty sparsely attended completely controlled sports event inside a quasi military compound we had little alternative but to be a conduit for happy olympics progressive china propaganda i suspect it worked
8679766 the story of the dubbed singing voice was often portrayed as an illustration of official chinese manipulation and control a kind of proxy for stories about government authority
8679767 historic mission to enforce the nations civil rights laws without regard to politics to pursuing an agenda which placed the highest priority on the partisan political goals of the political appointees who supervised the section
8679768 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8679769 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8679770 if my guesses are confirmed then the suspicion is raised that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8679771 i think that those claims first and foremost are patently false but it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8679772 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8679773 u s citizens were indeed in the area in conflict
8679774 they were acting in implementing those orders doing as they were ordered and the only one who can give such orders is their leader
8679775 what were supposed to let ourselves be killed and for that they will say leave us in the g 8 and who will remain in the g 8 when were all killed
8679776 the new look and feel of pathway studio was designed based on feedback from biologists to make pathway modeling during experimental data analysis a routine process and an exciting experience

8679779 home buyers want a real estate professional who understands the market and provides them with objective guidance
8679780 they want an agent who knows something not just one who sells something the best agents and brokers are able to separate the facts from the hype and clarify how national real estate news affects local markets

8679813 snap on is very committed to supporting the backbone of tomorrows workforce and the s tech site provides a unique opportunity to support and encourage tech students by giving them a way to connect with each other and with professionals in the field
8679814 raceway media brought valuable experience to the project with their background in developing vertical niche social networking sites with the launch of s tech todays tech students and technicians can now enjoy their very own online community
8679815 we placed a statement on the s tech homepage that really captures the essence of what we wanted the site to be for its users your site your network your future
8679816 our goal was to create a social network and destination website that would speak directly to this particular community and where they could create connections with other people who share their experiences interests and goals
8679817 few managers or executives formally document a plan of their communication events
8679818 they dont have the time needed to create a proper plan from scratch
8679819 so the process of planning a communication event in an organization is now much easier than before using these practical comprehensive document templates
8679820 it was surprising that almost every company we spoke to have the same communication process
8679821 they identify who they want to communicate formally with they then decide on the message and the method and finally they try and get feedback on the effectiveness of the communication undertaken so we created a communication plan template to help them to plan this process more efficiently the template helps a business to set out all of the communications events that they will undertake over a specified period of time it then helps them to plan each event to make sure that the right information is given to the right people at the right time its perfect for projects departments and organizations that take their communications seriously

8679850 animal studies have indicated for years that msg might be associated with weight gain
8679851 ours is the first study to show a link between msg use and weight in humans
8679852 second human studies where msg was added to the diet have failed to show changes in body weight and third a recently published rat study suggests that msg in the diet actually suppresses body weight
8679853 we found that prevalence of overweight was significantly higher in msg users than in non users
8679854 we saw this risk even when we controlled for physical activity total calorie intake and other possible explanations for the difference in body mass the positive associations between msg intake and overweight were consistent with data from animal studies
8679855 in the he et al study the average bmi among non msg users versus the highest quartile of estimated msg use was 22 3 versus 23 5 given this small difference the imprecise methods by which msg intake was estimated and controlled human studies that directly conflict with the results of this report the glutamate association statement strongly questions the broad extrapolation made by the authors
8679856 numerous regulatory authorities and expert bodies including fao who fda health canada efsa and fsanz all have concluded that msg is safe for use as an ingredient in foods

8679858 we flew from linton to kinloss in scotland and then onto norway at 4000 feet before descending to 400 feet over our final fix point at saltoya island
8679859 the tirpitz had been photographed by the norwegian resistance so we knew where it was but to have any chance of success we needed to fly at 150 feet above the water
8679860 those missions were flown in darkness with just moonlight to guide us it was dangerous enough on a clear night so a weather forecast was crucial afterwards all that was left was to pray to god
8679861 by making saltoya island at a known time we were able to find our way to the target on the second run we released four bombs
8679862 the idea was to drop them onto the side of the fjord where they would roll into the water descend and then rise again to explode at 30 feet hopefully under the hull
8679863 it seemed every gun in norway was directed at us we were a sitting target and were shot down even before we reached the tirpitz the aircraft was a fireball it banked and then headed for a frozen lake we skidded across it into some trees
8679864 a farming family rescued us and i remember two little girls helped remove our flying helmets which they later hid in a wood
8679865 to me they were true war heroes how they kept that nights events a secret is incredible the temptation to tell their friends must have been overwhelming but they told nobody and that gave us the chance to escape
8679866 that gave us a head start the family gave my navigator reg williams and me a coat each and we headed off for sweden but the terrain was mountainous and the snow three feet deep we sheltered by day and travelled by night
8679867 we were within 3km of the border when we decided to rest up unfortunately we heard some workmen who had spotted our footprints and within a quarter of an hour they returned with german guards it sounds like a music hall joke but they really did say for you the war is over
8679868 i knocked on a door and the lady who answered knew the story i was taken to the farm where we crashed and met by torbjorn hellan the grandson of the girl who cared for us he said come with me ive got something for you we went into his barn and there on the wall was my helmet
8679869 the girls had recovered it from the wood and torbjorns family had kept it in the hope that one day i would return to collect it
8679870 ever since the crash i have worried about what happened to that family and it seems they in turn had been concerned as to my fate meeting them was like completing the circle an end to the story

8679882 the advocacy center will utilize the information from strengthening the multi disciplinary team members
8679883 we looked at three local sites taking some of what we had learned from the case studies to develop kind of a generic study
8679884 we looked at a study that holds 4 000 people with 3 000 on the home side and 1 000 on the visitors side
8679885 the conceptual layout at this point uses the existing stadium location
8679886 we did look at what it would take to place a new stadium up to the north and abandon this
8679887 this centers it on the field and has an eight lane track
8679888 we feel there is a strong case not to build out the required parking and use street parking as it is used now
8679889 what were looking at is the 900 and some parking spaces
8679890 but until we televise it were concerned about the carrying capacity
8679891 by the time we expand the stadium and accommodate for the parking these house lots are crucial
8679892 so right off the bat to be comfortable in this site were at almost 1 5 million in property acquisition
8679893 the fact that we already own this isnt necessarily an advantage
8679894 some of the challenges and opportunities are the floodway through here and wetlands associated with that in the middle of the golf course
8679895 the stadium committee has been in contact with the legion
8679896 one of the opportunities that we could have with this piece of property is going with zoning variance and sharing with the college on heavy traffic days
8679897 other opportunities on this site as you can see we dont use it all we preserve the wetlands and have space for parkland and greenlands
8679898 there is a floodway through the site and also a flood plain but right now were outside those limits we are trying everything possible to stay out of the wetlands
8679899 it is a great opportunity for green space on the west side of town
8679900 one of the struggles with this piece of property is that it is primarily almost all in the flood plain
8679901 besides being in the flood plain and no utilities this is the perfect site
8679902 traffic is probably a positive because were able to get them out of here quick
8679903 weve captured the cost for each site to get them shovel ready
8679904 weve talked a little bit about some of the site acquisition costs on what is known the next step is to more finally design what is in the stadium project proper
8679905 we dont talk about celebrations we just notice them nobody in particular the whole team you know
8679906 we dont talk about celebrations we just notice them translation boy how i wish i was jose reyes he is young fast strong and not hated by his own teams fans nobody in particular the whole team you know

8679913 i am more than impressed by the depth and breadth of knowledge displayed by the team at 49above marketing they went the extra mile to deliver a personalized package tailored specifically to the needs of our site
8679914 after reviewing several online businesses and performing countless hours of research on which online business to choose i was still feeling skeptical
8679915 i accepted and thank the heavens that i did i have been enrolled for a little over 3 months and my business is 100 profitable the major difference for me is six figures commitment to their students success coaching and guiding me all the way
8679916 this business is truly a god send in my life and i owe it all to mr nielson and six figure consulting for giving me a chance to change my life

8679938 kay hagan is trying to run a campaign in north carolina that casts her as a moderate but the money thats paying for it is coming from the left wing fringe of political thought
8679939 you can tell a lot about a person by their friends and these are friends most north carolinians would not be comfortable having over for dinner
8679940 kay hagan does not represent the values of this state she is a trojan horse for a long list of wacky left wing outside groups bent on policies that would horrify most north carolinians if they knew about it

8679944 i am sure i will be totally a hundred percent criticized
8679945 but im criticized anyways regardless whether its making music or acting theres always people who love what people do and theres always detractors and i think you just have to get to the point where you stop caring what other people think i know that summer is the same that we judge our own performances pretty stridently and were harsh on ourselves i think thats how you have to live life is listening to yourself and listening to your own judgments and try to self regulate it and just try and keep doing a good job
8679946 we want you to work together and share your knowledge
8679947 may acquire the same information and engage in the same transactions as are available to sighted guests with substantially equivalent ease of us

8679957 n o s n o ajudou a levar seguran a
8679958 well the rules havent changed a lot but theres a lot more scrutiny over whether the rules are being met
8679959 they are looking at making the rules stricter like setting standards for inspecting certain bridges a lot more often
8679960 even if the damage from the approaching storm is fractional it could still be significant
8679961 sparse capacity means that every lost to the marketplace will be felt particularly as the northern hemispheres winter is just around the corner
8679962 as long as there is a chance that well be in this storm ill be here in louisiana
8679963 regardless of its predicted path it is important for citizens in the to listen to what their local officials are advising over the course of the next few days and to take these simple steps to prepare
8679964 its always very special because im very close to my house
8679965 we arrive in good shape having demonstrated our speed in the last races
8679966 the target is to try to continue with this level in the next races
8679967 it was very disappointing i remember it as one of the most difficult periods of my career
8679968 it is in our view an important step forward to understanding the properties of the
8679969 dark matter makes up five times more matter in the universe than ordinary matter this study confirms that we are dealing with a very different kind of matter unlike anything that we are made of
8679970 and were able to study it in a very powerful collision of two clusters of galaxies
8679971 we have six races to go and these are the ones we have to look at now
8679972 it has been a disappointing couple of races mainly the last one
8679973 its given valentino a huge gap in the championship and its just time for us to keep our heads down and try to do the best we can in these last races we have nothing more to do other than this
8679974 i think chasing a championship down with this points gap is maybe possible with other riders but with valentino is nearly impossible
8679975 we have to do the best job we can we found some positive points in the brno test we have a little more confidence with the bike and hopefully we wont make a mistake like last week
8679976 but considering weve done 30 races with ducati and this was my first crash in a race so i think its acceptable
8679977 despite this good news in cambodia the area still remains at risk from conversion to agro industrial plantations for crops including biofuels and commercial mining
8679978 we knew before the start in brno that it was very difficult but i tried to do the maximum and my target was to finish as the first michelin rider
8679979 anyway michelin worked 100 and we are a little bit more confident here than in brno
8679980 for sure when i complete this race ill have the record but i dont really care about records
8679981 for sure im not stopping at the moment so maybe i can increase it a lot
8679982 maybe i want to ride for nine or ten years more
8679983 i still enjoy riding the bike and i get good adrenaline i really like it
8679984 we were happy to be back on the podium at brno after a long time
8679985 i think the whole suzuki staff is working really hard and we had a good test we tested a new chassis and new parts on the bike and we improved a little bit
8679986 we have to continue to work but we decided to try to use the new bike here in misano i see a big effort from suzuki to try to develop the bike
8679987 the executive and the legislative branches of the federal government
