9220013 strong science and technology backgrounds and unquestioned reputations for integrity and objectivity
9220014 my administration will work to guarantee to students access to strong science curriculum at all grade levels so they graduate knowing how science works emphasis added using hands on it enhanced education
9220015 support research to understand the strategies and mechanisms that bring lasting improvements to stem education and ensure that promising practices are widely shared
9220016 and provide a mechanism for sharing the latest innovations and practices in stem education with educators
9220017 i will implement the recommendations of the defense science board on defense manufacturing
9220018 ensuring that the u s continues to lead the world in science and technology will be a central priority for my administration but we face unprecedented challenges that demand new approaches for example the u s annually imports 53 billion more in advanced technology products than we export china is now the worlds number one high technology exporter this competitive situation may only worsen over time because the number of u s students pursuing technical careers is declining the u s ranks 17th among developed nations in the proportion of college students receiving degrees in science or engineering we were in third place 30 years ago my administration will increase funding for basic research in physical and life sciences mathematics and engineering at a rate that would double basic research budgets over the next decade we will increase research grants for early career researchers to keep young scientists entering these fields we will increase support for high risk high payoff research portfolios at our science agencies and we will invest in the breakthrough research we need to meet our energy challenges and to transform our defense programs
9220019 first the u s must get off the sidelines and take long overdue action to reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions we must also take a leadership role in designing technologies that allow us to enjoy a growing prosperous economy while reducing greenhouse gas emissions with the right incentives im convinced that american ingenuity can do this and in the process make american businesses more productive create jobs and make americas buildings and vehicles safer and more attractive
9220020 by the amount scientists say is necessary 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 i will start reducing emissions immediately by establishing strong annual reduction targets with an intermediate goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 i will require all pollution credits to be auctioned
9220021 i have proposed programs that taken together will increase federal investment in the clean energy research development and deployment to 150 billion over 10 years
9220022 i will also work closely with utilities to introduce a digital smart grid
9220023 all american citizens need high quality science technology engineering and mathematics stem education that inspires them to know more about the world around them engages them in exploring challenging questions and involves them in high quality intellectual work stem education is no longer only for those pursuing stem careers it should enable all citizens to solve problems collaborate weigh evidence and communicate ideas i will work to ensure that all americans including those in traditionally underrepresented groups have the knowledge and skills they need to engage in society innovate in our world and compete in the global economy
9220024 when sputnik was launched in 1957 president eisenhower used the event as a call to arms for americans to help secure our country and to increase the number of students studying math and science
9220025 put basic defense research on a path to double and will assure strong funding for investments in dods applied research programs
9220026 overseas i will launch a shared security partnership that invests 5 billion over three years to forge an international intelligence and law enforcement infrastructure to take down terrorist networks i will also strengthen u s intelligence collection overseas to identify and interdict would be bio terrorists before they strike and expand the u s governments bioforensics program for tracking the source of any biological weapon i will work to make any use of disease as a weapon declared globally a crime against humanity and to ensure our country is prepared should such an event occur we must provide our public health system across the country with the surge capacity to confront a crisis and improve our ability to cope with infectious diseases i will invest in new vaccines and technology to detect attacks and their origin so that we can react in a timely fashion
9220027 advances in the genetic engineering of plants have provided enormous benefits to american farmers i believe that we can continue to modify plants safely with new genetic methods abetted by stringent tests for environmental and health effects and by stronger regulatory oversight guided by the best available scientific advice disease treatment and identification is likewise being transformed by modern genetics recombinant dna rdna technology has produced a number of products such as human growth hormone or insulin or other complicated proteins involved in bone metabolism immune response and tissue repair the promise of rdna is its ability to sidestep potentially harmful intermediaries that could have a pathogenic effect t he nih established the recombinant dna advisory committee which now provides advice and guidance on human gene therapy as well as other ethical concerns or potential abuse of rdna technology until we are equipped to ascertain the safety of such methods i will continue to support the activities and recommendations of the recombinant dna advisory committee
9220028 i strongly support expanding research on stem cells i believe that the restrictions that president bush has placed on funding of human embryonic stem cell research have handcuffed our scientists and hindered our ability to compete with other nations as president i will lift the current
9220029 protection of the oceans is one of the many reasons i have developed an ambitious plan to reduce u s emissions of greenhouse gases we need to enhance our understanding of the effect of climate change on oceans and the effect of acidification on marine life through expanded research programs at nasa the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the national science foundation nsf and the u s geological survey usgs i will propel the u s into a leadership position in marine steward ship and climate change research
9220030 i will work actively to ensure that the u s ratifies the law of the sea convention an agreement supported by more than 150 countries that will protect our economic and security interests while providing an important international collaboration to protect the oceans and its resources
9220031 first prices and policies must be set in a ways that give everyone a clear incentive to use water efficiently and avoid waste
9220032 nasa not only will inspire the world with both human and robotic space exploration but also will again lead in confronting the challenges we face here on earth including global climate change energy independence and aeronautics research in achieving this vision i will reach out to include international partners and to engage the private sector to amplify nasas reach
9220033 t he council was briefly revived from 1989 to 1992
9220034 i believe such information must be expert and uncolored by ideology i will restore the basic principle that government decisions should be based on the best available scientifically valid evidence and not on the ideological predispositions of agency officials or political appointtees more broadly i am committed to creating a transparent and connected democracy using cutting edge technologies to provide a new level of transparency accountability and participation for americas citizens policies must be determined using a process that builds on the long tradition of open debate that has characterized progress in science including review by individuals who might bring new information or contrasting views
9220035 c ontinued investment in fundamental research is essential for ensuring healthier lives better sources of energy superior military capacity and high wage jobs for our nations future yet today we are clearly under investing in research across the spectrum of scientific and engineering disciplines as a result our science agencies are often able to support no more than one in ten proposals that they receive arresting the careers of our young scientists and blocking our ability to pursue many remarkable recent advances i n this environment scientists are less likely to pursue the risky research that may lead to the most important breakthroughs as president i will increase funding at a rate that would double basic research budgets in 10 years

9220289 i guess whats evident is how much it took us to lift the mandela silverware so weve achieved something and weve got the opportunity to go on and achieve more so well hang on to that
9220290 weve got the opportunity now to regroup and get back and focus on what is a fantastic opportunity in brisbane
9220291 the last week has been all about demonstrating a couple of things
9220292 first that the liberal national parties are utterly united and capable of working together on a complex issue like this also that the coalition is in strong shape able to make a decision and stick with it that hasnt always been the case it is an important message to send to the electorate
9220293 the business community is but one of the factors the liberal party needs to take into account when it makes decisions
9220294 you only get one chance to sell a state asset and you have to meet some key tests you dont sell out consumers and you dont sell out taxpayers in the current climate we wouldnt have got an adequate return we listen to business we listen to other parts of the community
9220295 the single biggest act of economic vandalism ever witnessed in this state
9220296 less than subtle application for a job in the private sector
9220297 the fact is that michael costa finally qualifies for his parliamentary superannuation next month
9220298 so this is the future of the republican party you are looking at a future in which national security has bumped down the list of priorities behind abortion politics gender politics and energy politics
9220299 ms palin is a bold pick and probably a shrewd one its not nearly so clear that she is a responsible pick or a wise one
9220300 her executive experience consists of less than two years as governor of her sparsely populated state plus six years as mayor of wasilla pop 8 471

9220303 they arsenal are an excellent side and they played very very well today
9220304 i just said to my players we need the kind of breaks they got to get something here today we needed the penalty which basically was a load of nonsense
9220305 im not denying it hit his arm but when youre two and a half yards away and someone hits the ball its very difficult to get out of the way i think its harsh
9220306 they played very well to take nothing away from them we came up against a side that were on their game and had a key player back in cesc fabregas who is a wonderful player
9220307 theyll be there or thereabouts again this year itll come down to which team beats which team at the top the same four teams are going to be there again theres no doubt about that
9220308 i think one of the problems weve had this year has been that we have been hit by a lot of injuries
9220309 seb is awaiting x rays but the doctor at chester hospital and seb are sure its a broken femur
9220310 he is very tough and is putting on a brave face on it but its a major blow

9220315 she says id rather you talk on the phone to your children than for them to have no father
9220316 the last week has been all about demonstrating a couple of things
9220317 first that the liberal national parties are utterly united and capable of working together on a complex issue like this also that the coalition is in strong shape able to make a decision and stick with it that hasnt always been the case it is an important message to send to the electorate
9220318 the business community is but one of the factors the liberal party needs to take into account when it makes decisions
9220319 you only get one chance to sell a state asset and you have to meet some key tests you dont sell out consumers and you dont sell out taxpayers in the current climate we wouldnt have got an adequate return we listen to business we listen to other parts of the community
9220320 the single biggest act of economic vandalism ever witnessed in this state
9220321 less than subtle application for a job in the private sector
9220322 so this is the future of the republican party you are looking at a future in which national security has bumped down the list of priorities behind abortion politics gender politics and energy politics
9220323 ms palin is a bold pick and probably a shrewd one its not nearly so clear that she is a responsible pick or a wise one

9220325 the current lockout trial will cease at the start of september
9220326 an evaluation of its effectiveness will be completed the temporary lockout will cease before any future ongoing arrangements are put in place
9220327 this is the problem with the 2am lockout we will never know if the concept could have worked because premier john brumby completely botched the implementation of the trial
9220328 the springboks got into the game they built momentum and we dropped off it and thats what happens at this level
9220329 the springboks are world champions someone has to be bottom of the table it doesnt mean youre not a good side
9220330 weve already seen in this tournament how little it takes to go from being a victor and enjoying the experience to a loser and not enjoying the experience
9220331 i guess whats evident is how much it took us to lift the mandela silverware so weve achieved something and weve got the opportunity to go on and achieve more so well hang on to that
9220332 weve got the opportunity now to regroup and get back and focus on what is a fantastic opportunity in brisbane
9220333 large scale evacuation will continue till all the marooned people are rescued in the next three to four days
9220334 we will have to provide food and shelter to the survivors until october as they will not be able to return home
9220335 essential commodities including food are now being transported by boat
9220336 more army personnel and medical teams have been sent to the affected districts with tents rubber sheets medicines and water purification tablets
9220337 we have been stuck here for the past 10 days with no rescue team reaching here our food and water stocks have run out our mobiles are working but they too will fail any moment
9220338 we have absolutely nothing with us here we left everything behind

9220355 the hope of the macarthur foundation upon entering second life is to be of service in helping people come together and empowering them to do the things they want to do
9220356 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
9220357 can you imagine this is what she sees every day
9220358 often people go to the museums and then to the red light district
9220359 people think just because the windows are transparent that the place is transparent
9220360 but there is still a lot of abuse and trafficking of women
9220361 there is no labor shortage you just have to pay enough
9220362 coming to america getting visas to do business in silicon valley
9220363 the visa application process is expensive very time consuming and very energy consuming
9220364 there is less racism classism sexism or general prejudice here than anywhere else ive been
9220365 but new orleanians are very resilient very tough and well get through this
9220366 if we have anything it will be street flooding and hopefully not that bad
9220367 there is no reason for anyone in the city of new orleans to ride out this storm
9220368 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9220369 we dont want folks worrying about their property it is time for people to be worried about their personal safety
9220370 there is no question we are taking this storm seriously
9220371 i am absolutely sure that the city and state is much better prepared than they were before
9220372 people themselves are also better prepared because theyve gone through it
9220373 from a city standpoint were significantly head of the game as far as planning
9220374 things werent really as bad as they could have been
9220375 today it has become purely voluntary to pay for music
9220376 if i tell you to go listen to this band you could pay or you might not its pretty much up to you so the music business has become a big tip jar
9220377 were still clinging to the vine of music as a product
9220378 but were swinging toward the vine of music as a service we need to get ready to let go and grab the next vine which is a pool of money and a fair way to split it up rather than controlling the quantity and destiny of sound recordings
9220379 i dont think we should be suing students and i dont think we should be suing people in their homes
9220380 ongoing effort to explore new business models in the music industry
9220381 even if you pay a flat fee for it at the moment you use it there are no financial considerations its already been paid for
9220382 its too late to charge people for what theyre already getting for free
9220383 this is just taxation of a basic universal service that already exists for the benefit a distant power that actively harasses the people being taxed without offering them any meaningful representation
9220384 while i would gladly take the credit blanket licensing has over 150 years of history behind it
9220385 collective licensing is what people do when they lose control or when control is no longer practical or efficient
9220386 a pool of money and a fair way to split it up replaces control
9220387 clearly 5 per month would be an insane number in china or india if you could get a nickel a month you could grow the business tenfold in those countries in another country that had a high g d p a nickel per month would be ridiculously cheap so you negotiate fair is whatever you agree upon
9220388 were building a as yet unnamed company inside warner that is not intended to be solely owned by warner
9220389 we hope all of the rights holders will come in and take ownership with us and warner will not control it our goal is to create a collective society for the digital age
9220390 but its a tax nonetheless itll be a government approved cartel that collects money from virtually everyone often without their knowledge and failure to pay their tax will ultimately result in people with guns coming to your door
9220391 jims proposal does nothing but direct money to the very people that tried to prevent this future from coming to be
9220392 while further legitimizing the terror being waged in the courtrooms against their members
9220393 i understand what david is thinking but i assure you we have no such interest in government running this or having any part of it
9220394 but more important than the risk for an i s p is the marketing
9220395 i s p s want to distinguish themselves with marketing
9220396 you can only imagine that an i s p that marketed a fair trade network connection would see a marketing advantage
9220397 people should not be too harsh on jim for trying to get the ball rolling
9220398 at this point 96 percent of the population is guilty of some sort of infringement whether theyre streaming or downloading or sharing
9220399 grand theft childhood the surprising truth about violent video games and what parents can do
9220400 probably worry too much about the wrong things and too little about more subtle issues and complex effects that are much more likely to affect our children
9220401 children are drawn to violent themes because listening to and playing with those frightening images helps them safely master the experience of being frightened this is an important skill perhaps even a life saving one
9220402 video games give free rein to fantasies of power glory and freedom thats quite different from the mundane lives of most children
9220403 children are drawn to violent themes because listening to and playing with those frightening images helps them safely master the experience of being frightened this is an important skill perhaps even a life saving one

9220405 will seek a stronger voice for its management team in microsofts talks to acquire yahoo
9220406 i think that definitely the wimbledon win helped me a lot to change my mentality to realize not every thing has to be perfect all the time
9220407 thats helped me to if i dont have a perfect practice i dont get really upset about the whole tournament
9220408 if i can get my racket on the ball its not too bad
9220409 im a tall guy as well its up near my shoulders where other guys its toward their head against a guy like him theres a sense of urgency to every point especially when hes serving
9220410 it was tough but id like to think now that im wiser im ready to listen to my coach
9220411 heart rate galvanic skin response emg brain signals respiration rate body temperature movement facial movements facial expressions and blood pressure
9220412 taking the idea of monitoring people at work to a new level
9220413 this system involves intrusion into every single aspect of the lives of the employees it raises very serious privacy issues
9220414 this system takes the idea of monitoring people at work to a new level with a new level of invasiveness but in a very old fashioned way because it monitors what is going in rather than the results
9220415 imposing this level of intrusion on employees could only be justified in exceptional circumstances
9220416 if the system picked up an increase in heart rate or facial expressions suggestive of stress or frustration it would tell management that he needed help
9220417 yeah everybody talks tough but how many of you submitted to a drug test to get the job you have now
9220418 how can i carry on daddy it will only lead to my freedom being taken away i will become a machine like everything else you find in offices if they know how i feel all the time they will be able to manipulate me all the time can i be a landscape artist instead pleeeease

9220425 take your sensors and shove them where the sun dont shine
9220426 if some employer wanted to do this to me id quit
9220427 look at all the cool things you can do with them
9220428 the system could also automatically detect frustration or stress in the user and offer and provide assistance accordingly
9220429 god is reminding us on the anniversary of katrina that he can send mother nature back
9220430 i want to put everyone on alert that this storm is a very serious matter
9220431 what youre going to see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising at all levels of government starting with the local and the state level and leading up to the federal level
9220432 its not the wind or the water im worried about
9220433 the police couldnt protect anybody the last time and i have no confidence things will be any different now
9220434 the stress is obviously compounded by the fact that there is now the threat of a major hurricane again
9220435 people are worrying what will happen to their homes they have worked so hard to rebuild people are tired theyve been through so much
9220436 a lot of people are saying shame on hasbro shame on mattel if you wouldnt be so short sighted about this then you have an opportunity to actually make some money from this rather than alienate your existing customers
9220437 perhaps sit down together and say look these guys have created this fantastic piece of software that lots of people use why not employ them or have a similar product on there that is licensed but use that to advertise your other products
9220438 the main feature with scrabulous for me is that i can play it in facebook i dont have to go to an external site and then search for all my friends all over again because i dont think that would work and i dont think many people would sign up for it

9220466 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
9220467 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
9220468 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
9220469 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
9220470 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
9220471 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
9220472 dont expect much honesty transparency or accountability from climate armageddonites
9220473 observed climate change and the negligible global effect of greenhouse gas emission limits in the state of colorado
9220474 the system of modern capitalism will generate ever larger environmental consequences outstripping efforts to manage them
9220475 it is unimaginable that american politics as we know it will deliver the transformative changes needed
9220476 it really has nothing to do with his stand on global warming
9220477 hes a great faculty member hes an institution at csu
9220478 were corrupting more and more people to care about this stuff
9220479 this is one emergency that we cant drill our way out of
9220480 wont even follow bin laden to the cave where he lives
9220481 for many americans the exciting young candidate who won the iowa caucuses had the promise of being a new kind of politician entirely better than and different from the political norm of bitterness and calculation
9220482 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9220483 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9220484 ms palin has made it clear through her actions that she is unwilling to do even as much as the bush administration to address the impacts of global warming
9220485 unfortunately with her support for drilling in the arctic refuge and off our coasts governor palin will simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil
9220486 in fact there is insufficient evidence that polar bears are in danger of becoming extinct within the foreseeable future the possible listing of a healthy species like the polar bear would be based on uncertain modeling of possible effects the center for biological diversity which petitioned for the polar bear to be protected wants the listing to force the government to either stop or severely limit any public or private action that produces or even allows the production of greenhouse gases such limits should be adopted through an open process in which environmental issues are weighed against economic and social needs and where scientists debate and present information that policy makers need to make the best decisions americans should become involved in the issue of climate change by offering suggestions for constructive action to their state governments but listing the polar bear as threatened is the wrong way to get to the right answer
9220487 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
9220488 completely ridiculous and a waste of the courts time this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear
9220489 conserving energy and using it more efficiently doesnt necessarily mean you have to sacrifice your quality of life
9220490 its the little things like making sure lights computers and appliances are turned off and slowing down on the road which will save money spent on gasoline
9220491 ignoring the problem reflects a liberal live for today attitude unworthy of our great country
9220492 in a stadium like this it felt like one living organism
9220493 people are really going to see which venue looks more like america and its this one
9220494 he thoroughly and compellingly explained his plan for change with specific distinctions between what government should be responsible for and personal responsibility
9220495 we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
9220496 i cant imagine why youd have a hard time making up your mind
9220497 its important to understand how our democracy works not just looking on television but to participate is important to me
9220498 i believe we wouldnt be in iraq in his administration mcnally said
9220499 i think you get the handlers in there and you just get lost
9220500 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
9220501 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
9220502 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
9220503 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
9220504 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
9220505 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
9220506 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
9220507 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
9220508 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
9220509 non voleva cedere al flusso di ricordi ed emozioni forse provava un senso di lealt verso la propria storia una cosa accennare a unesperienza usarla come riferimento e analogia ma descrivere il fatto orrendo nei dettagli a estranei che annuiranno e dimenticheranno doveva sembrargli un tradimento del proprio dolore
9220510 non voleva cedere al flusso di ricordi ed emozioni forse provava un senso di lealt verso la propria storia una cosa accennare a unesperienza usarla come riferimento e analogia ma descrivere il fatto orrendo nei dettagli a estranei che annuiranno e dimenticheranno doveva sembrargli un tradimento del proprio dolore
9220511 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9220512 she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9220513 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade
9220514 the last thing women need is a president and vice president who are prepared to turn back the clock on womens rights and repeal the protections of roe v wade
9220515 when as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president and john mccain promises to appoint more scalias and thomases and end a womans right to choose it is time for a change
9220516 in an era when over 80 percent of downs syndrome babies are aborted the palins feel they have been extremely blessed by god to raise an absolutely perfect son
9220517 gov palin continues to use her testimony to advance protections for unborn children
9220518 will i get a nominee who will keep his word to me in the vetting process if any word is actually given
9220519 we all know that dance nobody actually admits they ask the roe question and the question doesnt get asked and it doesnt get answered and therefore the nominees get on the bench and they do what they want
9220520 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
9220521 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
9220522 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
9220523 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9220524 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
9220525 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
9220526 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
9220527 as a follow up to my below post picking a female vp makes it very difficult for obama to execute the second part of his strategy painting mccain as the same as bush
9220528 maybe they wont notice that i am taking john mccains straight talk express campaign themes
9220529 i dont think so america knows mccain just sold out the country for a politic tactical stunt the woman has no experience on diversity of economics no national experience with any issue if the 72 year old kicks the bucket so would we as a country this woman is soooooo under qualified
9220530 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses
9220531 we are facing a planetary emergency which is not like anything we have experienced in the history of humankind
9220532 the solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon based fossil fuels
9220533 we need to invest in innovation i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out to tackle that
9220534 now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning mandatory caps on planet warming carbon
9220535 the carbon based industries have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for all its worth
9220536 taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
9220537 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving the climate crisis
9220538 the release of carbon dioxide is massive in this country
9220539 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
9220540 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9220541 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9220542 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9220543 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
9220544 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9220545 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9220546 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9220547 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9220548 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
9220549 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9220550 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9220551 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
9220552 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
9220553 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
9220554 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
9220555 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
9220556 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
9220557 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
9220558 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
9220559 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
9220560 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
9220561 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
9220562 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
9220563 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
9220564 space based solar power as an opportunity for strategic security
9220565 the lunar infrastructure as proposed by the late gerard k oneill is well thought out
9220566 lastly i wanted to say that these figures are based on current residential demand
9220567 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
9220568 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
9220569 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
9220570 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
9220571 we must seize this opportunity to elect united states of america
9220572 if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis
9220573 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9220574 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of mankind
9220575 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
9220576 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
9220577 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
9220578 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
9220579 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
9220580 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
9220581 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks
9220582 weve been a band for 10 years and this is probably the coolest thing weve ever done
9220583 if god doesnt live in colorado at least thats where he spends most of his time
9220584 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
9220585 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
9220586 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
9220587 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
9220588 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
9220589 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
9220590 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
9220591 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
9220592 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
9220593 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
9220594 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
9220595 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
9220596 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
9220597 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
9220598 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
9220599 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
9220600 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
9220601 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
9220602 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
9220603 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
9220604 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
9220605 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
9220606 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
9220607 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
9220608 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
9220609 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
9220610 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
9220611 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
9220612 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
9220613 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
9220614 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
9220615 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
9220616 gov crist now has an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the florida supreme court much like president bush has been able to do on the u s supreme court
9220617 hell be able to pick people who reflect his judgment and his conservative principles
9220618 theres no better way to accentuate your beliefs than with appointments to the court
9220619 this has not been a partisan court if i thought we were getting ideologues on the court id be concerned
9220620 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
9220621 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
9220622 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
9220623 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
9220624 a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9220625 the broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w
9220626 a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours
9220627 because defenders of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9220628 cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9220629 set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9220630 same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
9220631 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief
9220632 with the nomination of sen barack obama tonight the man who will lead the democratic party in its march toward the white house we are making a down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
9220633 not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
9220634 to be honest as much as americans politics is a fun spectator sport i personally havent seen it significantly influence a campaign in canada
9220635 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
9220636 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
9220637 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
9220638 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
9220639 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
9220640 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
9220641 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
9220642 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
9220643 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
9220644 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
9220645 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
9220646 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
9220647 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
9220648 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
9220649 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
9220650 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
9220651 obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
9220652 when i was in the snow and ice data center receiving a full briefing on the polar ice caps afterwards i would turn on my tv and there were two networks with the bulletin britney spears loses custody of her children were living in a madhouse if our priorities focus on the embalming of anna nicole smith or the trial of oj simpson while we ignore the greatest crisis this nation has ever faced global warming and climate change
9220653 well i know something about close elections so let me offer you my opinion
9220654 there is no better example than the climate crisis as i have said for many years throughout this land were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization every bit of that has to change
9220655 oil company profits as you know have soared to record levels and gasoline prices have gone through the roof and we are more dependent than ever on dirty and dangerous fossil fuels many scientists predict shockingly that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months during the first term of the next president sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger military experts warn us that our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions
9220656 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
9220657 and it just so happens that the climate crisis is intertwined with the other two great challenges facing our nation reviving our economy and strengthening our national security the solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon based fuels
9220658 instead of letting oil lobbyists and polluters control our destiny we need to invest in american green technology innovation
9220659 almost a hundred years ago thomas edison our most famous inventor said
9220660 well now in 2008 we already have everything we need to use the sun the wind geothermal power conservation and efficiency to solve the climate crisis everything that is except a president in the white house who inspires us to believe
9220661 so how did this no brainer become a brain twister because the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth and this same industry has spent a half a billion dollars this year alone trying to convince the public they are actually solving the problem when they are in fact making it worse every single day this bush administration and the special interests big oil who control it lock stock and barrel after barrel have performed this same sleight of hand deceit lies on issue after issue some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
9220662 what is your take on global warming and how it is affecting our country
9220663 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location but im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9220664 im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9220665 if one started to use biofuels and in reality that policy led to an increase in greenhouse gases rather than a decrease that would obviously be insane
9220666 in four short years bush turned that around and we now have debt for years to come
9220667 right now we need to campaign on turning virginia from a red state to a blue state
9220668 im talking to people every day who were republicans forever but are just not able to do it this year
9220669 for years and years they bought the plan to cut taxes but the middle class now is beginning to catch up with that idea and understand that a trick has been pulled on them
9220670 i want to vote for somebody who is going to deliver what he says he is going to do
9220671 forget about the wealthy think about the people and help the middle class rather than the wealthy
9220672 we have got a good start but we have our work cut out for us all across the country
9220673 we need to bring the lost to the light and reap the harvest
9220674 this election if probably one of the most important of my grandchildrens lives
9220675 i think historically we have left behind the disadvantaged and the people the policy was developed for
9220676 i think obama has done things more than any candidate to reach out to my generation
9220677 compare that to john mccain who said he barely knew how to use the internet and had to have help from his wife
9220678 the campaign of barack obama and joe biden is a very exciting one
9220679 we want a change that is going to help us all
9220680 their strength is not only how they campaign but how they govern
9220681 to put conservative values and conservative ideas into the thick of the fight for justice and opportunity
9220682 they had their chance they have not led we will
9220683 on occasion he rambled through excessive repetition bush is most effective in personal contact not a set speech
9220684 how and what we do for all of you the people who pay the taxes bear the burdens and live the american dream
9220685 cant understand how a guy like george w bush can be leading a guy with the kind of caliber experience and know how as al gore
9220686 make sure that our prosperity enriches not just the few but all working families
9220687 i believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning
9220688 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
9220689 right now the united states imports about 70 of its oil from overseas at the same time billions of dollars that we spend on all that foreign oil seems to end up in the bank accounts of those around the world who are openly hostile to american values and our way of life this costly reliance on fossil fuels threatens america and the world in other ways too co2 emissions are increasing global temperatures sea levels are rising and storms are getting worse
9220690 borrowing money from china to buy oil from saudi arabia
9220691 borrow ing money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us
9220692 as i have said for many years throughout this land were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9220693 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9220694 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9220695 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 per cent of the time
9220696 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9220697 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9220698 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9220699 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own
9220700 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
9220701 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9220702 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9220703 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9220704 the experience lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9220705 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9220706 tonight we witness in part what has become of his dream the acceptance of a democratic presidential nominee decided not by the colour of his skin but by the content of his character
9220707 a president who ends the global scourge of aids in our time
9220708 the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9220709 but surely we can agree that our gay brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9220710 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
9220711 because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change
9220712 hes said many times that the primary battle was historic and exciting and that in the end result it would be good for the democratic party that it would energize a lot of people and bring a lot of new people out
9220713 he expected all along that this would resolve itself elegantly and organically and it did
9220714 i think hes very happy with where we are we have a nominee a spectacular nominee and hes going to do everything he can to see him elected
9220715 we think gore can deliver a compelling message on both the economy and foreign policy as relates to energy
9220716 hes a messenger there are a lot of elected officials that voters dont readily accept information from and hes one that they do they think that hes got credibility he has some credibility because a lot of voters believe that if he were elected the last eight years would have been different
9220717 what he has said is that he is not interested in serving in a future administration but that he hasnt ruled out public office and that if he ran for office again it would probably be for president
9220718 he has found a very unique role and platform as a kind of public private citizen able to harness resources creatively to make a huge impact on the climate crisis
9220719 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
9220720 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
9220721 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
9220722 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
9220723 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
9220724 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
9220725 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
9220726 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
9220727 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
9220728 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
9220729 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
9220730 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
9220731 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
9220732 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
9220733 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
9220734 a little trivia for you today ladies and gentlemen in seat 9b is the best chocolate chip cookie maker in the whole world
9220735 right now in the second week of may 2006 we are facing perhaps the worst gas crisis in history
9220736 we have way too much gasoline gas is down to 19 cents a gallon and the oil companies are hurting i know that i am partly to blame by insisting that cars run on trash i am therefore proposing a federal bail out to our oil companies because hey if it were the other way around you know the oil companies would help us
9220737 i think he brought it to a new level of attention and validity that we hadnt had before
9220738 al gore has been warning us of the dangers of climate change for more than twenty years
9220739 when al won an academy award for his fine documentary an inconvenient truth i was thrilled america was finally listening to the lecture hed given me every week for eight years
9220740 he had written a great book before he was chosen as vice president
9220741 its easy to take shots its part of being a public figure and being in public office you catch a lot of arrows
9220742 al gore knew more about the importance of the rain forest than the scientists
9220743 i asked him a couple of questions and he began a tutorial flying 30 000 feet over the rain forest he told us how the important the rain forest was to the environment and how it affected weather patterns i didnt know that stuff it was one of those life changing moments that ill never forget
9220744 seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9220745 the question for the american people is whether they can make this odyssey that democratic delegates to the convention made seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9220746 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
9220747 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
9220748 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9220749 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9220750 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for those who are called to the cause of peace
9220751 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
9220752 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9220753 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
9220754 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
9220755 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
9220756 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9220757 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9220758 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
9220759 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9220760 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9220761 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9220762 look bro we are reaching if not already reached peak oil peak coal and peak natural gas
9220763 we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
9220764 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
9220765 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
9220766 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9220767 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9220768 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time
9220769 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9220770 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists that actually attacked us on 9 11
9220771 you know john mccain likes to say he will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
9220772 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
9220773 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9220774 doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
9220775 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
9220776 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
9220777 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
9220778 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
9220779 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
9220780 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9220781 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
9220782 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
9220783 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
9220784 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
9220785 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
9220786 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
9220787 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
9220788 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
9220789 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
9220790 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
9220791 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people
9220792 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
9220793 no ser a apropiado celebrar un evento as en momento en que se aproxima una tragedia
9220794 no ser a apropiado celebrar un evento as en momentos en que se aproxima una tragedia
9220795 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
9220796 i get it i realize that im not the likeliest candidate for this office
9220797 i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
9220798 one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9220799 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9220800 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9220801 let freedom ring from the snow capped rockies of colorado
9220802 to be able to fill up a stadium like this one the last night of the convention has never been done before
9220803 all these people wanted the opportunity to see and hear
9220804 we have come so far to have so many people of so many races to feel the same way about one person im very proud that we have come this far
9220805 there is an electricity about this convention that i dont remember from the three other democratic conventions that i have attended
9220806 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9220807 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques

9220822 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
9220823 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome
9220824 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
9220825 we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9220826 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
9220827 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9220828 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9220829 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
9220830 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9220831 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
9220832 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
9220833 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9220834 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9220835 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9220836 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9220837 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger
9220838 after they wrecked our economy its time for a change
9220839 after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change
9220840 powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9220841 barack obamas vision and his voice represent the best of america
9220842 it is that common american identity which barack obama exemplifies heart and soul that enables us as americans to speak with moral authority to all of the people of the world
9220843 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power
9220844 i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that
9220845 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
9220846 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
9220847 i knew abe abe was a friend of mine and baracks no lincoln
9220848 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
9220849 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that that election didnt matter
9220850 when he walks out on stage tonight in front of 75 000 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election
9220851 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
9220852 it was a very close election and certainly for a lot of people at that time who said theres no difference between al gore and
9220853 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress during which he showed courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country in a war that was popular when it started but later condemned by history
9220854 the experience that lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9220855 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land
9220856 he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity
9220857 gore compared obama to abe lincoln what a laugh abe was honest patriatic humble a great statesman obama is none of these obama is so very arrogant he reminds me of hitler
9220858 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
9220859 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
9220860 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9220861 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt matter who became president
9220862 today we face the same choice we faced in 2000
9220863 barack obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises
9220864 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in war in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9220865 this is about to become the most exciting election ever and mining issues may well be central

9220943 the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments

9220955 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9220956 i think it is important that government ministers and particularly me as chancellor level with people
9220957 i explained that what is happening to every country in the world ours included is that we have a credit crunch the like of which we have not seen for generations
9220958 who is telling the truth at the top of government the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9220959 the reason for the good result is careful planning and a qualified and enthusiastic organization

9220977 bisher hatte ich immer schlechte blutsenkungswerte leider auch schlechte blutzuckerwerte und dar ber hinaus auch hautprobleme seit 6 wochen nehme ich t glich 2 30ml antioxidativen mangostan saft mit zus tzlich angereicherten naturstoffen f r den zellschutz zu mir in dieser zeit habe ich alles andere weggelassen meine antibiotika und auch meine zuckertabletten mein blutsenkungswert hat sich von 75 mm auf 15 mm verbessert der blutsenkungswert zeigt an ob im k rper entz ndungen vorhanden sind und mit 15 mm liege ich im normalbereich durch die saftmischung hat sich auch mein blutzucker normalisiert vorher 160 mg dl blutzucker n chternwert liege ich jetzt mit 90 mg dl im normalbereich eines gesunden meine zuckertabletten brauche ich jetzt nicht mehr auch meine haut ist besser geworden ich hatte immer viele flecken viele davon sind inzwischen weg
9220978 seit 18 jahren habe ich typ ii diabetes ich musste mich bei jeder mahlzeit spritzen trotzdem waren meine blutzuckerwerte meist ber 300 dann lernte ich anfang dezember 2007 den mangostan fl ssigradikalf nger kennen vier wochen nach der ersten einnahme waren meine blutzuckerwerte so gut dass ich seither nicht mehr spritzen muss heute liegen meine werte zwischen 120 und 140 mg dl ich trinke t glich 4 x 30ml mangostan
9220979 durch den antioxidativen mangostan saft ist mein blutzucker langzeitwert hba1 c von ehemals ber 7 auf 5 3 gesunken
9220980 das geheime wissen unz hliger generationen von inselbewohnern aus dem asiatischen und karibischen raum ber die ph nomenale wirkung der mangostan auf gesundheit und langlebigkeit ist erst durch den weltweiten tourismus bis zu uns vorgedrungen kaum eine frucht ist bei uns in der westlichen welt so unbekannt wie die garcinia mangostana dabei forscht man seit vielen jahren ber sie

9220988 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9220989 im very worried that the city is going to get hit again and i dont want to be here when that happens
9220990 i think its great that they are on top of the game early this time
9220991 i think a lot more people will be satisfied this time than last time
9220992 we are absolutely delighted with the news that pope benedict xvi has written this prayer i first wrote to him 18 months ago outlining our plans for the pilgrimage
9220993 earlier this year i was invited to address a plenary session of the pontifical council for the family at which i spoke about the role of grandparents in society and in the church today
9220994 it is clear that the vatican is interested in exploring the value of grandparents who in many cases are the people holding families together at a time of great social change
9220995 grandparents are also crucial figures in transmitting the faith from generation to generation and the fact that his holiness the pope has recognised this fact with this new prayer will mean a great deal to catholic grandparents all over the world
9220996 last year the basilica was filled to capacity and we are hoping for another huge crowd this year
9220997 i got the idea for the pilgrimage when i started to realise just how important a part grandmothers and grandfathers play in so many families they are baby sitters when parents are so busy with their working lives and they also have a unique relationship with their grandchildren

9221064 the discovery of a biogenic material that is one formed by a biological organism with ferromagnetic properties and found to be magnetite was the first breakthrough toward an understanding as to why some animals have the ability to detect the earths magnetic field searches for biogenic magnetite in human tissues had not been conclusive until the beginning of the 1990s when work with high resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron diffraction on human brain tissue extracts of the cerebral cortex cerebellum and meninges membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord identified magnetite maghemite crystals

9221067 its a narrow track so there are not a lot of opportunities to get by and its going to be very critical to set up the passes and get good runs out of the corners the race is going to be all about staying out of trouble and not getting involved in an incident with lapped traffic

9221070 were the only brigade flying two vehicles at a time with zero accidents
9221071 the biggest difference is working directly side by side with other brigade tuas platoons at the same site location it also seems like the maintenance section is a little more distant from the brigade during our last deployment we were all at the same location we usually had an idea of what happened during the flights this time we dont really see that
9221072 the biggest thing ive learned is team work especially while working with various tuav platoons from different brigades
9221073 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9221074 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9221075 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9221076 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9221077 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9221078 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9221079 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9221080 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9221081 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9221082 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9221083 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9221084 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9221085 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9221086 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9221087 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9221088 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9221089 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9221090 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9221091 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9221092 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9221093 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9221094 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9221095 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9221096 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9221097 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9221098 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9221099 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9221100 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9221101 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9221102 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9221103 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9221104 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9221105 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9221106 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9221107 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9221108 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9221109 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9221110 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9221111 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9221112 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9221113 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9221114 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9221115 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9221116 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9221117 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9221118 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9221119 who are open to doing something on the production side
9221120 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9221121 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9221122 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9221123 it will be miserable if we stay no water no power
9221124 obviously people can stay we are encouraging them to leave
9221125 we know this is a very difficult decision emotions are very high but we have to take a practical approach to this
9221126 we are getting information earlier buses are coming they got it a whole lot better this time during katrina not one thing was organized it was a state of panic and havoc
9221127 im supposed to be leaving but i keep waiting just a little longer to see what the storm is going to do i know its a risk
9221128 president bush called to make sure the states were receiving all the assistance they needed from the federal government
9221129 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9221130 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9221131 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9221132 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9221133 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9221134 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9221135 andrew has nothing to say hes not doing any media interviews
9221136 we have focused on a duty of care for andrew and we are concerned about his mental welfare he had a long and demanding summer
9221137 if you dont fulfil those unfortunately you are not going to be on our squad you need to be committed 100 per cent
9221138 i hope he goes away from this and gets himself right and gets himself back into our team because he is a very important player and we certainly want him as a part of our squad
9221139 he caught some good barra and was going to take out some of the boys from the cricket team next week
9221140 hes got to reassess where hes at if hes doing these things its not the first time
9221141 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9221142 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9221143 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9221144 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9221145 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9221146 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9221147 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

9221157 ich glaube kaum ein team konnte die session wie geplant durchziehen
9221158 das hat nat rlich auch ein bisschen hektik in die sache gebracht aber daf r sind meine jungs auf jeden fall sch n ruhig geblieben
9221159 es ist schon schwierig da ruhig und fokussiert zu bleiben und es nicht an sich ran zu lassen mir ist es zwei mal passiert dass ich drau en war und gelb kam bzw rot
9221160 ich bin stinksauer geworden weil es wirklich total nervig ist wenn man rausf hrt man wei dass man neue reifen drauf hat und jedes mal wieder abbrechen muss entweder gleich in der outlap oder in der ersten gezeiteten runde weil gelb oder rot ist
9221161 f r mich gab es kein q1 deswegen habe ich im auto gesessen und gewartet
9221162 das hat es f r mich weniger hektisch gemacht da ich weniger fahren musste
9221163 f r mich gab es kein q1 deswegen habe ich im auto gesessen und gewartet
9221164 ich bin immer relaxt im fahrzeug es gab zwar ein paar unterbrechungen aber ich bin ruhig geblieben
9221165 meistens ist ja die erste session die nerv seste von allen man will unbedingt und die top 14 reinkommen und keine fehler machen
9221166 durch die schnelle rotphase wurde es sogar ein bisschen ruhiger im auto und auch bei uns am boxenstand oben
9221167 ich habe von den vier satz slicks die ich benutzt habe im prinzip drei die genau deshalb futsch waren
9221168 mit dem reifensatz braucht man dann nicht mehr rauszufahren der ist nur die erste oder zweite runde da
9221169 dementsprechend ist es schon rgerlich wenn so etwas passiert und mit ist es gleich zwei mal passiert
9221170 ich habe von den vier satz slicks die ich benutzt habe im prinzip drei die genau deshalb futsch waren
9221171 wenn rot ist musst du in die box da ist der reifen schon benutzt der peak ist weg und bei gelb genauso
9221172 wir waren zu dem zeitpunkt noch in den boxen und waren gar nicht rausgefahren
9221173 ich denke nicht dass ich zu sp t gebremst habe vielleicht waren die bremsen nicht warm genug aber das vorderrad hat blockiert und wenn das passiert wirst du nicht langsamer
9221174 es war die erste runde und ich habe nicht zu hart gepusht
9221175 ich habe so gebremst wie immer kein ahnung warum der vorderreifen auf einmal blockiert hat ich habe die kurve nur ganz knapp nicht nehmen k nnen
9221176 the aim was not to take any risks and not to fall off
9221177 we didnt want to lose too much time on the other favourites either and thats what happened
9221178 wed been and checked out the course we were motivated we wanted the win
9221179 im very grateful to the team for letting me cross the line first particularly as im leaving at the end of the year for new squad katyusha its a great way to bow out of the team
9221180 its possible the finish is slightly uphill which is good for me so ill try to go for the win but we shouldnt forget bennati either hes in great shape and hes hungry for a win too

9221297 yep i like that oh yeah i like that too
9221298 by the way i am never too busy for your referrals
9221299 ok lets talk about your gfe what was the apr like this looks a little off but im sure we can clear it up on the hud
9221300 when joe bidens brother and son wanted to buy a hedge fund
9221301 said jeffrey cooper former managing partner of simmonscooper and simmonscooper employees have donated about 200 000 00 to bidens campaign efforts since 2001 making the firm his no 1 doner his familys financial dealings could be troublesome for biden who wednesday night became part of a democratic presidential ticket that has vowed to reform washingtons traditional money culture whats clear is that simmonscoopers interests in washington were clearly aligned with bidens philosophical views and his position on the judiciary committee was enormously important to such a firm
9221302 a few months after that bit of senate dream the complex deal involving the senators brother and son moved forward
9221303 orz tokyo akazukin on my computer for a few weeks now and was planning on reading it after catching up with
9221304 in dry times water is worth a lot more and is sold at a higher price
9221305 are there social media tools and apps for which you once had high hopes that you now find yourself using and visiting less often
9221306 non sai quanto mi piacerebbe ucciderti ma sono felice che lei stia al caldo
9221307 and let me tell you how i intend to pay for all of these necessary programs
9221308 non strano come un libro diventi pi spesso se viene letto e riletto di continuo come se ogni volta fra le pagine rimanesse attaccato qualcosa sensazioni pensieri rumori odori e quando a distanza di anni li riapri ritrovi te stesso un p pi giovane un po diverso quasi il libro ti avesse conservato come un fiore fatto seccare fra le pagine un po estraneo e un po familiare
9221309 i have been busy reading religious texts you know as i am supposed to do because i am a monk
9221310 no i do not understand why all of my students are occupying themselves with these frivolities instead of studying scripture
9221311 acolyte han has been spending all his time writing poetry for the easily courted young women of the village acolyte zhou will not stop training for a swim meet that is eleven months away and acolyte wei is completely obsessed with that yo yo of his and now here you are studying another scientific theory have you all forgotten that this is a place of learning how do you intend to ever reach enlightenment
9221312 you see many worlds theory teaches us that there is a different alternate universe for every choice we make indeed every single possible outcome has its own universe and just as there are an infinite number of possible outcomes so too are there an infinite number of universes
9221313 so somewhere out there there is an acolyte ming who has chosen to devote all her time and energy to studying the buddha in silence
9221314 in fact that is exactly why i am studying the theory there is an alternate universe somewhere where an alternate acolyte ming has already attained enlightenment if i find a way study her then i can replicate her technique and attain enlightenment myself
9221315 i would be willing to bet that her technique involves years of study and very few distractions
9221316 perhaps but there is no way to know that for certain no im afraid the only thing to do is to find a way to study this alternate universe
9221317 just to make sure that i am completely up to speed on your plan instead of spending several years studying enlightenment directly you intend to spend several years studying an unrelated scientific theory in order that you may come to learn that you need to spend several more years studying enlightenment directly
9221318 tell me acolyte ming there are an infinite number of possible universes correct
9221319 including a universe where you spend the rest of your life attempting to learn about this alternate universe and never succeed
9221320 and a universe where you find out how alternate acolyte ming attained enlightenment but cannot replicate the circumstances in your universe
9221321 and a universe where you think youve found out how alternate acolyte ming attained enlightenment but actually you were mistaken and you spend years trying to replicate something which didnt work or never happened
9221322 well good luck with your studies im sure they will be fruitful
9221323 what have we here the golden fern annals the chronicles of master liang acolyte ming are you studying buddhist texts
9221324 unfortunately they are not as helpful as i had hoped not one of them mentions many worlds theory at all
9221325 cos mai questa nostra patria che difendiamo qual lidea che ci sospinge nella lotta contro loppressione fascista
9221326 lidea della patria come limmagine della bandiera nazionale unastratta creazione del potere questa subordina la libert dellindividuo alla fedelt alle tradizioni anche quelle peggiori imponendo la subordinazione di ogni energia intellettuale e materiale agli oscuri disegni della politica secondo me dovrebbe esistere una sola patria il mondo un solo popolo lumanit solo in quel caso lideale della patria contribuirebbe alla pace universale al contrario oggi esistono tante patrie quanti sono i governi che le creano e anzi molte di pi quelle inventate dagli schieramenti dovuti a interessi politici economici confessionali la sola patria che ho scoperto costituita dalla musica

9221330 sometimes i wish i were a little kid again skinned knees are easier to fix than broken hearts

9221380 das ganze jahr ist mehr oder weniger bitter verlaufen bei den grand slams mit australian open und wimbledon erste runde paris dritte runde und us open zweite runde das ist alles andere als zufrieden stellend

9221547 a lot of people in the activist community are really on pins and needles about whos next
9221548 we went after the police and i was in the second row i was tear gassed
9221549 under our constitution the people have the right to demonstrate just as they do in other democracies
9221550 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
9221551 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
9221552 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
9221553 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can
9221554 its looking more likely than it was before these meetings
9221555 he said that he doubted that there was any common ground

9221557 put concerted non violent efforts to bring a natural end to the torture and persecution in tibet
9221558 this is a very solemn moment for all the tibetans
9221559 this is a time to reflect on how we did this year for freedom and a moment to pause and think for ourselves in these trying times of our history
9221560 our aim is for every single school to welcome children from all backgrounds it is a simple goal strongly supported by the public educationalists and students
9221561 there are those who attend church in order that their children qualify for admission to a particular school and never set foot in the church again after the children have been accepted
9221562 all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9221563 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9221564 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children the bottom line is that faith schools are successful thriving popular and here to stay
9221565 it is down to locally accountable councils and communities themselves not some campaign group to decide what sort of schools they should have
9221566 given the dangers of segregation and the importance of community cohesion we need schools that welcome all and are committed to non discrimination
9221567 they stole the election again lets plan to retake america in 2012 moveon org all praise george clooney

9221569 whats troubling is that even if it was the israelis it happened in damascus in a safe area meters from the office of intelligence chief assef shawkat
9221570 the americans are making up stories about me and hold me responsible for a lot of attacks against them that happened around the world
9221571 sometimes they think of me as if i have the key to the universe it is difficult for them to understand that i am part of an institution that patiently plans and designs its moves
9221572 im very confident that there will be an absolute clearance for mr peters in a relatively short period of time
9221573 this is an abject failure of the indian state to protect the right to life of the citizens since all entry roads have been blocked with logs and the law enforcement personnel have access to remote areas of the district the hindu fundamentalists are being allowed to carry out mass killings of the christians

9221583 on a plane from denver to charlotte following the democrats convention i found myself seated behind former national chairman of the democratic national committee don fowler and congressman john spratt of south carolina their conversation was interesting to say the least for example they made fun of sarah palin for several minutes fowler calling her dan quayle on steroids and spratt creatively describing her as just terrible they both agreed that other than the simple fact that shes a female she has nothing to offer then there was this gem of a moment from fowler
9221584 we were just just kidding hope everyone is getting out safely and such
9221585 sometime you really have wonder at what cost some are willing to see their political ideology advanced
9221586 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven

9221596 its always fun to be like what is that what are you talking about and pretend you dont know
9221597 its just a way to be someone else for a little while and kind of let go and get away from everyday stresses

9221602 i want to build a country thats based on good social values
9221603 about an hour and a half ago 20 to 30 heavily armed police officers surrounded the house
9221604 one of my roommates said i want to see a warrant and she was immediately detained
9221605 how you did figure out there was a raid going on
9221606 it sounded like people were falling down on my porch
9221607 cops were running up both sides of the house onto the porch
9221608 i was in the army i was a military police officer i wouldnt have done this
9221609 you figure this would be going on in south africa or russia not in st paul
9221610 gina cobb is proof that not all lawyers deserve the death penalty
9221611 president bush called gov palin and congratulated her bush told palin the job of vice president is very important because as vice president you get to tell the president what to do
9221612 when they were vetting her for this job like three seconds ago she said quote im not making this up what is it exactly that the vp does every day let me field that for you sarah they start wars they enrich their friends they subvert the constitution and they shoot people in the face thats what the vice president does
9221613 walker is well respected but the board rejected the bid and rightly so its not a good deal for woolies or shareholders

9221618 im sorry that we werent able to succeed in accomplishing what our goal was which was keeping baseball here in nashua
9221619 i think stabile is belly aching because he is down in the housing industry
9221620 it is the same story every year and you know what john i am sorry sales are down i think it is great that the community has a baseball team but if you dont want it sell it we will get along fine
9221621 this is not a city that supports this type of venue
9221622 in other cities and small towns the team would be embraced as opposed to nashua where it is barely noticed
9221623 young professionals are part of the crowd that would attend those games
9221624 this city needs to figure out what its mission is
9221625 there are so many things that work in other cities that dont work here
9221626 id rather have something in there than have an empty stadium because i dont want all the riff raff
9221627 i think that nashua benefits from having a professional ball team in the community
9221628 it provides such a great opportunity for families and others to come together
9221629 my goal is to try to keep something in that beautiful stadium
9221630 its a good location and although attendance has been down its been a good organization for the league
9221631 however its not as if theres somebody out there ready to pounce weve got about a month to do something
9221632 certainly if something were brewing on the stove bubbling away we could say lets wait a little longer
9221633 they called and said what about nashua its still preliminary
9221634 thats the biggest negative for it but its a good ballpark a lot of good history a lot of good things the night i was there a friday in june there were 2 000 people there everyone was having fun this year the weather was a factor its hurt everybody even us in quebec
9221635 if somebody said we need to see if this could work then we might do that require just one year
9221636 you have to wonder arent there five people in this community who have 200 000 to put into it
9221637 the teams been here 11 seasons and the best they did was lose 300 000
9221638 for the three years stabile has been here theres been no profit at all who is going to come and look at this we have to find a way to make it attractive to do something in this stadium look out this window its a beautiful ballpark
9221639 what are we talking about another 20 nights of this of close to 1 800 per night and it would have been fine john would have stayed if he was breaking even or as stabile said losses didnt exceed 300 000 he didnt need to make money he just needed to not spend it
9221640 john gave us a pretty good speech about putting his heart into it and trying to keep this going for the community
9221641 i just listened to him and kind of have nothing but respect for the effort hes given us the past three years all i can think about is all those smiling faces when i walk through the stands
9221642 i just hope somebody comes and keeps that going for nashua because boy we need it
9221643 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9221644 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9221645 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9221646 the worst linespeople are usually on the outside courts where you need it more thats the problem with the system
9221647 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9221648 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9221649 im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9221650 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9221651 who likes drama do you know anybody that likes to get involved into tight matches
9221652 so hopefully those long passes and runs will all go for touchdowns so we dont have to worry about getting up there and getting a play off in time
9221653 our offensive coordinators and coaching staffs like this because in the past youre always at the mercy of each referee being a little different each crew being a little different now were consistent
9221654 the offensive team can come up and snap it with 39 seconds on the clock or they can let it run all the way down to 1 the offensive team determines the pace at which theyre going to operate not the official
9221655 what i told doug is i want to see where are you going to get the ball ready as opposed to when that 40 seconds starts and how much time do i really have
9221656 if were no huddling people i want that ball and i want our team over that ball with 33 seconds am i going to be able to do it can i snap it with 33 seconds can i speed the game up or can i significantly slow the game down with a 40 second clock
9221657 we practice that hustling getting downfield coming back and looking out for somebody to come in for us if were being substituted for
9221658 coach always urges us to get out of the huddle and get to the line fast so it wont be anything to us were accustomed and probably already adapted
9221659 im just going to try to score because i know those guys dont want to run
9221660 how successful we will be will be will rely on when the team starts believing in themselves
9221661 we need to play to our full potential to be successful
9221662 well need to rely on our older guys if we want to win
9221663 we have the experience this year to be one of the best teams in the state
9221664 if all of our players can crack 50 we will certainly improve
9221665 we have strength from top to bottom meaning a definite improvement over last season
9221666 because of our inexperience we need our leaders to step up
9221667 we lost some of our top guys so we really need our younger guys to step up
9221668 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster watch video of sen mccain introducing gov sarah palin as his running mate browse a slide show of photos of gov palin discuss mccains pick in west watch so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9221669 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9221670 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9221671 everything came out i guess the word would be awesome
9221672 everything is clean there were a number of tests and josh came through with flying colors
9221673 but looking at the rest of the year that would be a great day to start him and get him back in the rotation
9221674 i think we put it off because i think everybody is scared at some point in time whether it be me or the organization you end up putting things off
9221675 i got so excited about the way he threw the ball but he had that look in his eye
9221676 we all felt like this was the right thing to do if youre a first baseman and your knee hurts you get through the game if youre a pitcher and youre throwing about 97 its nice to know that when you let it go youre going to be ok
9221677 it think it will be one of those things where you wake up one morning and its ok
9221678 the next few days hopefully ill be ready to go i definitely feel better than i did six days ago
9221679 the medical staff is going to have to sit on him especially with an oblique because when you feel good you cant let him do too much
9221680 look maam thats just not the way things work around here
9221681 then can you tell me who can fix it where can i get this fixed or where i can get it exchanged for one that wont break so easily
9221682 id love to help but youre askin the wrong guy youre just going to have to deal with what youve got

9221711 washingtons broken were worse off than we were four years ago
9221712 press releases calling her the girlfriend of satan and the most dangerous hateful maniac in history are no doubt flying off the laser printers of gay democratic hacks as we speak
9221713 america may not know much about sarah palin but based on what our community has seen of her we know enough
9221714 sarah palin not only supported the 1998 alaska constitutional amendment banning marriage equality but in her less than two years as governor even expressed the extreme position of supporting stripping away domestic partner benefits for state workers when you cant even support giving our community the rights to health insurance and pension benefits its a frightening window into where she stands on equality
9221715 si je puis dire aient envie davoir un peu de reve
9221716 the use of the baku tbilisi ceyhan and baku supsa oil pipeline of the baku tbilisi erzurum gas pipeline and of a number of other transportation units as well as the cessation of rail deliveries of oil to the georgian port of batumi was stopped
9221717 to search for alternative routes for the transportation of this resource as a result azerbaijani oil has been flowing through the baku novorossiysk pipeline and turkey intends to purchase additional gas from russia and iran to compensate
9221718 iran for example has decided to build the neka jask pipeline as a competitor to baku tbilisi jeyhan
9221719 all western oil companies would like to work in iran
9221720 invoking the situation in georgia they are beginning to advise official washington to review its relations with iranian so as to allow them to begin work there
9221721 azerbaijan began to export its oil to international markets through iran
9221722 we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law
9221723 the gospel itself refers to the proclamation that jesus the crucified and risen messiah is the one true and only lord of the world
9221724 that the crucified jesus of nazareth had been raised from the dead that he was thereby proved to be israels messiah
9221725 the gospel is not an account of how people get saved it is the proclamation of the lordship of jesus christ
9221726 pauls gospel to the pagans was not a philosophy of life nor was it even a doctrine about how to get saved
9221727 my proposal has been that the gospel is not for paul a message about how one gets saved
9221728 the gospel is not a set of techniques for making people christians
9221729 justification is not how someone becomes a christian it is the declaration that they have become a christian
9221730 justification in the first century was not about how someone might establish a relationship with god it was about gods eschatological definition both future and present of who was in fact a member of his people
9221731 justification was not so much about getting in or indeed about staying in as about how you could tell who was in
9221732 i no longer count you guilty i count you as righteous with the righteousness of my son
9221733 i must stress again that the doctrine of justification by faith is not what paul means by the gospel
9221734 why do you call me lord lord and do not do the things that i demand of you
9221735 and she has been a friend of big oil opposing a windfall profits tax on the oil industry that could fund affordable clean energy for more americans
9221736 palin opposes greater protections for beluga whales found in the cook inlet where oil and gas drilling and other development is proposed
9221737 she and other alaska elected officials fear a listing will cripple oil and gas development in prime polar bear habitat off the states northern and northwestern coasts
9221738 in fact there is insufficient evidence that polar bears are in danger of becoming extinct within the foreseeable future
9221739 predicted polar bears in alaska could be wiped out by 2050
9221740 the governors decision was clearly based on politics not on science and was primarily designed to protect the oil and gas industry stampede into the arctic ocean
9221741 nine polar bears are at risk of drowning after the ice floe where they lived melted because of global warming
9221742 professor richard steiner of the university of alaskas marine advisory program said
9221743 i beg to disagree with any candidate who would say we cant drill our way out of our problem or that more supply wont ultimately affect prices of course it will affect prices
9221744 the u s energy information administration an independent statistical agency within the department of energy concluded that new oil from anwr would lower the world price of oil by no more than 1 44 per barrel and possibly have
9221745 even if we drilled the entire state of alaska and pulled new refineries out of thin air the impact on gas prices would be minimal and delayed at best
9221746 it is hard to think of a more cynical and contemptuous political act this year than john mccains selection of sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate
9221747 everyone is focusing on helio castroneves and scott dixon and we have another championship going on between me and dan
9221748 its six points and we only have two races to go its pretty tight and im behind him so hopefully ill catch him
9221749 right now its their championship so im going to try and not get in the way and benefit one or the other
9221750 but im also here to win races so if i can im going to take it away from them
9221751 i couldnt give my all because of my left hand
9221752 i was turning into the pits with just one hand on the steering wheel and was unable to do my best
9221753 i was rusty a little bit getting back behind the wheel of an open wheel car but i feel good in the car
9221754 i always find that here you have to push so hard to qualify
9221755 obviously we didnt have enough for scott dixon at all i dont know how he did that lap but im just very happy for the team to be third again
9221756 every session were closing up the gap i feel like if this was a 38 race nascar season wed be right up there with dixon and castroneves
9221757 dearest hmm i know nothing about what youre going through i know i have to do some homework trying to sometimes i wished i was at least id be able to help you i love you hmm i always will and youre beautiful and youre smart and youre eiliaw and youre the reason i leave my laptop on till morn too have a great day ahead mwahxx love jill

9221759 when i am constantly running there is no time for being when there is no time for being there is no time for listening i will never understand the silent dying of the green pie apple tree if i do not slow down and listen to what the spirit is telling me telling me of the death of trees the death of planeters of people and what all these deaths mean in the light of love of the creator who brought them all into being who brought me into being and you
9221760 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington
9221761 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9221762 she was criticized for being too young too inexperienced and too naive
9221763 yet time after time over the years underestimating sarah always proved to be a big mistake
9221764 i believe its extremely important for the people of jackson county mo to sit on the jury and decide this case
9221765 this signals the return of competition in the banking sector
9221766 the banks have been slowly increasing their profit margins but this will bring them back in line
9221767 its a risk but we are cutting rates now because the cost of funding our mortgages has fallen irrespective of the cash rate and it is only fair that we pass that saving on to our customers
9221768 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation

9221834 the findings mean that at least 20 000 troops are on medication such as prozac or diamorphine while serving in the front line or on equally dangerous convoy escort or driving duties in conflicts where insurgents regularly target the supply chain
9221835 while the vast majority would have been barred automatically from combat roles in earlier wars on medical and safety grounds the pressure to provide up to 200 000 soldiers at any given time for the two major deployments has led to a relaxation of the rules
9221836 the pentagon admitted that medication was tolerated because those sent to afghanistan or iraq were younger and healthier than the general population and had been screened for mental illnesses before enlisting

9221890 she has executive experience she has a much greater understanding of the international oil markets and she certainly has the qualifications to be president

9221907 the total number of polar bears worldwide is estimated to be 20 000 25 000
9221908 he assured me of his abiding commitment to work with the state to take actions to conserve polar bears protect their habitat and manage sustainable uses
9221909 alaska is home to a healthy population of polar bears we intend to keep it that way
9221910 i am concerned that the determination made by the u s fish and wildlife service is based on incomplete information
9221911 i want secretary kempthorne to have all the facts at his disposal before he makes a final decision the consequences of listing the polar bear will have widespread social and economic impacts without providing any more protection for the bears
9221912 the state recognizes that a recent warming trend in portions of the arctic is occurring but the causes and effects are more diverse complex and scientifically debated than is recognized in the usgs reports
9221913 as a result the link between projected warming and the polar bear population in 50 years is highly speculative and questionable polar bears survived prior warming periods greater than the current one the state notes that numerous respected scientists around the world question the forecasting methodologies used to project impacts to polar bears
9221914 the listing of a currently healthy species based entirely on highly speculative and uncertain climate and ice modeling and equally uncertain and speculative modeling of possible impacts on a species would be unprecedented
9221915 the center for biological diversity an environmental group has argued that global warming and the reduction of polar ice severely threatens the bears habitat and their existence in fact there is insufficient evidence that polar bears are in danger of becoming extinct within the foreseeable future the trigger for protection under the endangered species act
9221916 and there is no evidence that polar bears are being mismanaged through existing international agreements and the federal marine mammal protection act
9221917 polar bears are more numerous now than they were 40 years ago the polar bear population in the southern beaufort sea off alaskas north slope has been relatively stable for 20 years according to a federal analysis
9221918 the center for biological diversity which petitioned for the polar bear to be protected wants the listing to force the government to either stop or severely limit any public or private action that produces or even allows the production of greenhouse gases
9221919 but the endangered species act is not the correct tool to address climate change the act itself actually prohibits any consideration of broader issues
9221920 what is justified is worldwide concern over the proven effects of climate change
9221921 americans should become involved in the issue of climate change by offering suggestions for constructive action to their state governments
9221922 but listing the polar bear as threatened is the wrong way to get to the right answer
9221923 although the population of bears has grown from a low of about 12 000 in the late 1960s to approximately 25 000 today our scientists advise me that computer modeling projects a significant population decline by the year 2050
9221924 this in my judgment makes the polar bear a threatened species one likely to become in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future i have accepted the science presented to me by the fish and wildlife service and the u s geological survey
9221925 i will do everything within my power as governor to protect the interests of the people of alaska
9221926 i also want to do my part to minimize the impact of the secretarys decision on the economy of the nation
9221927 i want to assure alaskans that my administration through the department of law will join with those parties seeking to challenge significant elements of the secretarys listing decision
9221928 without question litigation challenging the secretarys decision will be of immense significance to alaska and the nation
9221929 i would not be at all surprised if the case is ultimately decided by the u s supreme court as governor i believe that my responsibility requires full state participation beginning at the trial court and ending with the last appeal
9221930 we don t believe that this speculation again unprecedented on computer modeling could forecast the effects of climate change to the degree that leaves us in a comfortable position
9221931 its just too far out into the future this speculative modeling
9221932 and we remain committed to ensuring that our polar bears are conserved and we re going to continue to monitor the populations and their behaviors in relation to that changing sea ice condition
9221933 but you know i will tell you neil as you know if extreme environmentalists have their way and we do believe that what they would like to see some of them is oil and gas development shut down on alaska s north slope then the economic impact to our nation would really be catastrophic there
9221934 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
9221935 alaska is on the front line of global warming impacts and the polar bear is our canary in the coal mine
9221936 the states lawsuit isnt about the science of global warming and polar bears it is merely doing the bidding of oil companies that want to drill for oil in sensitive polar bear habitat without any concern for how that oil will impact the climate when its burned
9221937 the state of alaskas challenge to the protection of the polar bear is a lost cause based on discredited industry funded attacks on science
9221938 they have taken their cues from industry every step of the way
9221939 my e mail in box is bursting with enthusiasm from loyal gopers whove been either glum cynical or downright unhappy for the past two years

9222143 muy bien he recuperado mi felicidad y me siento con mucho entusiasmo para seguir adelante
9222144 s hay que tragar sapos pero s lo por una buena raz n no por nada a cambio
9222145 no podr a ni tendr a que responder esta pregunta lo que hago con la maestra elba esther son acuerdos para la educaci n
9222146 en esta secretar a solamente cumplir con los acuerdos a quienes les debemos son a los ni os a los estudiantes
9222147 mientras se respeten las reglas institucionales y tengamos claros los prop sitos tenemos que considerar acuerdos transparentes
9222148 mis maestros me dieron muy buenas calificaciones en el colegio y m s en disciplina
9222149 estamos ante un reto desafiante es la primera vez en la agenda educativa nacional y lo m s importante es que si el m rito regresa a las aulas cambiar n miles de desempe os en el pa s
9222150 nosotros estamos obligados a seguir adelante es empezar a enfrentar realidades
9222151 claro no tengo duda es una mujer pol tica audaz y cuando da su palabra por lo menos en mi caso hasta ahora la ha cumplido
9222152 no es cuesti n de aprendizaje con ella he construido acuerdos para sumar y lo que quiero es multiplicar para la calidad de la educaci n
9222153 no s si en otras instancias habr una agenda adicional pero aqu es solamente por la calidad de la educaci n
9222154 hay que preguntarle a quienes han tenido que pagarla por lo que sabemos cuesta varios miles de pesos en el menor de los casos
9222155 parece ser que as ha sucedido no tengo una evidencia pero no tengo por qu dudar de que cuando hay discrecionalidad y corrupci n no hay l mites
9222156 hoy estamos hablando de cerca de 7 mil plazas pero a lo largo del a o tendremos alrededor de 25 mil
9222157 s mele de a 30 mil promedio por cada una
9222158 a ver si no la definen la secretar a del 10
9222159 lo que estamos haciendo en esta serie de decisiones es transparentar todo y generar la agenda educativa del pa s estoy consciente del desaf o que representa s que se requiere fortaleza
9222160 apenas hemos tenido voluntad de los gobiernos estatales creo que para todos es un aprendizaje y una apuesta que es novedosa inaudita pero todos sabemos que si no la hacemos no estamos cumpliendo con nuestra obligaci n estaremos traicionando en gran medida los sue os de los mexicanos
9222161 hace muchos a os que estoy a prueba en este pa s las mujeres estamos a prueba en pol tica todos los d as
9222162 hasta ahora parece que vamos aprobando esta materia y no tengo ning n inter s en que cambie mi est ndar de calificaci n
9222163 trabajo incansablemente y quiero de verdad construir con todos muchos puentes
9222164 para transformar en buena medida la agenda educativa del pa s
9222165 en infraestructura para cerrar tantas distancias que hay en el pa s transformar la red de la informaci n de los ciudadanos transformar para crear un nimo distinto y mirar a la escuela como una escuela de todos
9222166 seguramente habr muchos que me calificar n yo solamente quiero seguir haciendo mi mejor esfuerzo
9222167 intento operar igual e incluso con mucho m s actores porque la circunstancia del pa s hoy es distinta la agenda educativa debe ser la agenda de la reconstrucci n nacional
9222168 mi estancia en la sedesol fue probablemente el tiempo donde menos se partidiz la pol tica social donde abrimos los padrones donde se dieron las condiciones para superar la pobreza en gran medida tuve una gran responsabilidad en la campa a de felipe calder n y es sabido por todos que pude hablar con todos los gobernadores en la campa a m s pol mica y creo que ellos jam s hubieran aceptado que hubi ramos tenido un manejo electoral de la pol tica
9222169 estamos totalmente comprometidos he pedido ayuda a la pfp a todos los gobiernos estatales al ej rcito nacional queremos un proceso confiable y cre ble para los mexicanos
9222170 yo tengo la apuesta de que tenemos que hacer todo por creer en ella
9222171 no quiero pensar en eso quiero pensar en que los ciudadanos nos acompa en para que sean ellos quienes nos certifiquen y que somos capaces de hacerlo
9222172 no es parte de la alianza sa ser decisi n de cada identidad federativa
9222173 no yo tengo buena ficha seguramente muy aburrida y mi nico prop sito con las drogas es fortalecer una agenda de seguridad en las escuelas cada ni o que rescatemos ser una vida mucho mejor
9222174 es lograr que los ni os mexicanos aprendan mejor las matem ticas las ciencias que vayan a la escuela con alegr a que aprendan a ser respetuosos tolerantes y que aprendan a amar m xico con un amor mucho m s cercano
9222175 de ninguna manera es una gran apuesta y la educaci n p blica es insustituible
9222176 en primera instancia es responsabilidad del estado pero todos tenemos algo importante que hacer con ella
9222177 deber a de servir para tener m s acceso para tomar mejores decisiones y sobre todo para ser m s humano
9222178 noo eso casi todos quieren ser la verdad es que la educaci n tiene que ser una apuesta de libertad
9222179 s que el presidente est haciendo todos los esfuerzos para que m xico vaya por el camino correcto
9222180 se refiere a los caminos de dar certeza con menos crimen con m s prevenci n y con m s apoyo para el ciudadano
9222181 respeto al ex presidente fox le tengo gratitud y respeto las decisiones del partido
9222182 no coincido con muchos de sus posicionamientos pero simple y sencillamente observo como observan muchos panistas
9222183 cada cual tiene que responder el pan tiene una gran tarea que va m s all de la vida personal de cada uno
9222184 todos tenemos que volver a la escuela nadie puede decir que est suficientemente graduado de la escuela
9222185 con el senador beltrones y con todas las fuerzas pol ticas hay que hacer acuerdos con los prop sitos claros de transformar el pa s para la mayor a de los mexicanos
9222186 los acuerdos requieren voluntad calidad y transparencia nadie con miedos puede construir acuerdos
9222187 pues me gustar a encargarle que haga la parte que le corresponde y que colabore para allanar ciertos caminos sobre todo que le d a cada cual la fortaleza que requiere
9222188 la presidencia no es asunto de dios es de los electores la verdad es que estoy tan ocupada en la agenda educativa ya he vivido una campa a la hice con orgullo fue la m s dif cil de la historia y con eso es suficiente
9222189 con esa campa a ha sido suficiente en mi vida
9222190 para una mujer nunca nada ha sido f cil y creo en que m xico todav a falta vencer muchos obst culos porque se reconozcan y particularmente aqu llos que no quisieron aceptarlo

9222220 i came to cameron this morning to offer prayers with the people for deliverance from all storms and destructive weather i did that because i think first things first before we think of evacuation and all kinds of physical and material things we need to spend some time in prayer and turn our minds to spiritual things
9222221 the good lord will provide so were just waiting and see what happens
9222222 you got to pray people who dont pray dont know thats the first thing you do when your feet hit the ground
9222223 the fourth of july was really hard fathers day was hard
9222224 my daughter had a birthday and we had the biggest party i could possibly put together to try to make it a special day but we still had a time where she and i had to go in the room and have a cry
9222225 but may i suggest you reserve 30 or so of the remaining places for the biggest selling album of each year since 1977 while this may mean youll be forced to grudgingly purchase albums by the likes of garth brooks it will save you alot of grief from customers not quite accustomed to the off key caterwauling of the mars volta

9222227 its always been the same format its the casual amateur dj night its become such a feature of the landscape that it has almost replaced bands
9222228 why do you pay them any mind why do you even care
9222229 you like dont even have to do anything all you have to do is get some cds or a computer and just play anything
9222230 carrying around a device powered by a delicate spinning drive does seem like a recipe for disaster
9222231 well what if you wanna listen to a specific song and you dont have it on your small mp3 player wouldnt you find that to be a bit annoying
9222232 no not really besides there are plenty of times when i wanna hear a song and dont have it readily available im used to that its not the end of the world you know
9222233 i cant believe we went to war against the nazis for the sake of you people
9222234 your band made me smile for the first time since q and not u broke up

9222239 it was hard for me to decide on the general mood i wanted to convey i also had some difficulty in deciding the order of the last few songs i felt like the mix cd turned into lost in translation part ii thus i tried hard to avoid duplicating an oeuvre that more or less already exists
9222240 should i put fugazi on this mix im being so neurotic about impressing him

9222245 we have a good plan in place and are moving people and resources to assist the people of the arkansas department of emergency management and the sebastian county office of emergency management in getting ready to facilitate those displaced by the hurricane
9222246 we have a pretty good handle on resources at the outset
9222247 so we are not currently in need of particular donations of anything that may change however depending on how serious the storm is and how long the people have to stay here
9222248 dont drink dont smoke a lot dont get shitfaced and do not lick a girl out
9222249 its not natural to stay in a place thats under sea level when theres a reasonable chance of it flooding out

9222252 yes sir i am sure it seems that way it certainly catches you off guard and makes you think twice
9222253 well god i could sit here and say absolutly nothing about what i believe about this subject or i could kindly and in a loving christ like way let this man know how i feel about being selfless
9222254 well if you give to charity or help the poor you do it for yourself you may be doing a good deed but you are doing it to give yourself a good feeling inside
9222255 well sir i definatly repect and understand your statement but i dont think i agree

9222266 that it when life begins shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
9222267 misrepresented both the writings of st augustine and the settled doctrine of the catholic church in an attempt to justify uncertainty about when human life begins and thus to defend a right to abortion
9222268 that in an age that prides itself on scientific knowledge there are those whose agenda drives them to invoke misinformed theology to cast doubt on some of the most basic biological truths
9222269 in such a politicized environment of self serving skepticism and slogans about choice the church must tirelessly proclaim the truth about the dignity of the human person from conception to natural death this is all the more urgent when innocent human life is threatened as it is by abortion as well as embryonic stem cell research and euthanasia
9222270 on behalf of the 650 000 catholics of this archdiocese i wish to reinforce what cardinal rigali bishop lori of bridgeport conn and archbishop chaput of denver have said about speaker pelosis misinterpretation on the question of when life begins
9222271 the church has taught for centuries that life begins at conception and there is no room for misrepresentation of that teaching in addition modern medical techniques have been able to confirm what the church has already known
9222272 surely there may be some catholic politicians who will take a different interpretation of this church doctrine during the coming election campaign but speaker pelosis remarks underscore once again the need for catholics and especially catholic politicians to form their consciences according to the moral truths taught by the catholic church
9222273 be providing leadership in a civilized democracy worthy of the name
9222274 rectify your errant claims and apologize for misrepresenting the churchs doctrine and misleading fellow catholics
9222275 we wish you would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
9222276 your subsequent remarks mangle catholic church doctrine regarding the inherent sanctity and dignity of human life therefore we are compelled to refute your error
9222277 you can cross chris rays name off the list he will not be a september callup
9222278 andy chris ray and myself we all mutually agree theres no purpose of him being active in september hes done a great job hes going to complete his program with class a aberdeen hes going to have a normal winter of rest come to spring training and then go from there theres no purpose of him rejoining us in september theres nothing to be gained from that

9222282 the voters of the county sent a clear message that they are very comfortable with john hanlin as our next sheriff
9222283 he had a lot ground to make up and i would have thought i would have seen him at all of the summer festivals and other events but i didnt
9222284 that made me wonder whether he was thinking of dropping out
9222285 while i admire this county i love my family and realize that i want to spend the next few years supporting them and making up for the many days and nights of family time that i missed while i was in law enforcement
9222286 he ran a good clean campaign as did dave lee i think that speaks volumes about all three of us
9222287 i think hes done a heck of a job as interim sheriff
9222288 however this county cannot afford financially emotionally or from a time perspective to hold a contentious election for sheriff
9222289 today we begin to band together as a community united behind our sheriffs office

9222329 judging by these surveillance photos you should get that thing on your ass looked at
9222330 spring is finally here spring when a young mans fancy turns to thoughts of love and eliot spitzer turns to the yellow pages also the fifth anniversary of the iraq war how romantic once again they forgot to greet us with flowers traditionally this is the wood anniversary five which is fitting cause thats what dick cheney gets when he thinks of war the war is going into its sixth year with no end in sight the economy of course is tanking but what is america freaking out about right now that apparently barack obama went to a church and heard his pastor criticize america and just sat there everybody knows when you hear something your pastor says that you dont agree with you get up there and you punch him in the f face and you beat him with the cross not only that this reverend wright apparently he officiated when obama got married wait til they find out the wedding band was the wu tang clan the thing is republicans of course dont allow dangerous religious freaks to advise their campaigns they nominate them of course obama had to answer this did you watch his speech he hit all the notes he said racism is real for black people he said white resentment is real for white people but at the end of the day why cant we all come together with the shared knowledge that asians cant drive the good news is on youtube the obama speech now is getting watched more than the clips of the pastor the bad news is that its still far behind the footage of spitzers hooker on girls gone wild this chick is everywhere i swear to god she won american idol the last person to get this famous for f some idiot was kevin federline new yorks new governor david paterson he made history this week hes black hes blind and hes hornier than the last guy he hadnt taken his hand off the bible when they swore him in before he admitted to having multiple affairs see this is what women dont get about the male sex drive he was blind and he still wanted to see other people and its not easy having an affair when youre blind he used to come home with lipstick on his shoes his wife was cheating too did you know that i would have loved to see that confrontation honey i may be blind but im not blind and now the new york post says that eliot spitzer is in therapy for sex addiction im not sure he really understands the process today he requested an analyst with really big tits
9222331 winter officially ended this week so thats good news yeah today al gore blamed the end of winter on global warming sunday of course is easter another big problem for barack obama this easter sunday wheres he gonna go to church easter of course is the time we celebrate miracles see we dont have miracles like easter and the resurrection and the parting of the red sea anymore you know what im saying like today our idea of a miracle is gas under 3 50 a gallon boy there is nothing but disasters in the news its unbelievable floods in the midwest fires in texas the democratic party its just unbelievable to give you an idea how bad the democrats are doing in a stunning reversal john mccain now 10 ahead of hillary clinton and 7 ahead of barack obama and this is after iraq a recession and no health care imagine how far ahead hed be if the republicans had actually done something this week john mccain received a warm welcome in israel he was in israel you know he is hugely popular in israel ever since he stood with the jewish people against the pharaoh theyve never forgotten president bushs approval rating has reached a record low 31 wow his popularity is so low now on his facebook page he only has imaginary friends the cover of time magazine asked the question what did hillary do as first lady well we know what she didnt do bill and osama bin laden has released another anti american speech and out of force of habit barack obama denounced the remarks and said he wasnt even in the room at the time the statements were being made anyway critics are pouring over osama bin ladens latest audio tape simon called it pretentious paula said it was not his best work and randy said dog its just not working for me according to a new study by the university of british columbia and harvard money can buy happiness but only if you spend the money on someone else to which former governor eliot spitzer said see according to the new york post eliot spitzer has entered therapy for his sex addiction he has sex addiction hes not horny a sex addiction see i dont know if its gonna work when the therapist told him it was 300 bucks an hour he said what can i get for an extra 50 have you heard about this playgirl magazine made an offer to eliot spitzer to appear naked in the magazine isnt that unbelievable i tell you you know who really wants to see that spread former new jersey governor jim mcgreevey in tibet the rumor is the dalai lama might be stepping down yeah it turns out he was client number 11
9222332 a new cnn poll just came out about the campaign interesting results a new study shows that wine drinkers prefer hillary clinton to the other candidates yeah after hearing this bill clinton asked how much wine have they had i guess this is good news former new york governor eliot spitzer has reportedly entered therapy for a sex addiction spitzer said his therapy is going well and that his therapist has a fantastic rack in new jersey today there were dangerous winds with gusts up to 50 miles an hour the winds were so strong that they blew former governor mcgreevey off his chauffeur well of course this sunday is easter of course easter is that very very holy day when christians around the world honor a 2 000 year old jewish man who is not larry king a big insurance company just announced they will give 10 million to anyone who can invent a car that gets 100 miles per gallon meanwhile exxon says theyll give 11 million to anyone who kills that guy
9222333 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them
9222334 with that in mind i believe that the best candidate for philadelphia is the one who has not only ideas but the skills to implement them is willing to embrace change while also working in collaboration with us at the local level is experienced and willing to extend a helping hand and possesses both good judgment and a profound sense of social justice based on those criteria ive made my decision on which candidate i support i have endorsed senator hillary clinton hillary clinton has an impressive 35 year record of fighting on behalf of working families and children fighting for universal health care for every american and has a comprehensive plan to end the war in iraq and restore our standing around the world but most importantly she has a strong commitment to revitalizing our urban centers and i believe that under her leadership our american cities will rise again the hillary clinton agenda for revitalizing philadelphia and other major metropolitan areas is called leave no city behind and it creates a vital partnership between our efforts here in philadelphia and the efforts of the federal government
9222335 pledging to work her heart out if elected president democratic candidate u
9222336 we need to send someone who can be commander in chief and president
9222337 hillary clinton evoked themes of sisterhood and motherhood while addressing women voters in blue bell today and reminded them shed be a strong commander in chief and a fighter for universal health care
9222338 we have seen changes that are unimaginable for our mothers and grandmothers
9222339 there were colleges i couldnt go to scholarships i couldnt apply for
9222340 there must be a republican gremlin in the sound system
9222341 this is an issue of equality and justice this is a family issue
9222342 to solve the current crisis hillary clinton believes we need sorely missed proactive policies that ask what is best for families on main street
9222343 even village elders do not remember anything remotely similar to the tragedy that has unfolded here
9222344 the main road of madhepura town fell in the kosis course in the 1942 floods

9222416 jamie joseph has added a different look to the game this year and we trying to play with a lot of width which is different to how we have played in the past
9222417 i have worked really hard on my work rate and i have been trying to get involved in matches more because we are looking to play wide all of the time it allows me to do that more than i have been able to
9222418 we had a look at them before the game and came out with a plan to get our forwards involved early and stop their loose forwards from getting their hands on the ball
9222419 we were able to do that successfully and the gaps opened once they got tired
9222420 jamie and the guys work us pretty hard but you see that it is generating the results for us at the moment
9222421 it has made a big difference in all of the matches that weve played this season and has allowed us to impose ourselves on other sides as they tire
9222422 obviously i was pleased to score those tries but with the fantastic conditions and the cohesive team that we have it allows me to get into try scoring positions
9222423 the key for us now is to remain focused and ensure that we take each match as it comes and prepare as we have for the matches to date

9222483 nous avons tenu le choc pendant 65 70 minutes en produisant un beau football comme lors des trois premi res rencontres de la saison et ensuite nous avons laiss faire nos adversaires je regrette des occasions perdues en premi re p riode qui auraient pu nous permettre de tuer le match il faut travailler ce probl me maintenant apr s les quatre premi res journ es de la saison jesp rais 4 ou 5 points il nous en manque donc un mais cette unit manquante est largement compens e par la qualit de jeu que nous avons d velopp l quipe a le niveau de la ligue 1 et je pense quelle le prouvera encore plus apr s 8 journ es elle doit parfaire dabord son apprentissage mais cela va venir
9222484 l galisation nous fait mal et le second but manceau juste avant la mi temps encore plus mal si on a essay de revenir en deuxi me mi temps cest de fa on d sordonn e et logiquement on sest fait aspirer par une quipe bien organis e dans les vestiaires ce nest pas aux joueurs mais aux hommes que je me suis adress il faut que chacun fasse sa propre analyse je continue croire en cette quipe on manque dune certaine forme dhumilit et de rigueur
9222485 je suis heureux je f licite mes joueurs qui ont effectu un bon mois dao t jai un staff extraordinaire et des joueurs qui ont envie dexister le championnat va tre long plut t que notre classement je ne veux donc retenir que les neuf points ce soir nous avons commenc un peu mollement nous avons surtout eu la chance de ne pas trop douter en galisant dans la foul e le deuxi me but dans le temps additionnel nous a fait du bien par la suite nous tions toujours la merci dun contre ou dun coup de pied arr t puisque le troisi me ne venait pas tant que nous navions pas fait le break il fallait se m fier personnellement javais d j gagn nantes avec le cfa bon maintenant cest une premi re en ligue 1
9222486 nous avons fait un match plein deux poteaux un penalty rat pas de situations de but je ne vais pas faire la fine bouche m me sil nous a manqu un peu de clairvoyance et de lucidit pour nous mettre labri plus t t on a connu deux petits coups de moins bien apr s l chec de lo c r my sur penalty puis apr s notre ouverture du score l quipe est jeune et contrairement aux id es re ues il est toujours plus difficile de jouer dix adversaires quune quipe au complet

9222504 i cannot reconcile the invasion of georgia by russia and the enormous destruction it has wrought on average georgians with the continuation of full funding for our programs in russia at this time
9222505 such a conference would also send a strong message of support to the georgian people and their government and would demonstrate to the putin regime in moscow that we have no intention of abandoning georgia or other countries in the region to russias imperialist aggression and coercion

9222681 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping out of the hands of criminals
9222682 since the supreme court issued its opinion on the meaning of the second amendment the debate over
9222683 america wants sensible restrictions on the easy access to dangerous weapons and sen obama clearly recognized that last night

9222732 i have had numerous physical health problems since i was six weeks old
9222733 they didnt know what to do with me because no matter what all of the books said i didnt fit the protocol it seemed that all doctors could do was give me medicine for my symptoms instead of solving the problems

9222754 el ministro cort zar amenaza p blicamente con caducar los contratos de los operadores en caso de que los incumplimientos de contin en y si bien nosotros compartimos plenamente el llamado del ministro desconfiamos de sus intenciones porque sto debi exigirse hace mucho tiempo
9222755 por qu no lo hizo antes ministro por qu no se han exigido las obligaciones de gesti n de flota o la de contar con filtros para la contaminaci n o la de construir terminales y mantener los buses en buen estado por qu ahora justo cuando el d ficit se dispara y todo parece descontrolado es que intenta estas maniobras medi ticas para culpar a los operadores
9222756 si de exigencias se trata el que deber a tener 30 d as para arreglar el transantiago es el ministro cort zar y su gobierno que no ha sido capaz de bajar el d ficit y hacer andar este sistema desastroso
9222757 el que no tiene excusas es el ministro que siempre promete y promete pero a la hora de cumplir trata de escudarse en la responsabilidad de otros
9222758 al que deber amos caducar es al ministro cort zar que m s que ofrecernos soluciones para el transantiago nos ha llenado de excusas y seguimos donde mismo con un sistema fracasado caro y que no le sirve a la gente
9222759 el transantiago es una pol tica p blica ntegramente dise ada e implementada desde el estado particularmente por los gobiernos del presidente ricardo lagos y la presidenta michelle bachelet venir aqu a lavarse las manos a tender una cortina de humo para desviar la atenci n es imprudente e injustificado

9222769 this deterioration of confidence is a sign that leaders arent meeting the needs of the organization
9222770 every business leader needs to take note of this if they want to grow their organization
9222771 great leadership doesnt happen by accident organizations need to start listening to their leaders and make the right development investments if they want different results than theyre getting now
9222772 the message isnt clear if ceos think these are the traits they need in the next five years but leaders dont think these are respected
9222773 leaders are focused on the bottom line because that is the message they are hearing loud and clear

9222786 now he was throwing easily but he was in good spirits said riley in his day after remarks following a 36 28 loss at stanford in the season opener
9222787 everything we got from the doctor said he should work on range of motion and throw then just see how it goes
9222788 we wont hurry him and i dont anticipate him playing this week
9222789 its just what we knew said riley of the game which osu basically gave away with three turnovers and another error that led to a safety
9222790 but one thing after it was all said and done there was a lot of good learning to be done thats what we have to do with it
9222791 you cant do that very often and expect to win he said we already know that its always been our m o stopping the run those are the things penalties fumbles run defense that hit you right between the eyes but there was a ton of good football and a lot of good defense
9222792 it will be good to have al back said riley afalava had to sit game 1 because of his off season dui
9222793 played very well and he can even make some more throws he had some stuff hes like to have back the pick to bo mcnally but in terms of playing the game that was right in front of him he did a nice job
9222794 i dont think weve seen everything hes got said riley
9222795 theres plenty of football there for both of them said riley
9222796 hes a big fast back and he kept his pads down said the coach
9222797 we didnt wrap up and bounced off his pads basically thats what happened we got misaligned once and he cut out on us another time i think we had three guys hit him and then our corner tim clark over ran the play on the backside
9222798 we dont want to live like that with 54 passes in a game said riley
9222799 thats really not our style i dont think thats where were at our best
9222800 bodybag game because one school was just going for the paycheck osu gets between 1
9222801 we appreciate the school and the program that were playing as we did when we went to lsu said riley
9222802 the woodbury police are excited because they got something thats more serious than a cat up a tree
9222803 this is a very unique case and frankly i dont know the ramifications of anything yet
9222804 were just always looking out the windows the whole neighborhood in general is feeling the same way
9222805 that to me is ridiculous i dont understand how that can happen
9222806 hes going to have to bang a little bit to get in at me and hopefully ill be able to wake up by then
9222807 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
9222808 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
9222809 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
9222810 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
9222811 the evidence i received busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
9222812 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
9222813 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
9222814 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
9222815 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
9222816 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
9222817 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about
9222818 if it wasnt for his friend and the grace of god thatd be it

9222840 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change

9222855 we really enjoyed meeting doug he understood what we wanted we went to three other weddings around the time of ours i wish we were able to recommend music on the move all i can say is that people seemed to have much more fun at our reception a fun party at our wedding was the most important part to me well besides our vows dara really knew how to talk to my dad she gave him some really great ideas for the toast and made him feel special doug mcd a great party i just loved doug and kevin guitar player sitting on the steps singing stairway to heaven i was deeply moved and will never forget it the moment was priceless
9222856 you did an awesome job with the timing and organizing of our wedding day our introductions of the wedding party and the bride and groom were unbelievable my daddy daughter dance with my personal message in it was incredible absolutely incredible the whole organization of our wedding was very well done music on the move did an outstanding job giving us the perfect introduction and beginning of the rest of our lives
9222857 thank you seems so insufficient a word for all that you did for the kids to create a beautiful special occasion i personally want to thank you for sharing your wonderful talent you are a great mc and made ryan and sarah stever feel so special as well as their families i know hours of work went into all the special moments that happened you helped to make memories for a lifetime so from the bottom of my heart thank you thank you thank you youre wonderful

9222859 hey guess what i have a microphone and you dont im related to the band and you are a douche bag
9222860 i have seen my various nieces and nephews go through primary school and i have seen the difference that a poor teacher makes
9222861 it isnt like secondary like having a science teacher you cant get on with in a primary school it can turn a child off learning
9222862 i never have much patience with schools that argue they have a poor cohort or year group if it is going to be more difficult head teachers have to plan and put in additional things additional strategies different ways of dealing with it it is no good saying a school is going to be great in five years time
9222863 we expect schools to be on top of the quality of teaching
9222864 i think there is still too much satisfactory teaching when you look at the attainment gap between the haves and have nots you are not going to get real success in those really difficult areas with satisfactory teaching it wasnt my phrase but satisfactory is not good enough especially in poor areas
9222865 i dont want to underplay the link between poverty and underachievement but schools cannot languish on 11 per cent or 15 per cent of pupils achieving five good gcses these schools do in the end have to perform well they have to deliver the goods we can get far more children through than are currently getting five a to cs that has to be the goal whatever the intake
9222866 parents should not be putting up with that they should be putting pressure on the school pushing it
9222867 they need to use their parent governors better if they are not getting any response they should go to the local authority

9222899 quando ele completou 60 anos houve a publica o esbo o de figura com um poema do carlos drummond de andrade nos 70 anos teve o livro dentro do texto dentro da vida nos 80 foi a vez de pensamento e milit ncia agora nos 90 ele pediu que n o fizessem nada
9222900 anda bastante discreta at ele n o gosta nada que se ocupem dele e parece que houve uma esp cie de acordo t cito para respeitar a vontade
9222901 com este esp rito talvez obsoleto de velho intelectual participante como se dizia naquele tempo que aqui estou para agradecer de cora o esta desvanecedora homenagem
9222902 mas o ocidente se deu conta de que a r ssia mudou
9222903 o que foi visto o desejo da r ssia de ser levada seriamente em considera o como uma pot ncia mundial e sua rea o ao que considera que uma invas o do ocidente em sua esfera de influ ncia a ex uni o sovi tica
9222904 n o h uma divis o ideol gica entre blocos como ocorreu ent o
9222905 assim acho que um pouco exagerado cham la de guerra fria
9222906 cada lado faz algo que alega necessitar para consolidar sua pr pria seguran a e depois o outro lado sente que sua seguran a est sendo amea ada e que precisa dizer ou fazer algo
9222907 n o vejo uma nova corrida armamentista a r ssia n o tem os recursos apesar da recupera o registrada a partir de meados dos 90 n o tem o dinheiro para se rearmar
9222908 a r ssia definiu precisamente a sua esfera de influ ncia a rea onde quer manter uma influ ncia algo que n o poderia ter feito nos anos 90 ap s o colapso da uni o sovi tica agora gra as recupera o de sua economia de seu poder governamental capaz de faz lo
9222909 havia chegado o momento para enfrentar o que considera uma penetra o
9222910 o risco de escalada militar envolvendo o ocidente realmente baixo neste momento porque nem a r ssia nem o ocidente querem chegar a essa situa o
9222911 okay why did i fail what was wrong let me try to do something else let me go forward with it
9222912 this is a little more than what we had in mind in such a short time

9222922 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9222923 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9222924 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9222925 foi um belo gol a gente precisava desse 1 a 0 pois n o est vamos bem estamos errando muito passes temos que melhorar no segundo tempo
9222926 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9222927 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9222928 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9222929 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9222930 estamos marcando bem e at agora matando eles no contra ataque mas o jogo segue perigoso
9222931 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9222932 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9222933 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9222934 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9222935 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9222936 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9222937 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9222938 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9222939 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9222940 who are open to doing something on the production side
9222941 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9222942 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9222943 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9222944 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9222945 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9222946 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9222947 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9222948 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9222949 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9222950 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9222951 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9222952 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9222953 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9222954 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9222955 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9222956 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9222957 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9222958 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9222959 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9222960 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9222961 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9222962 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9222963 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9222964 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9222965 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9222966 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9222967 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9222968 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9222969 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9222970 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9222971 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9222972 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9222973 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9222974 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9222975 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9222976 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9222977 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9222978 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9222979 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9222980 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9222981 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9222982 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

9222985 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9222986 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9222987 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9222988 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9222989 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9222990 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9222991 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9222992 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant

9223008 ich bin w tend oder besser gesagt sauer auf mich
9223009 in der letzten session ist mir in der schnellsten stelle einmal das hinterrad weggerutscht diese runde konnte ich abschreiben in den letzten beiden runden wo ich die zeit noch h tte verbessern k nnen habe ich selbst in der letzten kurve je einen fehler gemacht aber trotzdem au er barbera und simoncelli die in einer anderen klasse zu fahren scheinen sind alle ganz knapp beisammen
9223010 f r morgen liegt viel drin ich werde sicher in dieser gruppe mithalten k nnen
9223011 neu habe ich am hinterrad drei sensoren die wie bei den motogp bikes die temperatur des hinterreifen aufzeichnen
9223012 es ist extrem die reifen werden bis 112 grad hei wenn das hinterrad durchdreht da sind wir am probieren denn wir haben nat rlich noch keine referenzwerte aber damit sollte man mit mehr erfahrung in der lage sein den optimalen gummi f r die jeweilige au en und asphalttemperatur zu finden
9223013 ich bin nicht wirklich zufrieden ich h tte besser sein k nnen als platz f nf
9223014 offensichtlich habe ich eine gute runde im q2 hingelegt aber habe das leider im q3 nicht hinbekommen das ist sehr frustrierend

9223108 i am very happy about my team and my car because we did a lot of work yesterday to find a good set up and this morning the car was very fast
9223109 the car was great in qualifying but you not only need a good car you need to make sure you dont make a mistake it wasnt simple to ensure you didnt make an error in each of your one lap shootouts
9223110 there is a lot pressure to make sure you get it right the 15 minutes qualifying session is just the start then the battle begins
9223111 i am really happy for myself and sevilla fc because the car was strong and i did a good job
9223112 we have to wait and see tomorrow in the races and it is important to start with a good result
9223113 i think the qualifying format for superleague formula is unbelievable
9223114 it is really hard to find a clear lap in other categories but here you can really show what the car can do
9223115 i hope the car is strong tomorrow but we havent tried it yet on full tanks so it will be interesting to see how the car will react
9223116 we were struggling a bit this morning but we improved quite a lot as the day continued hopefully we can keep moving forward to aim to make the final shoot out next time
9223117 it was very competitive out there with a lot of extremely experienced drivers so i am happy to be third
9223118 im definitely delighted to be involved in the championship and weve seen a clear sign that this is going to be a big success for everyone
9223119 the format for qualifying is really exciting for both the drivers and the spectators

9223121 you are assuming that the speed of the plane is measured by the wheels and there is nothing that says that
9223122 can a plane that is moving forward at take off speed take off
9223123 can a conveyor belt keep a plane from achieving take off speed
9223124 can a plane that is moving forward at take off speed take off
9223125 can a conveyor belt keep a plane from achieving take off speed
9223126 can this conveyor prevent the plane from reaching takeoff speed
9223127 can a plane that is moving forward at take off speed take off
9223128 can a conveyor belt keep a plane from achieving take off speed

9223308 apart from the safety issues which are huge this idea is to paraphrase ralph nader unsafe at any download speed the presence of the internet connected computer in the car raises the specter of an even more unpleasant driving experience than the one were currently in in which people on those same phones tend to forget theyre in a public space with legal rules and expected norms of behavior and fail to signal take longer to pull away at lights and generally annoy the drivers who are gasp actually driving drivers are already in their own private cocoons that they would be checking their
9223309 weve already seen fatalities from people looking at their laptops while driving it seems absolutely surprising that chrysler would open the door for a full blown distraction like internet access
9223310 people are connected in their lives everywhere today theyre connected at home theyre connected at the office theyre connected at starbucks when they go for a cup of coffee

9223314 i can picture two teenagers in the front and the passenger pulls up a youtube video
9223315 each dish has brought back memories of great and small occasions of festivals of the emotions of those times and of the sayings invariably said
9223316 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9223317 to just have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9223318 i demand an immediate apology from michael moore to the people of south louisiana for his offensive and inappropriate comments
9223319 people in louisiana regardless of political affiliation are making plans to leave to protect their families from this serious storm and the god i know would not share michael moores glee for our plight

9223322 i can be a tad difficult to work for im loud pushy and while i used to think we paid well i am no longer sure
9223323 surely this is not a work of art but a blashphemy and a disgusting piece of trash that upsets many people

9223326 barack obama has proposed job killing tax increases while our economy is already hurting and his campaign launched dismissive political attacks against governor palins executive state house and small town experience despite his own lack of either americans know thats more of the same bad judgment from barack obama and it proves hes just not ready to lead
9223327 the american workforce continues to be the marvel of the world
9223328 days after john mccain declared that the fundamentals of the economy are strong president bush used his labor day radio address to say that our economy is beginning to improve but for the americans whove seen their jobs disappear their personal incomes plunge their home values plummet and gas prices skyrocket nothing could be further from the truth when it comes to being out of touch with what middle class americans are going through george bush and john mccain are two of a kind no wonder theyre meeting in the twin cities this week
9223329 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
9223330 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
9223331 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
9223332 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can
9223333 its looking more likely than it was before these meetings
9223334 he said that he doubted that there was any common ground

9223341 whats troubling is that even if it was the israelis it happened in damascus in a safe area meters from the office of intelligence chief assef shawkat
9223342 the americans are making up stories about me and hold me responsible for a lot of attacks against them that happened around the world
9223343 sometimes they think of me as if i have the key to the universe it is difficult for them to understand that i am part of an institution that patiently plans and designs its moves
9223344 our aim is for every single school to welcome children from all backgrounds it is a simple goal strongly supported by the public educationalists and students
9223345 there are those who attend church in order that their children qualify for admission to a particular school and never set foot in the church again after the children have been accepted
9223346 all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9223347 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9223348 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children the bottom line is that faith schools are successful thriving popular and here to stay
9223349 it is down to locally accountable councils and communities themselves not some campaign group to decide what sort of schools they should have
9223350 given the dangers of segregation and the importance of community cohesion we need schools that welcome all and are committed to non discrimination

9223470 what kind of question is that of course cold exists have you never been cold
9223471 in fact sir cold does not exist according to the laws of physics what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat absolute zero is the total absence of heat but cold does not exist as such what we have done is create a term to describe how we feel if we dont have body heat or we are not hot
9223472 again youre wrong sir darkness is in reality the absence of light we can study light but not darkness how can you know how dark a certain space is you measure the amount of light present isnt this correct darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present
9223473 of course as i have already said we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
9223474 evil does not exist sir or at least it does not exist unto itself evil is simply the absence of god it is just like darkness and cold a word that man has created to describe the absence of god god did not create evil evil is not like faith or love that exist just as does light and heat evil is the result of what happens when man does not have gods love present in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light

9223675 horrified to find sick and wounded soldiers supposedly long since removed still languishing all over the area
9223676 left in a school house in care of a steward without supplies found him making every effort to keep them comfortable
9223677 you no doubt think your ladies in washington are doing a great work but i can assure you if they were here they would find the stern reality of want privation and extreme suffering
9223678 again we went to smoketown hoping to find them in a more comfortable condition than when we were last there but how sadly were we disappointed how i wish i could introduce you and the washington commission to smoketown hospital in the midst of this driving snow storm
9223679 you could have seen the poor fellows huddled together with their pallets of straw on the ground their tents with no stoves those who were able to creep out of their tents were crouched over fires built in the woods their heads covered with snow
9223680 its always been that way the kids and i do everything ourselves we dont feel hardly done by its just the way it is
9223681 it was a friday morning and mark was supposed to travel to liverpool for an away game and i was throwing up in the bathroom sick as a dog with a fever
9223682 we didnt have any friends we had no one here who i felt safe to leave julian with so i could just lie in bed we just carried on off he went
9223683 it will come to an end one day which makes you appreciate it a lot more
9223684 its always been that way the kids and i do everything ourselves we dont feel hardly done by its just the way it is
9223685 it was a friday morning and mark was supposed to travel to liverpool for an away game and i was throwing up in the bathroom sick as a dog with a fever
9223686 we didnt have any friends we had no one here who i felt safe to leave julian with so i could just lie in bed we just carried on off he went
9223687 it will come to an end one day which makes you appreciate it a lot more
9223688 but we have come to the conclusion that we need more time to refine the service to ensure a more focused gaming entertainment experience than what it is today
9223689 a pesar de las circunstancias hicimos una crono muy aceptable
9223690 todo ha estado dentro de la normalidad salvo con liquigas que gan con los dem s hemos estado en diferencias de 13 segundos para abajo que me parecen muy aceptables lo que da un poco de rabia es que ezequiel mosquera se cortase un poco en la llegada por falta de entendimiento y perdiese 3 segundos con respecto a sus compa eros
9223691 no tiene mayor trascendencia ni deportiva ni an micamente hay que entender que viene de 15 d as de entrenarse en altitud y l que de por s es un corredor di sel es normal que se encuentre falto de chispa
9223692 hemos tenido un cambio de patrocinador y esto nos ha obligado a atender tambi n a otras cuestiones de car cter promocional que sumado al viaje no nos ha permitido entrenar de la mejor manera durante varios d as pero la vuelta no ha hecho m s que empezar y cuando llegue el terreno de ezequiel va a estar ah con los mejores
9223693 es una especialidad que no hemos tenido ocasi n de entrenar a nivel personal las sensaciones han sido muy buenas y casi no he tenido que llegar al m ximo esfuerzo durante la contrarreloj la vuelta acaba de empezar y creo que se aclarar mucho en las dos primeras semanas yo espero meterme en carrera ayudar al equipo y encontrar mis oportunidad
9223694 no estoy descontento con el desarrollo de la crono se pod a haber hecho mejor pero tambi n es cierto que es una especialidad que no hab amos disputado en toda la temporada y no fuimos muy compenetrados personalmente me he encontrado bien cada d a voy mejor y conf o en poder hacer algo bonito no puedo decir exactamente lo que en principio estoy m s metalizado para buscar el triunfo de etapas que para la general pero ser cuesti n de ir cada a d a y ver como se desarrolla la vuelta
9223695 this is the one major outlet that i have to represent myself everyone can see it so i think ill post those pictures of the time i forgot half my clothes and of my drunken stupors im pretty proud of those then ill drop the f bomb like its hiroshima
9223696 im enjoying behaving in whatever ways i please i dont appreciate that youre disrupting my immorality so i choose to make you look like the bad guy you square
9223697 if you can get universal health care or something close to it in however imperfect then the country will never be the same again it will be something that is an untouchable and it will make people just understand once again that government can do things to make the society fairer safer
9223698 la protecci n a ellos por parte del estado no lo criticamos el problema es que no se da igual trato al resto de los barineses que a cada hora est n a merced de la delincuencia hay una discriminaci n
9223699 eso es insuficiente y si se a ade que un porcentaje protege a una parcialidad la capacidad de respuesta ante la inseguridad se ve disminuida

9223711 hurricane gustav has become a very dangerous category 4 hurricane wind rain and waves will increase significantly through monday with the worst conditions arriving along the louisiana coast by monday night
9223712 i wish i could tell the future because i am not really comfortable leaving anyways and the fact i dont want to loose my house or let anything happen to it
9223713 if i leave here tomorrow would you still remember me
9223714 breese stevens has always had first class turf and playing conditions for soccer
9223715 there are just under 100 soccer games played here every year
9223716 by making this investment in this facility well keep it alive for another half century and it gives us the opportunity to be competitive again as an athletic facility
9223717 it really gives new life to a classic field with a distinctive urban feel almost like a fenway park or a wrigley field
9223718 athletes like it because of the conditions on the field theres a good athletic turf blend and the ball goes where its intended to go but i think kids also like to play in a place that has a good historic feel you know id like to play a game here myself
9223719 he told each of the governors that federal officials were monitoring hurricane gustav very closely
9223720 president bush pledged the full support of the federal government
9223721 ice cream is always a comfort food were definitely in a good position but a lot of smaller mom and pops are closing
9223722 the whole industry is in flux and theres a shortage of manufacturing capacity
9223723 theres a fair amount of demand for the services we provide
9223724 if youre talking about this economy this fits this economy
9223725 mom can throw out a buck and satisfy four kids
9223726 for us to be a regional manufacturer and be distributed across the u s has allowed us to be competitive in the industry
9223727 with his background and ability to deal with large companies hes really helped us to be able to move on to the next level
9223728 a group of minds is better than any one mind
9223729 war is just a racket a racket is best described i believe as something that is not what it seems to the majority of people only a small inside group knows what it is about it is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the masses
9223730 i spent 33 years and 4 months in active service as a member of our countrys most agile military force the marine corps i served in all commissioned ranks from second lieutenant to major general and during that period i spent most of my time being a high class muscle man for big business for wall street and for the bankers in short i was a racketeer for capitalism
9223731 a racket is best described as something that is not what it seems to the majority of people only a small inside group knows what it is about it is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the masses
9223732 were mad as hell and we wont take it anymore
9223733 this is prompted by the fact that one in four children in british columbia is either overweight or obese
9223734 we actually know that children who are healthy actually learn better
9223735 we really hope the physical break is about how the teachers shape their classes
9223736 weve created a series of guidelines that actually outline the types of products that can be in a vending machine
9223737 it doesnt mean that a student couldnt have pizza its just a matter of whats on that pizza
9223738 absolutely teachers are behind that but that revenue was funding sports teams special events and in some cases text books and basic supplies
9223739 you cant add p e in schools without adding space for that and resources for that
9223740 we dont have the gym space in vancouver it rains a lot and you cant have kids out there on the field in the pouring rain and in many parts of the province its very cold in the winter
9223741 fundamentally you need to have classrooms that are going to be as effective as possible
9223742 we continue to struggle to convince the government to address resources there
9223743 im a black republican but i support obama its historic you know in this situation you have to put aside party lines and be a good black woman
9223744 i think at this point they still expect lawrence tynes to be healthy and be able to kick this year
9223745 but i dont think anybody has a timetable on that
9223746 its not like we have a choice in seattle its either comcast qwest or verizon
9223747 luego del triple crimen el agenciero descubri que el auto estaba a nombre de forza y quiso sac rselo de encima era una papa caliente para l
9223748 statistics are like bikinis what they show is important but what they hide is essential
9223749 estamos convocando una reuni n de ciudadanos una concentraci n en la plaza bri n de chaca to en el este de caracas y es que desde ese sitio le vamos a decir a los venezolanos con claridad qu es lo que quiere el gobierno con las 26 leyes habilitantes
9223750 le dijimos a venezuela que disfrazaron la reforma de ley habilitante que quieren retar a los ciudadanos quieren colocarnos en el camino de la abstenci n de la confrontaci n y la polarizaci n
9223751 nosotros lo nico que queremos all es protestar ya una vez lo hicimos alianza bravo pueblo y el comando nacional de la resistencia solicitamos la nulidad de la ley habilitante que es la madre de todos los problemas que vienen ocurriendo en el pa s por todas estas imposiciones que hace el presidente de la rep blica el presidente debe m s bien dedicarse a gobernar
9223752 este s bado se anunciar la gran cruzada nacional contra la intenci n de instaurar en venezuela lo que fue rechazado el pasado dos de diciembre
9223753 me dicen que soy un dictador porque estamos haciendo leyes estamos haciendo leyes y las leyes deben irse adecuando a los cambios y el mundo va cambiando las leyes son para igualarnos
9223754 he ingresado voluntariamente en un centro para el tratamiento de la adicci n al sexo
9223755 pido respeto y privacidad para mi mujer y mis hijos mientras superamos esta situaci n como familia
9223756 personas que tienen problemas grandes debido a su comportamiento de igual forma que lo es la dependencia del alcohol
9223757 its a true inner city high school with all the social ills associated with urban education
9223758 many of my students come from extraordinarily challenging social circumstances
9223759 i was given the chance to do something i was interested in working hands on with cars and hands on with teachers and other students ive never had that experience as part of a team
9223760 theyre figuring out these things because they need to and theyre invested
9223761 in real life we dont just sit down in a cubicle and do math they need this math the crux of the project is that they have a product at the end that is theirs
9223762 if the kids replace your brakes they either work or they dont
9223763 you dont get a c in brakes you get an a or an f
9223764 my dad used to work on his car and i would stand around and watch
9223765 id see stuff he wasnt able to do and id think that id know how to do that one day a lot of the stuff you learn in school you dont use but this is something youre actually going to need everything i learned in auto class is everyday
9223766 it helps to know about inertia if youre talking about brakes
9223767 an object at rest will stay at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion thats what causes the jerk when you push the brakes your body is in motion so it causes a jerk automatically whether your brakes are good bad or ugly
9223768 coming out of engineering i thought everybody needed to go to college that was thirteen years ago my goals have evolved i have a degree in engineering and a masters in teaching and now i have my principals certification im at the top of my pay scale for a teacher and my top students will come out and make more money than me by age thirty in college you can come out with debt and some type of degree that doesnt open up great job opportunities they come out of here with a job they love
9223769 the purpose of career academies is not to send those kids off into a small specific career but to use that career to teach through the subjects so they are engaged
9223770 you create that ideal career academy situation having a lot of people involved in kids lives
9223771 that aspect is worth more than any curriculum or award just the fact that these kids are interacting with teachers and college students each one is just one more person in their lives
9223772 these people who had a very low budget were in a competition against some very high budgets
9223773 i was very impressed they were very hungry for knowledge and i could see they were really interested in their future i thought talking about whats out there could open their eyes to the horizons
9223774 there is a crisis in the industry for good technicians
9223775 were dedicated to the program and it will hopefully help them but it will help us and the industry too
9223776 what were trying to do is get students to understand more about electricity and what its like to work as a project team
9223777 its just like a real job the boss gives you so much to spend and thats all you can spend
9223778 a lot of people emerge into adulthood and have never had to complete a multidisciplinary project on time with all the uncertainties of making a device work
9223779 putting things together often requires a type of disciplined thinking that gives instant feedback on whether you can follow through to complete a job in a timely way
9223780 i know i dont think about the smart things being built into my car
9223781 i mean they come with the car right its just whats supposed to be on there anyway isnt it
9223782 now that is something id be interested in knowing about
9223783 drivers are liable to close eyes or slowly move eye gaze right and left when they feel drowsiness
9223784 therefore we believe that we will be able to detect drivers drowsiness by detecting such drivers conditions
9223785 one of the issues in eye gaze technology is the shape of eyes and their periphery
9223786 its not the color of cornea for example western civilization people generally have eyes recessed different when compared to japanese we are currently developing technologies to be able to correctly detect eye gazes regardless of shapes of eyes and their periphery
9223787 correct and appropriate recognition of the environment around a vehicle is indispensable to safe driving and smooth traffic flow
9223788 were developing various detecting technologies to help drivers recognize the environment including pedestrians and road signs around the vehicle
9223789 the system can warn the driver when it is detected that he she does not recognize or isnt looking in the direction of pedestrians or road signs
9223790 so if im not looking at something it knows it
9223791 and once it knows im not it tells me to get with the program or theres going to be trouble right again dennis
9223792 i fell in love with the ferrari 599 but i couldnt afford it so ive settled for the z06 so now were only left with the chevrolet corvette z06 and the ford gt
9223793 enth os julie gravel richard lart la rescousse du corps
9223794 jenkins and co put forward two theories to explain why this might be happening
9223795 some have argued that people can generally be grouped as platonists or aristotelians that is they either have a sense of reality as something out there or of reality as something really here intimately bound up with daily mundanities i intuit that the same is true of spirituality some find their connection with god as the god who is immanent and bound up in the holiness of quotidian mundane life others find that connection in the god of the transcendent who is out there and other and speaks a word of challenge against what we think is our mundane life both sorts can learn from each other both sorts need to learn from each other but a basic orientation one way or the other will still endure im the second kind im a platonist by natural inclination i find god out there and in the transcendent and in the different and in the things that shocking me out of my business as usual way of living and through those experiences can find god and the hoy in the mundane and the everyday in the ways that i can identify god shocking and surprising me towards transcendence as a result i want my worship to be transcendentally oriented i want it to help me get in connection with the god out there so that i can learn the feel the touch the taste of the other and transcendent god in order that i might recognize that same god in my daily eating breathing and moving chant is to the ear what incense is to the nose what stained glass and icons are to the eye culturally conditioned signs of the transcendent but cutting through the culturally based significance vehicles that truly assist me to touch the face of god
9223796 im 73 years old and im 65 years butchering and ive never had any problems only compliments nobodys got sick none of that bullshit at all my customers are quite happy with the products as far as im concerned this shouldnt be in the newspaper anyway
9223797 while these are very serious problems the lack of appropriate infrastructure and the high number of communities still requiring boil orders are raising even more concerns it appears we have a growing crisis in the provision of clean water to our residents and this requires immediate action by government
9223798 im in your blood whether you like it or not you aint going nowhere else are you really enjoy the sunsets and see you next week
9223799 how i sort of but not really salsa danced in cyprus despite trying to avoid all things salsa

9223813 what was really unexpected was that a very large number of white supremacists including some of their intellectual leaders like david duke were saying actually this could be a good thing for us
9223814 we may have to look at that situation and try and monitor
9223815 help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people
9223816 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9223817 as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need
9223818 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9223819 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9223820 this started off just as a citation and when we simply give a citation for a nuisance it tells them what they must do to abate that nuisance and thats all that is required all we could do is fine them
9223821 we do have a procedure in this city that we can file a civil suit against the property itself
9223822 this was simply a nuisance citation it requires them to secure the building cover all open windows cover any entrances to the building have locks on the entrances cover the hole in the roof and they had done all of that except for the windows on the south side of second third and fourth floor
9223823 if the building is sound i dont know what the next step may be if the building is not structurally sound our next step would be to file a civil action against the building and owner and i assume the building would be demolished based on the report results
9223824 the timing was right to take advantage of some of the dislocation in the marketplace and to facilitate some of our transactional work
9223825 if borrowers can go to an expert in the industry that facilitates the process and we have such an extensive client base consisting of lenders potential borrowers and buyers
9223826 the cmbs market has been sidelined so were seeing lenders who couldnt compete with cmbs reemerging and were starting to see new lending outlets predominantly private sources both domestic and international
9223827 i hadnt seen him in here before but he knew his way around the place like he was a local
9223828 if hed paid for it he wouldve really got his moneys worth
9223829 normally i wouldve walked over and ask if he needed any help but i was busy selling scratchies by the time i thought to confront him he was three quarters of the way through it i just had to cross my fingers and hope hed buy a tin of eclipse mints on his way out
9223830 this just goes to prove were still number one when it comes to providing quality reading material for aussie blokes even if they dont want to pay for it
9223831 ive added another strongly worded sign about purchasing things you plan to read right near the ralph slot next time hell think twice before blocking my aisles with his shiftless content stealing carcass
9223832 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9223833 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok

9223878 the governor did nothing wrong and has nothing to hide
9223879 its outrageous that the obama campaign is trying to attack her over a family issue as a reformer and a leader on ethics reform she has been happy to help out in the investigation of this matter because she was never directly involved
9223880 this has been a tumultuous week in the department of public safety and as your governor i apologize
9223881 to investigate the circumstances and events surrounding the termination of former public safety commissioner monegan and potential abuses of power and or improper actions by members of the executive branch
9223882 i think it raises the profile but it doesnt really change the mission or the work
9223883 had threatened to kill my dad and bring me down
9223884 for the record no one ever said fire wooten not the governor not todd not any of the other staff
9223885 what they said directly was more along the lines of this isnt a person that we would want to be representing our state troopers
9223886 this is a governor who really built her name by stepping on the back of sinners randy ruedrich greg renkes frank murkowski
9223887 and now her administration seems to be taking the same approach as the people that she criticized

9223894 into their new radios whilst they co ordinated us in a fire drill ill spare the details but think of its conclusion as being akin to fire engines turning up at an actual blaze and hosing it down with petrol
9223895 who decided to forbid the public from using fire escapes and to post security guards tasked with sending them public back against the flow of foot traffic to find other exits to leave from
9223896 did you clearly tell people what a head count was before asking them to take one
9223897 did you remind people when you trained them that they had to remember what to do
9223898 is it common practice to write a statutory policy and then afterwards see how it fits legislation
9223899 777 so i eventually headed back inside and waited some more and lo and behold i looked up and julie was there coming down the stairs she went looking for me and so i had to chase her down with all my luggage such fun
9223900 theres also this issue that on april 18th she gave birth to a baby with downs syndrome
9223901 thats a very good question and i guess my guess is that perhaps the line inside the mccain campaign would be if it were a man being picked who also had a baby but you know four months ago with downs syndrome would you ask the same question
9223902 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9223903 former mayor of a town of 9 000 just a heartbeat away from the presidency
9223904 todays announcement was an act of political desperation by the mccain campaign but it does not alter the fact that the republican ticket promises ohioans more of the same
9223905 none of my pro hillary female friends are falling for this obvious gop pander
9223906 sarah palin has a great deal of surface appeal at first
9223907 the only thing he is going to let her do in the white house is teach him how to use the internet
9223908 palin makes mccain look ancient out of touch and totally yesterday
9223909 i know hillary clinton and sarah palin is no hillary clinton
9223910 hes been able but undistinguished i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done
9223911 kaine was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9223912 and again with all due respect to richmond virginia its smaller than chula vista california aurora colorado mesa or gilbert arizona north las vegas or henderson nevada its not a big town
9223913 the biggest hurdle is just getting over the fact that you were out a little bit because of stuff going on in your shoulder
9223914 you just have to be smart about your body and how it feels
9223915 were going to see how it reacts and the way it has been is good hopefully ill have an opportunity to get in there soon
9223916 get outa here if you dont know casanova is just being punished for going to desolation row
9223917 i understand destructive urges they seem so imperfect i see i see no e v i i l l
9223918 you know its all like some new kind of drug my senses are hot and my hands are like gloves broadway looks so medieval like a flap from so many pages as i fell sideways laughing with a friend from many stages
9223919 this case this case ive been working on so long
9223920 first albums this good being pretty damn hard to come across
9223921 there is enough moisture and instability in the atmosphere that the heating by the sun in the afternoon is already beginning to produce showers in the san bernardino and riverside mountains
9223922 oh so and so is probably going to be picked so ill edit it to say they were picked since its going to happen anyway
9223923 behind the world food crisis is a global freshwater crisis expected to rapidly worsen as climate change impacts intensify
9223924 irrigation fed agriculture provides 45 percent of the worlds food supplies and without it we could not feed our planets population of six billion people
9223925 we may have to look at that situation and try and monitor
9223926 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9223927 it started from a conversation between and myself complaining about photoshop
9223928 just because it would be unprofessional of me or others to rant about this or that aspect of the company in public dont for a second think its not happening behind closed doors

9223934 in the meantime the commission urges all concerned mauritanian authorities to refrain from taking any institutional and legislative action likely to increase the complexity of the situation
9223935 there were so many people in the public schools that were good to me
9223936 i know when its the right time and the right person
9223937 hes going to be the president of the united states as soon as he gets old enough
9223938 he just has all the traits to contribute to him being successful toy was very dependable in high school and just a joy to have as a guidance counselor
9223939 as someone who loves books it is the pinnacle of private social networking for me
9223940 we would see each other and she just said to me this is what it means to be a friend for me
9223941 i was just thinking this gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9223942 to just have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9223943 i demand an immediate apology from michael moore to the people of south louisiana for his offensive and inappropriate comments
9223944 people in louisiana regardless of political affiliation are making plans to leave to protect their families from this serious storm and the god i know would not share michael moores glee for our plight
9223945 i mean i certainly hope nobody gets hurt i hope everybodys taking cover
9223946 no one is closer to the oil indusry than governor palin
9223947 along with her support for drilling in the artic wildife refuge and off our coasts she also opposes a windfall proft tax on the richest oil companies
9223948 senator mccain has lost any chance of having a balanced or moderate ticket with this choice and has instead opted for the same business as usual reliance on the outdated oil companies that has been the hallmark of the bush cheney administration
9223949 the primary interest and motivation of john mccains candidacy is to reform government and change the way business is done in washington
9223950 for senator obama the solution to every problem and the answer to every challenge is a new tax
9223951 and he is convinced that a 1970s style windfall profits tax is just what america needs in the 21st century
9223952 now as then all a windfall profits tax will accomplish is to increase our dependence on foreign oil and hinder exactly the kind of domestic exploration and production we need im all for recycling but its better applied to paper and plastic than to the failed policies of the 1970s

9224025 jack nodded slowly scanning the massive lobby his eyes fell on a set of wooden stairs going up
9224026 this was once owned by a major corporation there used to be a connector running from this building to the one next door they took it down soon after the deaths started the corporation washed its hands of this place and moved out so it became independently owned after so many deaths they couldnt produce the revenue to keep it running so the survivors were moved out to other facilities

9224151 el funcionamiento viene junto con el manejo del partido la falla es m s de atenci n de aspectos individuales porque hemos errado hemos dejado a un lado la intensidad y subestimado jugadas que nos han costado caro
9224152 el equipo ha dado muy buenos partidos pero es evidente porque as lo dicen los resultados que no han ido acompa ado de los buenos resultados y es algo en el que hemos puesto mucho nfasis porque ha habido detalles en los que nos hemos equivocado eso ha estribado que el resultado no venga con el buen funcionamiento del equipo
9224153 muy complicado por la situaci n que vive tecos porque s ha encontrado una forma de jugar adecuada que le ha redituado quiz en este ltimo partido no pero en otros partidos se ha visto bien con buenos resultados y con un buen funcionamiento entonces ser un equipo muy complicado
9224154 creo que tecos tiene jugadores importantes no solamente el caso de robert de pinho est el
9224155 hemos tenido un buen trabajo tambi n hemos errado en algunas ocasiones creo que todo el equipo porque cuando se gana ganamos todos cuando perdemos perdemos todos creo que en algunas jugadas nos confiamos y eso hace que los otros equipos aprovechen las pocas jugadas que nosotros dejamos que nos hagan
9224156 estamos dolidos pero con ganas de tomar esa revancha enseguida por suerte ya jugamos ma ana jugamos el mi rcoles y perdimos as dolidos como est bamos al siguiente d a ya est bamos pensando en chivas para olvidar el pasado entonces ya se dio vuelta a la p gina ya olvidamos lo que pas y queremos asumir la responsabilidad de este partido
9224157 es un equipo duro como lo es el resto tambi n es un equipo grande a tomar en cuenta nosotros sabemos del plantel que tenemos sabemos que podemos dar m s de lo que hasta ahora hemos dado simplemente eso lo tenemos que transmitir en el campo de juego
9224158 nos ha faltado convertir nos est costando mucho porque s estamos jugando bien y nos ha faltado ese ltimos toque quiz eso tambi n nos cost en el torneo anterior donde morelia encontraba buen futbol pero nos faltaba eso hay que seguir apostando en esto no hay que bajar los brazos hay que tener confianza en que tenemos un gran grupo y que tenemos que seguir trabajando para demostrar que morelia es un gran club un gran equipo
9224159 yo no lo dir a as tengo mucha confianza en mis jugadores hemos trabajado muy bien en el papel puede ser que parezca que entregamos el partido pero en el futbol no hay nada escrito no se gana un partido desde antes hay que jugarlo y en serio les tengo mucha confianza y queremos dar una sorpresa
9224160 s como lo mencionas hubi ramos querido venir al puerto donde nos jugamos el liderato mejor presentados pero las condiciones del primer equipo as nos lo han dado y tenemos nada m s que tres o cuatro son d ez los jugadores que est n en jamaica entonces pr cticamente son los suplentes los que van a tener acci n y en la banca van a estar muchachos de la segunda divisi n pero nosotros estamos tranquilos porque hemos trabajado bien con todos tanto titulares como suplentes y saben lo que queremos son muchachos que tienen calidad y no van a desentonar
9224161 nada m s se quedaron dos titulares y todos los dem s muchachos son los que estado entrando durante la campa a a veces han iniciado o han tenido menor participaci n pero tambi n tienen calidad los muchachos y nos trajimos a lo mejor de la segunda divisi n de ascenso para que nos respalden
9224162 s de repente irritan algunas cosas pero tienes que asimilarlo lo m s pronto posible uno es el reflejo de lo que son sus jugadores y si uno se pone nervioso se ponen nerviosos ellos si uno se pone enojado tambi n ellos entonces lo tomo de la mejor manera s que la instituci n me apoya en todos los sentidos saben que la empresa para el d a de ma ana es dif cil por lo que traemos y tengo todo el respaldo pero a m me gusta ganar y me gusta ganar siempre y salir a buscar el triunfo en cada partido y no lo descarto hasta que no se terminen ma ana los 90 minutos no descarto la posibilidad de llevarnos algo y hay que adaptarse a todo y ponerle buena cara aunque no es f cil
9224163 yo no lo dir a as tengo mucha confianza en mis jugadores hemos trabajado muy bien en el papel puede ser que parezca que entregamos el partido pero en el futbol no hay nada escrito no se gana un partido desde antes hay que jugarlo y en serio les tengo mucha confianza y queremos dar una sorpresa
9224164 todos queremos al pa s lo queremos lo m s limpio posible en todos los sentidos
9224165 ojal que la gente vaya de blanco al estadio para apoyar en contra de la delincuencia m xico es nuestro pa s y hay que cuidarlo
9224166 obviamente que estamos molestos con nosotros mismos por las dos derrotas pero tenemos el nimo dispuesto sabemos que tenemos un buen equipo que este es un partido muy interesante que lo que estamos buscando todo el a o es el poder jugar contra las chivas y conscientes de lo que es guadalajara un equipo que tiene buenos jugadores un equipo que maneja bien su forma de jugar que tiene un mismo esquema desde hace muchos a os que domina muy bien a lo que juega
9224167 hemos sido inconsistentes pero lo m s importante es que tenemos jugadores con calidad experiencia personalidad y eso har que nos podamos parar en cualquier cancha y jugar de igual a igual con cualquiera
9224168 me lo imagino con un guadalajara yendo hacia adelante y nosotros haciendo lo mismo tratando de aprovechar los espacios creo que se podr ver un partido abierto no tanto como se vio el s bado pasado en el que quedaron 5 3 pero s con goles
9224169 siempre sea especial jugar contra las chivas es un equipo muy importante es un equipo que tiene vocaci n ofensiva que s lo tienen aunque muchos dicen que no lo son pero guadalajara desde hace mucho tiempo juega hacia adelante insisto tienen una manera de jugar muy definida con movimientos muy coordinados al ataque cosa que tambi n hace que dejen algunos huecos como los aprovech santos hace una semana que meti cinco goles creo que se podr ver un buen partido
9224170 estamos prepar ndonos ha sido una semana complicada para nosotros pero tenemos la oportunidad de revertir esto tampoco hay que volvernos locos hay que trabajar el partido porque enfrente tenemos un buen rival toluca as que hay que salir a ganar con inteligencia pues ellos son un rival peligroso
9224171 creo que viene toluca preparado para tratar de sorprender y seguir sumando porque ellos est n en una situaci n donde tienen que apretar as que seguramente ser un partido equilibrado
9224172 creo que tenemos que ganar como d lugar y eso es lo que queremos no para nada no es pretexto se dio eso y tenemos que acoplarnos a las circunstancias y hay que salir bien descansados para buscar la victoria con el trabajo que hicimos hoy nos sirvi para aflojar y lo tenemos que hacer as tenemos que descansar y para salir como se ten a planeado
9224173 la verdad contento es el primer partido y si me toca seguir como titular ser bienvenido yo trabajo para ganarme la titularidad y sobre todo ayudar a mi equipo ya quer a jugar se dio esto y ganamos pero lo m s importante es que el equipo va caminando y funcionando de la mejor manera

9224213 he was very quiet i thought kenneth was just a big ol country boy but kenneth was full of knowledge he was so shy around me i had to bring it out of him kenneth was full of real good knowledge for the setup of the race car

9224230 in the beginning when the floods came indian contractors and workers went there and there was little debate between them and without resolving it they returned and this happened

9224236 business traveller specific flights which have an intermediate class between economy and business and use a combination of premium pricing timing and actually disallowing children to make the flight child free
9224237 children are not encouraged because most parents especially indians do not know how to manage or discipline their spawn they run amok and damage our property whilst the parents look on unconcerned
9224238 the tryst is for relaxation and enjoyment of nature and we cater mostly to foreign clientele i am sure they would prefer to stay in a child free zone during their holidays for obvious reasons
9224239 private places can keep the right of entry reserved all of this so long as they the rules are not unreasonable

9224257 many americans who received tax rebates are spending them businesses are taking advantage of tax incentives to purchase new equipment this year and there are signs that the stimulus package will continue to have a beneficial impact on the economy in the second half of the year
9224258 there are families across our country struggling to make ends meet

9224270 we went to fca camp as well and many of my kids were saved in the process
9224271 as christians we want to let everyone hear the gospel as teachers and coaches we have to watch what we say most time
9224272 but i will say that fca camp is the best team building opportunity a team can have

9224288 abraham es llamado amigo de dios isa as 41 8 y jes s llama tambi n a sus disc pulos en virtud de una relaci n intima de amor y obediencia juan 15 14 15 en el inicio de mi ministerio tuve esta experiencia que me hizo comprender el amor de dios en todas sus dimensiones dorm a una noche en mi hogar y cre ser despertado parado junto a m estaba el se or jes s ve a claramente su manto blanco y su pelo largo que ca a sobre sus hombros de pronto levant sus manos y las puso sobre mi cabeza corrientes sobrenaturales del esp ritu santo empezaron a fluir por todo m ser mientras sus manos benditas segu an sobe mi r os de agua viva segu an movi ndose por mi interior pase unos instantes envuelto en aquella bendici n maravillosa y el se or levanto sus manos y se movi para marcharse camino varios pasos alej ndose pero de pronto se detuvo y se volvi hacia mi llegando junto a mi cuerpo se inclino y acercando su rostro a mi me beso varias veces en una mejilla se enderez y luego movi ndose hacia un lado desapareci atravesando la pared nunca olvidare esta experiencia de amor aleluya el amor es lo que hace que los lazos de amistad no se rompan dios nos am y al ofrecernos su salvaci n nos invita a obedecerle y a amarle con todo nuestro ser y al pr jimo como a nosotros mismos y que es amar a dios en juan 14 21 jes s dijo si alguno me ama guardar mi palabra y yo vendr y me manifestare a el para dios solo los que guardan su palabra y le obedecen son los que le aman somos sus amigos y amigas cuando nos comprometemos a guardar su palabra no importa el nombre de tu religi n si t no guardas su palabra no le amas es lo nico que dios nos pide aun desde el inicio de la creaci n obediencia fue lo que le pidi a ad n y eva y por consiguiente a todos los que decidan hacer su perfecta voluntad por eso la biblia nos dice en mateo 7 21 no todo el que me dice se or se or entrara en el reino de los cielos sino el que hace la voluntad de mi padre que esta en los cielos los que le obedecen se ir n con el al lugar que nos fue a preparar recuerda la religi n no puede salvarte solo cristo salva y los que le reciben y creen en su nombre el les da el poder de ser hechos hijos de dios no todos son hijos de dios sino aquellos y aquella que deciden aceptarlo y vivir para el en obediencia por eso te recomendamos que te rindas a el te aseguro que el esp ritu santo vendr sobre ti y te transformar en su hijo e hija el prometi darte vida y vida en abundancia
9224289 usted cree todo lo que aqu dice sin tener ninguna duda en su coraz n
9224290 yo creo que esta palabra del se or es irracional pero sobre todo inmoral pero all cada loco con su cuento
9224291 oiga acabe y d game porque usted piensa que jes s es inmoral
9224292 yo no dije eso se or el personaje de jes s ha dicho y hecho cosas que considero buenas pero si analizamos objetivamente todo lo que narra los evangelios hay que concluir que muchas ense anzas como la que contiene este tratado son malvadas y muchas veces adornadas con mentiras por parte del escritor
9224293 ok entiendo tu punto ha habido ocasiones donde otras personas que conozco han entrado en conflictos emocionales por cosas que contiene la biblia pero en este caso en particular que es lo que considera inmoral o malvado
9224294 antes de contestarle tengo que felicitarle la mayor a de las personas que abiertamente hacen profesiones de fe como la que usted ha hecho hoy entregando tratados en un lugar p blico no reciben cr ticas de una forma tan tranquila como lo ha hecho usted muchos en el pasado me han insultado sin querer escuchar mi opini n solo por no pensar como ellos volviendo al tema creo que la ense anza es inmoral porque esta basada en un concepto distorsionado de lo que es el amor de amigos y esto termina en manipulaci n d jeme explicarle usted tiene amigos cercanos de esos que son m s que amigos de los que se considera como hermanos que se ha mantenido en contacto con ellos desde la adolescencia
9224295 eres capaz tu de limitar ese amor de amigo a la obediencia de tu persona en otras palabras t consideras a tus amigos tus sirvientes personas que si quieren permanecer como tus amigos deben obedecerte y hacer todo lo que t hagas podemos considerar eso amistad genuina mi opini n es que no eso es manipulaci n yo no tendr a una buena opini n de alguien que me dijera que si quiero ser su amigo tengo que obedecerle eso es amor de emperador y dictador es malvado
9224296 entiendo tu punto pero no debemos sujetar ni juzgar a dios por est ndares humanos no creo que esto este bien
9224297 pues son los nicos est ndares que tenemos para tomar decisiones y si crees que fuimos creados a imagen y semejanza de dios no creo que tengamos est ndares de conducta y moralidad muy diferentes
9224298 que es una mentira y perm teme demostrarte porque pienso as nadie sabe nada sobre la existencia de jes s fuera de la biblia mucho menos su apariencia para empezar los sue os que tenemos mientras dormimos no tienen ning n impacto en el futuro m s bien estos son influenciados por lo que creemos y por el pasado esto es un hecho cient ficamente demostrado el primer intento de hacerle una imagen al personaje de jes s vino cientos de anos despu s de los primeros evangelios que en si mismos vinieron cientos de anos despu s de los eventos que describen la imagen tradicional de jes s es un figmento de la imaginaci n de hecho la imagen de jes s es un reflejo de los prejuicios raciales que tiene la humanidad en general nadie sabe si jes s es blanco de pelo claro y largo como se presenta en todas las im genes o un negro bemb n con un afro es interesante notar tambi n que el escritor del tratado rev yiye vila siempre ha tomado una postura conservadora cuando del pelo masculino se trata siempre recuerdo cuando preadolescente estar en casa de mi abuela una noche viendo su programa televisivo donde dec a sin tapujos que el cabello largo en los hombre es un s mbolo de perdici n
9224299 decir que se ve feo no es lo mismo que decir que es un s mbolo de perdici n la primera es una diferencia de apreciaci n personal y sujetiva mientras que la segunda es un ataque a la integridad del individuo y un juicio a su inferioridad moral
9224300 yiye vila esta siendo inconsistente aqu si jes s tiene el pelo largo porque condenar de pecadores a los hombres que tambi n deseen tenerlo as
9224301 no encuentras interesante que no hay ninguna descripci n de la cara de jes s en el tratado
9224302 lo que pasa es que la biblia dice que nadie le puede ver la cara a dios y quedar vivo
9224303 he encontrado muy interesante tambi n el argumento de que no es la religi n la que salva sino una relaci n con jes s no he le do una mejor forma de decir que mi religi n es la verdadera y la tuya no ese mismo argumento lo usan los musulmanes cuando dicen que no es religi n sino relaci n con ala seg n la revelaci n de mahoma dada por el ngel gabriel pero por experiencia hay algo de lo cual no tengo ninguna duda en mi coraz n
9224304 que todos los que dicen tener revelaciones est n mintiendo descaradamente menci name una revelaci n que tenga alguna relevancia para el hombre un secreto divino que termine con las guerras el hambre y las enfermedades digno de un dios que verdaderamente ama y le importa la vida en la tierra no hay ninguna y este charlat n quiere que yo me crea que dios me ama solo porque tuvo un sue o mojado con un fantasma que le dio un beso en la mejilla por favor esto es rid culo

9224321 the failures of the recovery are an act of our government if we refuse to address this as a nation it will go down in history not only as a failure of leadership but also as a failure to hold our government accountable

9224338 empirical evidence and professional norms do not support the idea that homosexuality is a form of mental illness or is inherently linked to psychopathology
9224339 unaware of each subjects sexual orientation two independent rorschach experts evaluated the mens overall adjustment using a 5 point scale they classified two thirds of the heterosexuals and two thirds of the homosexuals in the three highest categories of adjustment when asked to identify which rorschach protocols were obtained from homosexuals the experts could not distinguish respondents sexual orientation at a level better than chance hooker concluded from her data that homosexuality is not a clinical entity and that homosexuality is not inherently associated with psychopathology
9224340 homosexuality in and of itself is unrelated to psychological disturbance or maladjustment homosexuals as a group are not more psychologically disturbed on account of their homosexuality
9224341 la verdad es una alegr a inmensa lograr esto ante mi gente me cost pero sali y estoy feliz haber cambiado de equipo antes de sta fecha fue una gran apuesta mantuve el motor de gerardo salaverr a y pen con el chasis pero ste trazado es muy exigente y eso estaba dentro de los inconvenientes l gicos para la clasificaci n puse neum ticos nuevos adelante y los estrenados en entrenamientos atr s el resto fue cuesti n de arriesgar ya que al igual que el resto de los competidores no utilic el nuevo trazado desde octubre del a o pasado
9224342 es muy importante esta nueva pole aunque lo importante es lo de ma ana este punto es producto del gran auto que tenemos y de la gran familia del honda petrobras sinceramente esta era la pole que menos esperaba por c mo se hab an dado los entrenamientos pero el trabajo del equipo y el hecho de poder aprovechar los neum ticos fueron claves para lograrla siempre estamos ah y es cuesti n de no cometer errores para poder descontar puntos y no perderlos ya que a esta altura los perdidos pueden ser vitales
9224343 el auto siempre respondi para mejor ante cada cambio lo m o es aprender siempre hice una vuelta limpia y eso me permiti estar en este lugar
9224344 si bien l por l pez dice que es un punto nada m s con las poles ya me descont como siete ya sin dudas sigue siendo referente a la hora de clasificar
9224345 no llegamos con buenas gomas a la ltima parte de la clasifica y eso nos complic si en carrera podemos terminar adelante y aumentar la ventaja actual ser muy positivo ya que analizando lo sucedido hasta ahora la diferencia existente no la marca la performance del auto sino algunos errores que aprovechamos
9224346 el a o pasado tuvimos una carrera magn fica en spa acab sexto que fue uno de mis mejores resultados de la temporada
9224347 en estos momentos lo m s importante para el equipo es que hemos identificado d nde podemos mejorar el fw30 y estamos realizando los ajustes necesarios para afrontar las ltimas carreras

9224422 i know gov palin from the national governors conference and shes a very effective leader and shes a reformer and i like her very much because she has the strength to go and push back
9224423 frankly i was very energized i think thats an exciting choice that the first woman vice president of the united states is going to be a republican shes hardworking comes from a hardworking family five kids her efforts in terms of renewable energy out in alaska and dealing with the whole green economy
9224424 my wife and i were just talking about it and shes really excited because the governor represents a lot of women in america that are working that are taking care of their families and are still able to find that balance i think shes an awesome an excellent role model for our country
9224425 i think the candidacy of sen clinton has already made gender old hat in a way and people are now going to be analyzing the candidates on their positions and ive been getting a number of e mails from women this morning pointing out that sen mccain is anti choice and that doesnt change with the selection of a woman as vp
9224426 i think its an interesting choice theres nothing historic about it democrats had a woman almost 25 years ago nominated as vice president shes anti choice so i dont think she brings much as far as independents but its interesting that out of their entire universe this is the best they thought they could come up with
9224427 my opinion is that a pro life woman has no chance of winning any kind of an election to me this pick basically demonstrates that democrats know what theyre doing and republicans dont its like hollywood i mean we put up a woman is she the best woman candidate no in my opinion its because shes a woman and shes 44 and shes pretty

9224472 an important driving factor behind the increase in cosmetic and weight reduction surgery may well be the large number of reality television programs that focus on weight loss and radical appearance change
9224473 most programs focus on the few individuals who have the most dramatic changes in appearance thus exaggerating the likelihood of positive outcomes
9224474 complications infections and failed procedures are barely mentioned giving the impression that negative outcomes are rare
9224475 and the environments in which appearance medicine programs are filmed are often highly artificial as most people dont have access to the same level of resources equipment personal trainers and chefs
9224476 given the dissatisfaction that participants typically express about themselves and their lives at the programs commencement the extreme psychological pressure that is created during filming and the difficulty of maintaining rapid weight loss it would be surprising if all participants and their families walked away unscathed

9224481 this is why you put in all the work hopefully i can keep it going
9224482 that gave me a lot of confidence that i could win

9224484 ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9224485 i can go out there and rip away i have nothing to lose pretty much its just step up and rip it

9224502 the accord will provide for 200 million dollars a year over the next 25 years through investments in infrastructure projects in libya
9224503 this agreement should put an end to 40 years of discord it is a concrete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era
9224504 this is an historic moment when two brave men acknowledge the defeat of colonialism
9224505 the libyan people endured injustice and were attacked in their homes and they deserve an apology and compensation
9224506 a sudden burst of dignity humanity and respect so as to finally give satisfaction to the 20 000 italian citizens who are still waiting for fair compensation from their government
9224507 an important driving factor behind the increase in cosmetic and weight reduction surgery may well be the large number of reality television programs that focus on weight loss and radical appearance change

9224524 my biggest worry is that she is so good im worried how im going to get past her more than anything
9224525 its probably out of the games that we have played so far no disrespect we thought getting seven points out of nine was a good start and maybe we were expecting that given the games we had but i thought this would be the severest test
9224526 i felt dundee united probably had a lot of possession in the first half we kept maybe giving the ball away too quickly but we defended well
9224527 we restricted them to few opportunities and i think most of their danger was going to come from a corner or a free kick
9224528 we worked all week and i told them all day yesterday this is what they are going to face
9224529 some big lads good deliveries and youre going to have to stand up and be counted and weve done well so far but i think it is going to be on to another level and it was like that
9224530 but getting the goal just before half time gave us a massive lift and it was a well worked goal dundee united slept at the corner and gavins come in ghosted in and got a great header
9224531 it allowed me to go in and rather than have a big man like connor sammon up front it mightve ended up an aerial battle and i felt the two boys into feet with david fernandez and mehdi taouil was more productive for us
9224532 in the second half they held the ball and they orchestrated everything
9224533 but we were under pressure and expected that coming here so we just that we would always get chances to score and if we could defend well and keep a clean sheet we could come away with a win today
9224534 we have had no contact from anyone for several weeks about him

9224693 at the same time they are achievement oriented and keen on staying current in their field and this holds true in all regions studied so it wasnt a surprise to learn that by a clear margin the opportunity for training and development is the most important driver of increased performance for it employees
9224694 while organizations are keen to maximize the contribution of each individual people need to find purpose and satisfaction in what they do full engagement develops from an alignment of maximum job satisfaction with maximum job contribution

9224699 most business owners have never before sold a business and they know very little about selling their businesses for the most money a majority of business brokers and intermediaries just dont understand the accounting tax and financial concepts involved in maximizing a businesses value

9224714 i audit hundreds of real estate files every year and this file takes the cake
9224715 if anyone is looking for a trademark signature of mortgage fraud i think theyll find it in what has already been reported by crains detroit business and the detroit free press from fabrication of bruce mcclellans assets and making outrageous claims about mcclellans guaranteed return on his investment to making no real attempt to sell the investment property and taking cash back at closing here as reported by crains detroit business and the detroit free press we have what appears to be a very questionable situation

9224725 it is possible to master leadership under conditions of shared responsibility
9224726 throughout my 20 years in the field ive found one fundamental principle that accounts for the difference between truly great team builders and those who are average struggling or failing the difference is in how they deal with personal and shared responsibility effective teams feel it on effective teams if one person drops the ball another picks it up and if one person makes a mistake or falls behind another lends a hand low and average performing teams seem to lack this sense of shared responsibility i developed the knowledge team leadership program to give team leaders and members the tools they need to deliver results and have fun with any team starting immediately

9224788 it was a good way to start the season and it was a well deserved win
9224789 we started really strong followed the game plan and took an early lead delaware converted on a good opportunity to make the game 3 1 and capitalized again later but the team stayed strong and we got the result we came out for im excited the first game is over and im looking forward to another match up tomorrow

9224835 i guess its the old risk management of having your eggs spread out among many baskets
9224836 assume that nebraskans had this and our nebraska citizens overall lost 100 million some of the money will go to the state thats like a tax it comes right out of the citizenry and it doesnt do any development at all some of the money will go for operations and the rest of the money will go for profits sponsors of both of these casino proposals are out of state corporations so youre not talking about development for nebraska when you talk about transferring money to nevada and the state
9224837 i think its cynical on the part of the state to raise money from people who basically cant afford it by promising them a dream that is not going to come true for any but the tiniest tiniest fraction of the people who participate and that causes people to get into the kind of trouble i hear about every day

9224854 if a governor decides to stay home then we will make changes to the schedule but as of today there are no changes
9224855 it is true that we are monitoring the situation of course and there is a chance we can change the schedule but at this time we have not made any changes
9224856 we may have to look at that situation and try and monitor
9224857 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster

9224882 one of john mccains most admirable traits has been his eloquent opposition to the use of torture against suspected terrorists

9224890 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9224891 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9224892 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9224893 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9224894 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9224895 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9224896 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9224897 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9224898 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9224899 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9224900 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9224901 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9224902 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9224903 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9224904 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9224905 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9224906 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9224907 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9224908 who are open to doing something on the production side
9224909 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9224910 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9224911 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9224912 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9224913 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9224914 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9224915 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9224916 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9224917 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9224918 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9224919 a fost un arbitraj echilibrat probabil cel mai bun din meciurile cu dinamo
9224920 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9224921 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9224922 the creator of honor harrington explains this volumes heft by admitting that he likes to tell long stories hence his many long novels and the fact that even his short stories arent very they constitute a sampling of what a genius level storyteller does between novels that is worth adding to most sf collections
9224923 one of the best things about swanwicks storytelling is that it is always worth another read this volume is the perfect package for assuring that his most rereadable fiction is always at hand
9224924 in the hearts and minds of bradbury enthusiasts green town illinois is as treasurable in fantastic literature as baums emerald city or lewis narnia modeled after the authors boyhood home of waukegan idyllic midwestern green town was the setting for bradburys novels dandelion wine 1957 and something wicked this way comes 1962 as well as a handful of short stories bradburys familiar poetic magic sings in every paragraph reminding his readers why green town is worth visiting again and again
9224925 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9224926 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9224927 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9224928 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9224929 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9224930 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9224931 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9224932 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9224933 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9224934 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9224935 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9224936 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9224937 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9224938 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9224939 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9224940 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9224941 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9224942 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9224943 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9224944 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9224945 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9224946 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9224947 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9224948 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9224949 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9224950 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9224951 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9224952 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9224953 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9224954 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9224955 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9224956 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9224957 venezuela will always be there to defend the interests of our peoples
9224958 in venezuela we are advancing a national development project which we are bringing closer to that of the government of argentina
9224959 those who command our democracies are the people and the people have said enough with the oligarchy another america is possible and we are lifting it up
9224960 im definitely at my best especially as far as understanding the game williams said
9224961 the wimbledon win helped me a lot to change my mentality to realize not everything had to be perfect all the time
9224962 now if i dont have a perfect practice i know i can play that helps me to relax so i think a lot of it has to do with playing well at wimbledon
9224963 i have a very good feeling about the next round williams said
9224964 i didnt know much about what i was doing williams said
9224965 i didnt understand anything i was just playing i didnt understand the strategy so much id like to think im wiser now and ready to listen to my coach
9224966 she was playing solid but my wrist went out in that match and that was it for me until february the next year williams said
9224967 i tried to slice but it was tough out there
9224968 since that time she has gone on to the top 10 obviously shes a good player
9224969 i know i can play against all those players and even beat them radwanska said
9224970 im playing much better this year im playing good and very quick

9225015 es war unglaublich wir haben nicht damit gerechnet auf die achte position zu kommen auch ohne den ausritt
9225016 es war so entt uschend dort zu sitzen in den reifenstapeln auf meiner ersten runde im qualifying
9225017 um ehrlich zu sein konnte ich es nicht glauben die fans hier bei meinem heimrennen das war so peinlich
9225018 der wagen war im anschluss fantastisch und wir konnten eine sehr gute rundenzeit fahren
9225019 sie mussten die diffusor austauschen und noch einiges andere reparieren sie hatten einiges zu tun aber sie waren sehr schnell der wagen war im anschluss fantastisch und wir konnten eine sehr gute rundenzeit fahren
9225020 ich wei es auch nicht ich denke nicht dass ich zu sp t gebremst habe vielleicht waren die bremsen nicht warm genug
9225021 es war die erste runde und ich habe nicht zu hart gepusht wir wollten eh noch drei stints fahren das ganze hat mich schon berrascht
9225022 ich bin total erleichtert die tests sind nicht so gelaufen wie ich mir das vorgestellt hatte
9225023 wir haben hart gearbeitet ich wusste wenn ich mich noch verbessern kann haben wir gute chancen auf die top acht platz sechs ist ein gutes ergebnis f r mich und das team
9225024 er arbeitet sich in den trainings konsequent dahin und l sst sich nicht durcheinander bringen ich glaube das ist seine st rke egal ob er im freien training platz 14 oder 15 ist er wei was er kann er glaubt an sich und setzt das immer um
9225025 mein ziel ist punkte sammeln hoffentlich sind die top 5 m glich es w re gut einen guten start zu haben aber zuerst m ssen wir sehen was das wetter macht
9225026 ich habe mit einem hundertstel die top 8 verpasst es ist nat rlich sehr rgerlich wenn es so knapp ist aber das ist auf so kurzen strecken immer so
9225027 ich bin in reichweite der punkte und da werde ich morgen versuchen hinzukommen
9225028 und wenn ich meine theoretische runde anschaue dann habe ich auf meiner schnellsten runde im letzten eineinhalb zehntel verloren das ist rgerlich auf der anderen seite ist p10 nicht so schlecht ich bin in reichweite der punkte und da werde ich morgen versuchen hinzukommen
9225029 zufrieden bin ich ehrlich gesagt nicht ich war gestern im test und heute im freien training eigentlich ganz gut mit dabei ich war schnellstes vorjahresauto deshalb war ich eigentlich ziemlich optimistisch f r das qualifying
9225030 ich habe auf platz zehn gehofft aber es hat nicht geklappt ich denke dass wir das maximale herausgeholt haben wir k nnen nicht schneller als 42 7 fahren und das sind wir jedes mal gefahren die rennstrecke ist ein bisschen besser geworden das war bei den anderen ein vorteil bei uns ein nachteil
9225031 wenn es regnet werden wir letzter und wenn es trocken ist holen wir hoffentlich einen punkt im regen habe ich keinen grip ich wei nicht warum
9225032 ich bin nat rlich sehr entt uscht aber es ist wie es ist ich habe einen fehler in kurve zwei gemacht
9225033 und ich wei nicht warum sie katherine und mich nicht zur ckgestellt haben auf die strecke aber so ist es nun mal
9225034 die vorhersage spricht von einem heftigen gewitter wir m ssen abwarten alles ist noch m glich weil die strecke so kurz ist wir m ssen konstanter sein als die anderen aber es ist nat rlich nicht leicht wenn man von da hinten startet

9225061 this bill is a common sense approach to a very serious issue facing many victims of domestic violence stalking and sexual assault having to choose between breaking a rental agreement and risking their personal safety
9225062 these victims have already suffered horrible abuse so they should have all the tools they need to escape from their abusers this bill accomplishes that goal
9225063 domestic violence victims have been severely injured within their own rental units yet have been unable to negotiate lease termination agreements with their landlords
9225064 ab 2052 would assist those victims by ensuring that they can move to safer homes without facing substantial financial penalties or ruining their credit
9225065 people throughout the state are deeply concerned about the quality and reliability of water
9225066 some bay area and southern california cities are under mandatory water rationing growers in san diego county are stumping their avocado trees and pulling out citrus trees new commercial developments in riverside county have stopped because water supplies are not guaranteed
9225067 the san luis reservoir which supplies water to san benito and santa clara counties now holds only 13 percent of its full capacity crops are dying in the fields and farm workers are out of work unemployed
9225068 we started with the schwarzenegger feinstein proposal several weeks ago and worked to identify the changes needed for it to win support in the legislature
9225069 its a work in process but weve moved closer to a consensus product than has ever been achieved
9225070 this bill is the closest weve ever been to getting a bond measure passed
9225071 theres a short list of differences lets take that short list and get it before the voters
9225072 im pleased that the funding will be available for a whole range of water needs in my district
9225073 this is a compromise measure we need to keep moving to find the additional compromises that will produce a winning measure our communities are hurting
9225074 this is the closest weve been in my career to finding a winning proposal the elements of success are in front of you we cant let this opportunity pass
9225075 i urge a compromise in the next few days i think you are well within the range of being able to do that

9225080 uno come lui farebbe comodo la mia prima scelta da tempo ma rispetto le decisioni della societ
9225081 mi aspettavo una gara difficile il risultato la conseguenza logica dellincontro dove abbiamo prevalso un tempo per uno
9225082 non sono superfelice ha proseguito perch lo sono quando vinco
9225083 se non arriva andremo avanti lo stesso la societ sa che lui la mia prima scelta da tanto tempo e che un giocatore cos sarebbe molto utile ma se la decisione della societ io continuer a lavorare con i giocatori che ho che rappresentano unottima base
9225084 abbiamo giocato bene anche in attacco non abbiamo bisogno di quaresma sapevamo che genova era un campo difficile e questo pu essere un insegnamento per mourinho
9225085 se c una squadra che meritava la vittoria quella la sampdoria
9225086 abbiamo preso gol sullunico tiro in porta che hanno fatto ha aggiunto lallenatore della samp i miei giocatori sono stati bravi a non andare allarrembaggio e ad aspettare il momento giusto poi abbiamo fatto degli aggiustamenti e linserimento di padalino ha dato pi incisivit alla manovra stasera abbiamo messo sotto una grande squadra ha concluso mazzarri in campo si sono viste due formazioni che hanno onorato il calcio
9225087 whoever wins or loses this one will not make much difference to what is going to be the outcome of the season
9225088 what it will do is appease your set of fans appease everybody at the training ground and at the club
9225089 and before you know it its gone and the next game is upon you and you have to dust yourself down if you get beat and go again
9225090 rangers this season have got to look to try and get this championship under their belt
9225091 the last few have gone to celtic and this season in particular is the one that they will want to take and want to try and break that momentum that celtic have
9225092 irrespective of what happens there will be issues that develop in an old firm match whether it be a throw in corner a free kick or whatever a yellow card a red card its just the tense affair that old firm games carry
9225093 its one of these days i was really pleased by the way we played
9225094 i honestly couldnt see us losing the game by the way were playing
9225095 but goals change matches and weve made two mistakes in the game and lost two goals
9225096 and if i remember correctly kilmarnock have had two shots on goal in the 90 minutes and scored with both of them
9225097 weve had well i couldnt count the amount of opportunities weve had but we didnt take them and from my point of view ive got to look at two defensive errors and thats something i will have a look at
9225098 i just think were anxious in front of goal there were opportunities in the second half three of them where we actually hit our own player with the shot which you know for me tells you that thats the case instead of having a little bit of composure and place the ball we just lashed at it and it hit our own players
9225099 but if we play like that every week ill be happy
9225100 i dont know its at home and obviously weve got a difficult start four of our first six games are away from home and one of those is celtic so this game was important for us today but no matter how much you want to win it doesnt always work that way
9225101 and we certainly worked our socks off we have absolutely no complaints whatsoever with the way the guys applied themselves we passed the ball excellently at times particularly in the first half but just couldnt put the ball in the net

9225104 obviously with the news today that governor pawlenty was not named to the republican ticket is a certainty that we are going to be having governor pawlenty in 2009 and we know his strong feelings about general taxes were going to have to work with him as weve done the past two years to figure out our very significant budget issues
9225105 the cost of health care is something that is breaking the budgets of families all over the state its breaking the back of businesses all around the state as well

9225112 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too

9225116 counsel and advice of somebody whos not going to agree with me 100 percent of the time
9225117 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9225118 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9225119 run this place like a business not a government bureaucracy
9225120 its probably out of the games that we have played so far no disrespect we thought getting seven points out of nine was a good start and maybe we were expecting that given the games we had but i thought this would be the severest test
9225121 i felt dundee united probably had a lot of possession in the first half we kept maybe giving the ball away too quickly but we defended well
9225122 we restricted them to few opportunities and i think most of their danger was going to come from a corner or a free kick
9225123 we worked all week and i told them all day yesterday this is what they are going to face
9225124 some big lads good deliveries and youre going to have to stand up and be counted and weve done well so far but i think it is going to be on to another level and it was like that
9225125 but getting the goal just before half time gave us a massive lift and it was a well worked goal dundee united slept at the corner and gavins come in ghosted in and got a great header
9225126 it allowed me to go in and rather than have a big man like connor sammon up front it mightve ended up an aerial battle and i felt the two boys into feet with david fernandez and mehdi taouil was more productive for us
9225127 in the second half they held the ball and they orchestrated everything
9225128 but we were under pressure and expected that coming here so we just that we would always get chances to score and if we could defend well and keep a clean sheet we could come away with a win today
9225129 we have had no contact from anyone for several weeks about him

9225265 gov palin is a classic alaska story she is an example of the opportunity our state offers to those with talent initiative and determination selecting palin may prove to be a brilliant political stroke for mccain like him shes an independent who bucked her party establishment and has worked with liberal democrats shes an ethics reforming outsider who will help blunt barack obamas claim to be the candidate of change in washington for all those advantages palin joins the ticket with one huge weakness shes a total beginner on national and international issues
9225266 palins image as a fresh reformer works on some level for the moment
9225267 alaskans awoke friday morning to the surprise news that gov
9225268 voters will be deciding in the general election whether they prefer an experienced president and less experienced vice president or what the democrats offer a rising star for president and seasoned vice president it wont be far from anyones mind either that mccain is the oldest presidential candidate ever there are chinks in her armor but she has a tendency to just move past them and continue to fight for what she believes in palin is energetic as a candidate and perhaps as vice president she will be integral in positioning alaska as it strives to develop its natural resources and give the nation a solution to its energy problem congratulations gov palin youve come a long way

9225364 senator mccain has not only succeed in unifying our party but also succeeded in generating enormous enthusiasm whereas the democrats are against all odds still struggling to pull their base together
9225365 so this is the future of the republican party you are looking at a future in which national security has bumped down the list of priorities behind abortion politics gender politics and energy politics
9225366 ms palin is a bold pick and probably a shrewd one its not nearly so clear that she is a responsible pick or a wise one
9225367 her executive experience consists of less than two years as governor of her sparsely populated state plus six years as mayor of wasilla pop 8 471
9225368 i would put governor palins credentials up versus senator obama any day of the week
9225369 she has executive experience she has a much greater understanding of the international oil markets and she certainly has the qualifications to be president
9225370 it is my duty as a head of government to express to you in the name of the italian people our regret and apologies for the deep wounds that we have caused you
9225371 the accord will provide for 200 million dollars a year over the next 25 years through investments in infrastructure projects in libya
9225372 this agreement should put an end to 40 years of discord it is a concrete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era
9225373 this is an historic moment when two brave men acknowledge the defeat of colonialism
9225374 the libyan people endured injustice and were attacked in their homes and they deserve an apology and compensation
9225375 a sudden burst of dignity humanity and respect so as to finally give satisfaction to the 20 000 italian citizens who are still waiting for fair compensation from their government
9225376 i heard somebody saying theyre coming theyre coming and feet pounding on the back stairs pounding on the door saying they had a search warrant they busted through the door theyve got their guns cocked at people
9225377 im offended by barack obama saying that about my husband
9225378 i was just thinking this hurricane gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9225379 to have it planned at the same time that it would actually be on its way to new orleans for day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river

9225388 assolutamente si ho sentito le critiche a kimi ma alcune brutte gare non significano che si e in crisi
9225389 there you see her sitting there across the way she dont have a lot to say great now stuck in my head
9225390 out of the box very independent minded surprising in many ways
9225391 hes been able to find somebody outside of washington who has been a change agent in alaska and who can give the senator and the governor a chance to say to the american people were as much for change as the democratic nominees
9225392 can walk in the front door of the white house today and run the country
9225393 i think she can i think the answer is absolutely yes
9225394 shes running the state of alaska which is a very diverse state
9225395 we all know with obama at the top of the ticket in illinois youre going to have people voting who have never voted before
9225396 so were worried about our candidates further on down the ballot
9225397 she will attract some of the womens vote but there are other women that are obviously going to be for obama and biden
9225398 this historic decision is a reminder that john mccain is serious about bringing real change to washington
9225399 governor palin is a proven leader who has taken on members of her own party led on ethics reform and has fought wasteful spending and higher taxes this bold pick confirms our doubts about barack obamas abilities to change the country when he has done nothing to change illinois
9225400 it doesnt sound like she has much experience the obama campaign says it basically takes the experience factor off the table
9225401 this is a little more than what we had in mind in such a short time
9225402 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok

9225735 undoubtedly not all these pressures and arrests are reflective of recently developed government concerns and suspicions forces that are against liberty also use the u s budget allocation as a pretext or excuse to legitimize their opposition to civil liberties and to discredit their critics
9225736 it is not right for independent individuals and institutions inside iran to pay the price for allocated funds that the united states government spends on broadcasting from the united states into iran or for the activities of exiled iranian groups that cooperate with various american organizations
9225737 this is why i hereby make a plea to you and your respected organizations to insist that the united states government change its ways or in case of its insistence on allocating a yearly budget make public and transparent the exact amount and recipients individuals and groups of these funds

9225762 let me tell you the reason i picked joe biden
9225763 number three is somebody who i know in his heart cares about the american people and the american dream and is willing to fight for them as hard as he can and joe biden fit that bill
9225764 what do you think of senator mccains vice presidential choice and how does it change the dynamics of this campaign
9225765 well i dont know governor palin i have not met her before i had a brief conversation with her after she was selected to congratulate her and wish her luck but not too much luck on the campaign trial and she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and a up and coming public servant
9225766 so its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be
9225767 my sense is that she subscribes to john mccains agenda and ultimately this election is going to be about where i want to take the country and where joe biden wants to take the country and where john mccain and his running mate want to take the country

9225773 oggi io stesso faccio i complimenti ai miei giocatori abbiamo messo alle corde una squadra come linter con questo modulo lo scorso abbiamo ottenuto un pareggio e quattro vittorie di cui una a milano con il milan meritavamo di pi ai punti se si vanno a vedere le occasioni create nellavvio non siamo stati fortunati abbiamo preso gol poi siamo stati bravi a recuperare nel modo corretto correndo su ogni pallone nella ripresa invece abbiamo giocato alla grande e si poteva anche far qualcosa di pi siamo noi ad essere rammaricati per il risultato campagnaro uscito perch ha chiesto il cambio lui padalino ha fatto bene come stankevicius
9225774 un pari che fa molto morale prestazione eccellente e il merito va soprattutto a mazzarri
9225775 nellazione del gol ho preso una botta e dopoci capivo pi niente se aveva segnato delvecchio o se aveva dato rigore gennaro ha segnato e siamo molto contenti da sottilineare la nostra grande prova e paradossalmente potevamo anche vincere nellazione di cassano linter sono sempre i favoriti per lo scudetto e saranno protagonisti anche questanno oggi abbiamo avuto grande spiri todi sacrificio davvero una grande partenza in casa sperando di fare come lanno passato siamo fiduciosi
9225776 abbiamo dimostrato di essere una squadra che in casa si fa rispettare il risultato pi che giusto il gol e un gol cercato ci credevo oggi ho visto quella palla e con lesterno lho messa nellangolino lo dedico a gionata mingozzi ex centrocampista del treviso ndr un ragazzo che purtroppo ha perso la vita il mio ruolo di oggi lho gi coperto lanno scorso quando cassano era squalificato mi piace ho cercato di dare fastidio a stankovic che infatti ha superato la met campo due o tre volte e poi venuto anche il gol che una ciliegina
9225777 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me
9225778 but i understand youve got to choose sides either north or south
9225779 you go to take batting practice and the rats are bigger than pigs out there
9225780 you want to take a look i think the rats are lifting weights
9225781 if you can believe everything ozzie says then i guess you should be i havent seen any rats around here to be honest with you
9225782 in the years when neither team was really going anyplace this is all you had to talk about all year
9225783 right now most people are focused on winning the division and getting to the world series
9225784 you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there people arent watching the game its not serious
9225785 i know him as a man that answers straight questions with straight answers
9225786 and hes been a sox fan since before he was a senator like most fans whenever i see him he wants to know if we have enough pitching
9225787 a couple months ago when he asked that question i told him pitching is like votes you can never be comfortable you have enough
9225788 its always been a dream for me to play pro football but when i was in canadian college i had my eyes on the cfl but i didnt think i could get a spot on an nfl team just to be here and have a spot on the practice roster is truly amazing
9225789 im really happy how this turned out i cant wait to get the season started
9225790 im happy about the money but im just glad im playing professional football in the nfl so right now money is just a plus
9225791 i was pretty confident coming out of the last game
9225792 i had a good feeling about how things would work out
9225793 we are pursuing what opportunities are available with nfl teams for now
9225794 the final cuts to the 53 man is today and first game is next week so it may be a few weeks but you never know
9225795 its tough to say how long as nfl teams pick up players through even the end of the season as well as for futures contracts at the end of the season for following season
9225796 the adversity that came toward me this year started in spring training and never quit it just pounded me all year
9225797 it was a dream come true and my life turned 180 degrees in one night
9225798 i think sometimes when things arent working at this level teams really can make you pay
9225799 but at the same time when it turns around and it clicks it can be pretty good
9225800 i cant say i blame them if they dont bring me back up this year because i didnt do what i had to do this year
9225801 the way we view him and how we value him hasnt changed
9225802 the biggest thing for a player is to learn what their abilities are and what are their limits and to make the adjustments with the lines
9225803 for all his struggles hes had this year hes actually a better pitcher than he was last year

9225814 the choice is now between a future with a damaged world and a future with a severely damage world
9225815 we are risking the ability of the human race to survive
9225816 it always helps when i dont make a lot of errors
9225817 i couldnt have asked for more except probably another gold in beijing
9225818 obviously i tried to win the singles too but it didnt work out but id much rather share that triumph with a team member and then with my sister than anything else
9225819 i think that definitely the wimbledon win helped me a lot to change my mentality to realize not every thing had to be perfect all the time now if i dont have a perfect practice i know i can play i think that helps me to relax
9225820 i would have loved if we could have met in the finals
9225821 my biggest worry is shes so good im thinking about how im going to get past her
9225822 wake boarding is kind of like snow boarding on water
9225823 its a really big sport in the southern states and is beginning to gain popularity here
9225824 its definitely harder to stay on the board while being pulled by a boat but its fun and more relaxing than wake boarding
9225825 he saved some money and asked if we could help out
9225826 we told him to find a place negotiate a lease and we went from there
9225827 people would come from out of state just to ride it
9225828 i was setting up the pro shop at the marina i was working at and all the merchandise fell off the walls i got screamed at and realized i would never work for anyone again
9225829 eddie obriens restaurant buffalo chicken fingers with loaded fries are probably the closest thing to nirvana ever

9225846 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex here in beijing organisers have realised that such prohibitions are about as useful as banning breathing and have instead handed out thousands of free condoms to the athletes

9225859 the month of ramadhan in which the quran was revealed is guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion between right and wrong so whoever of you sights the crescent on the first night of the month of ramadhan he must fast that month and whoever is ill or on in a state of travelling then the missed days must be made up from other days allah intends for you ease and not difficulty he wants that you complete the number of days and glorify him for having guided you and that you may be thankful to him
9225860 i heard abu hurairah may allah be pleased with him say the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam said or he said abu al qasim sallallahu alayhi wasallam said fast when you see it and break your fast when you see it and if you cannot see it then complete 30 days of shaban

9225886 we are all bound to suffer from those of us who wish to aggress against their fellow men let us then solve this problem of crime by handing all of our weapons to the jones family over there by giving all of our ultimate power to settle disputes to that family in that way with their monopoly of coercion and of ultimate decision making the jones family will be able to protect each of us from each other
9225887 the system of extralegal voluntary courts has progressed hand in hand with a body of private law the rules of the state are circumvented by the same process that circumvents the forums established for the settlement of disputes over those rules in short a private agreement between two people a bilateral law has supplanted the official law the writ of the sovereign has ceased to run and for it is substituted a rule tacitly or explicitly agreed to by the parties
9225888 if an arbitrator can choose to ignore a penal damage rule or the status of limitations applicable to the claim before him and it is generally conceded that he has that power arbitration can be viewed as a practically revolutionary instrument for self liberation from the law
9225889 the merchants courts were voluntary and if a man ignored their judgment he could not be sent to jail nevertheless it is apparent that their decisions were generally respected even by the losers otherwise people would never have used them in the first place merchants made their courts work simply by agreeing to abide by the results the merchant who broke the understanding would not be sent to jail to be sure but neither would he long continue to be a merchant for the compliance exacted by his fellows provide if anything more effective than physical coercion

9225899 i think its about sara noel can put things in a down to earth way that goes right to the core
9225900 noel literally just played it the night before it was recorded did a little one man band job played the drums the bass the guitar sung it and came back up the stairs
9225901 if im to fall would you be there to applaud
9225902 its really hearfelt theres a melancholy there and thats whats liams showing
9225903 the oldest song on the album originally demoed for heathen chemistry wouldnt have made the album but the bass is so heavy it forced its way onto the final cut
9225904 three chords one note krautpop the kind of song ive wanted to write for years
9225905 it was just a groove a bassline and noel was like thats the one write some words for it its a stream of consciousness and theres no guitars on it which is another thing i like as well
9225906 liam wanted it to sound like the who with ginger baker on drums playing while a fight was happening
9225907 it was written at an odd time in my life when my marriage had run its course i taught noel the guitar parts and then let him roll with it gem played bass on it i dont play on it at all i wanted to make sure that it sounded right in the control room where it was being played
9225908 the coral said to noel thats a top tune so noel said whats this and i said i havent got a clue it was an old liam song i demoed with him around 2004 or 2005 and couldnt remember

9225920 it was no more status quo no more politics as usual it was all about change so then to see that obama literally part of his campaign uses those themes even new energy change all that i think o k well we were a little bit ahead on that
9225921 somethings kind of changing here in alaska too for being such a red state on the presidential level
9225922 what is it exactly that the v p does every day
9225923 the g o p leader of the state we havent spoken since i got elected
9225924 i guess if you take the individual issues two that i believe would be benchmarks showing whether youre a hard core republican conservative or not would be im a lifetime member of the n r a but this is alaska who isnt and i am pro life absolutely
9225925 i guess that puts me in a box of being hard core republican
9225926 the democrats also preach individual freedoms and individual rights capitalism free market let it do its thing best let people keep as much of their money that they earn as possible and when it comes to like the party machine no one will accuse me of being partisan
9225927 turning maybe purple in the state means to me its more independent its not the obsessive partisanship that gets in the way of doing whats right for this state and i think on a national level thats what were gonna see
9225928 thats why mccain is the candidate for the g o p because hes been known as the maverick as the conduit for some change
9225929 i always looked at senator mccain just as a joe blow public member looking from the outside in
9225930 hes been buttin heads with republicans for years and thats a healthy place to be
9225931 im a mom and my son is going to get deployed in september and we better have a real clear plan for this war and it better not have to do with oil and dependence on foreign energy
9225932 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9225933 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
9225934 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
9225935 we in alaska feel that crunch and are taking steps to address it right here at home
9225936 this is a tool that must be on the table to buy us time until our long term energy plans can be put into place we have already enjoyed the support of alaska senator ted stevens and it is gratifying to see senator obama get on board

9225961 permission was not sought or granted nor would it have been given
9225962 honor my contract elite xc wants to talk about honoring the contract how about when elite xc honored the contract and my pay to fight edson berto went down after i lost my first fight that was not part of my contract or how about the contract gary shaw breached by not promoting my boxing career gary shaw only gave me one out of four of the agreed upon fights i have not boxed for over a year when i signed with elite xc i was promised they would promote both my boxing and mma careers i could have signed with another mma only company but i wanted to box too
9225963 elite xc does me a favor after i lose by putting me on the first shoxc against edson berto bertos father is good friends with jareds father gary shaw who wants bertos brother on a boxing contract berto was the next guy elite xc wanted to build but i win that fight and now i am 1 1 elite xc gives me an opportunity to fight diaz elite xc puts me against diaz because elite xcs roster was so light and there was nobody else to fight him elite xc creates a new weight class for diaz because he beat gomi giving diaz a belt and creating a weight division 160 he can make will make your belt legit sorry to ruin elite xcs plans and beat him elite xc never promoted or took care of me as their champion
9225964 in the elite xcs dvd where diaz and i fought there are two 2 baseball cards of diaz and kimbo hello i won the fight and elite xcs promoting diaz after i beat him or how about the day elite xc flew diaz in to do a signing on the dvd where he lost wow that must have been uncomfortable nick signing a dvd and it is a fight that you lost why wasnt i flown in for the signing elite xc has never promoted me on either of their websites elitexc or pro elite elite xc offered me a fight on the first cbs show but only if i signed a new long term contract instead of promoting their best fighters on cbs you have to be on a long term contract for them to promote you that was not our deal
9225965 consider when elite xc gives a couple thousand tickets away at their cbs show in stockton elite xc gives me a hard time about comping me one extra ticket for my cousin that helped me train for my fight i only get four tickets per show i am the main event in honolulu my home town i did not ask for any tickets for my family and friends and they gave me a hard time about one extra ticket or how about when elite xc brought diaz into the ring after my last victory in hawaii to disrespect me and my family
9225966 chuck champion president elite xc threatens me my family and my manager with lawsuits and how hes going to sue me haha pretty hard to sue a guy who does not make jack with your company im glad kala disclosed how much i make which breached the confidentiality clause of the contract i will break down the real numbers for you i am the defending world champ i have been the main event for elite xc three out of four times on showtime in almost two years i have made approximately 83 000 after paying my trainers and managers fee i have 50 000 thousand after taxes probably 30 grand divide that by two years for 15 000 thousand a year divide by 52 weeks that amounts to approximately 300 a week i do not know anybody that can survive on that amount of money my buddies make more money than that in a couple days being a bus boy or bar back and yes you can argue i should fight more elite xc doesnt give me fights or promote me they ice me gary shaw productions only gave me one of the agreed upon four fights per the boxing contract and i do not want to ramble on about all the little small stuff that i can keep going on about but the straw that broke the camels back is they want me to fight diaz for the second time diaz is not the number one contender and they are paying diaz three times more money than me diaz complained after the stockton fight he was not paid enough how do you think that made me feel yes you can argue that diaz gets more for the draw therefore i do not deserve as much compensation if that is the case it is a result of elite xc terrible job promoting me instead of promoting me as their champ and upcoming athlete elite xc has resented me for ruining their plans to make diaz their champ that is just total disrespect so it comes down to money and what is fair i am tired of being bent over by elite xc with no vaseline
9225967 i am right when i say diaz is not the number one contender elite xc is trying to force this fight for their ratings eddie alaverez is the number one contender and anybody with half a brain knows that a fight with eddie is a way harder fight for me than diaz i will fight diaz but elite has to be fair im not ducking diaz why the hell would i be scared of someone i already beat with that being said i am going to focus on my boxing career i can make more money doing 6 and 8 rounders every other month and make more than i did being the elite xc defending world champ at least i will be able to sleep at night and be able to look myself in the mirror everyday that right there is worth more than 300 bucks a week or fighting a guy i cannot stand for less money than him the second time around will the diaz fight happen yes will the fight happen on elite xc on october 4 2008 probably not the way things are being run by chuck champion a guy whose history is newspapers not fighting and kala someone who talks a lot of game but has never put on a pair of gloves never stepped in a ring or cage kala has had everything handed to him with a silver spoon from daddy does anyone else but me think kala just wants to be famous and stir up all this dirty laundry i guess any publicity is good publicity when i think about it it has been good promotion for their october card since nobody is talking about it until you bring up the noons vs diaz match up
9225968 i hope that you can keep the worst parts of the past behind you and still embrace the fun memories that we did have the negitive side of our nature always tell us that they are out to get us maybe we really did do it it all to ourselves and the joke is on us

9225970 sono sempre dalla parte dei calciatori se vogliono andarsene giusto che il club li lasci andare il mercato una forma di schiavismo
9225971 sei uno schiavo se lavori senza contratto o se non vieni pagato
9225972 ma dai non credo sia gay solo un dannato tuffatore che si guadagna un fottio di calci di punizione e rigori ingannando gli arbitri anche se c da dire che incassa pure un sacco di botte e non tutelato come dovrebbe comunque non sar mai un suo fan
9225973 ha cominciato questa storia dicendo tutti sanno cosa voglio cio questa fighetta non riesce nemmeno a tirare fuori le palle per dire chiaramente quello che vuole
9225974 che lo vendano pure non solo non degno di indossare la maglia dello united ma nemmeno di baciarmi il culo
9225975 non lo voglio pi vedere il modo in cui si comportato costituisce unoffesa per noi e per tutti i giocatori del manchester presenti e passati in special modo per un galantuomo come
9225976 vendete quella puttana anzi sapete cosa vi dico se ronaldo fosse un giocattolo lo romperei prima di scambiarlo con qualche amico
9225977 disgustoso non mi meraviglia il fatto che una testa cos grossa contenga cos tante cazzate spero che la sua carriera al real sar disastrosa in pi di quarantanni da tifoso dello united non ho mai visto un calciatore venire disprezzato in questo modo da coloro che prima lo adoravano
9225978 non riesco a ricordare un giocatore dei diavoli rossi cos sleale dai tempi di uhm fammi pensare di giuda heinze difensore argentino passato dal manchester al real con una trattativa lampo nda anzi sapete che vi dico spero che proprio heinze gli spezzi una gamba in allenamento cos per giustizia karmika
9225979 da un pezzo che vado predicando linutilit di quellegoista irriconoscente marmocchio arraffa soldi
9225980 non mi piace nemmeno come giocatore genio in abbondanza per carit ma poca voglia di sudare
9225981 ok guardiamo i lati positivi di questo trasferimento 1 il morale della squadra sinnalzer a dismisura 2 rooney render al massimo non essendo pi costretto a sacrificarsi a fare la seconda punta per pompare lego di quel bamboccio 3 un sacco di soldi freschi in cassa da utilizzare per rinforzare la squadra o saldare i debiti 4 pi opportunit sui calci piazzati che vengono battuti quasi sempre da quellarrogante con percentuali realizzative molto basse mentre ora potranno tirarli anche hargreaves e altri 5 giovani come anderson e nani avranno in squadra modelli migliori da imitare come giggs
9225982 non desidero egomaniaci nella mia squadra del cuore noi siamo il manchester united non il real

9226000 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9226001 were not going to get into specifics today but we have plans for all possibilities
9226002 we continue to closely monitor the movement of the storm and are considering necessary contingencies the safety of our affected delegations is our first priority and preparing for gustav comes before anything else

9226007 im supposed to be leaving but i keep waiting just a little longer to see what the storm is going to do i know its a risk
9226008 o ur conviction is that birth and adoption are the purview of married heterosexual couples traditional marriage is gods design for the family and is rooted in biblical truth when that divine plan is implemented children have the best opportunity to thrive thats why public policy as it relates to families must be based not solely on the desires of adults but rather on the needs of children and what is best for society at large

9226025 turkmenistan considers russia its good friend and strategic partner and intends to develop a constructive dialogue

9226030 im extremely happy to be heading to tampa bay and i cant wait to take advantage of this opportunity we should have a great team and i cannot wait to get started
9226031 it got to a point where the money was too much for what we wanted to pay
9226032 we thought we had made a considerable offer but when there was the threat of an offer sheet at such an exaggerated dollar amount it really led us to believe that making a deal was an easier way and would give us the return that we needed for this player

9226040 i rode well and rode hard and im happy to have this experience on this course for next year it was very demanding and had a lot good technical challenges to it
9226041 the more i race the more i learn to race well and achieve that consistency plus i go into races knowing i can get a top three rather than hoping for it
9226042 i think anybody whos honest about it knows that were weaker than we were at the last convention
9226043 in 04 our prospects were a whole lot different were a little bit on the downside
9226044 this is how you strengthen the party these are really the movers and the shakers who are involved in the party
9226045 many of the key people in republican politics will be there and this will be a week for them to get to know each other and this is a week to really come together theyll be able to come together and talk about how to rebuild the party
9226046 it does galvanize your grass roots operation and theyre out canvassing and turning out the vote for the top of the ticket

9226052 i learned theres a lot more courage and clarity within me than i wouldve guessed
9226053 i remember being aware of needing to help people and instantly going there and beginning to pull people out of cars i was really overcome with a sense of connection how easy it was to connect with people
9226054 fairfax claims these cuts are about adapting to new technologies and platforms but the way to deal with these changes is to increase the size of newsrooms and compete on the quality of news
9226055 further reducing newsrooms will only mean more of their already overworked journalists will struggle to give properly researched treatment to their stories and as a result their readers will not get the information they need to make informed decisions in their day to day lives
9226056 that this is happening in an election year is particularly disturbing as this is a time in which people need the best information possible to make important decisions about the future of new zealand
9226057 a strong and well resourced fourth estate is a vital part of a functioning democracy but today fairfax dealt a blow to all new zealanders
9226058 fairfaxs proposed redundancies will be a huge blow to already strained newsrooms and to new zealanders democratic right to be properly informed about their countrys major issues

9226085 we have been for the last six weeks or so i dont want to say weve been in experimental mode but weve been very open to other ideas
9226086 we didnt feel like we were six weeks ago locked in the chase by any means but we did feel like we needed to improve no matter how much we test its hard to simulate being at a race track so weve been very much off of what we would consider our baseline stuff trying to find stuff
9226087 but it was not necessarily because of our points situation because we werent locked in when we kind of took that we gambled a little bit saying weve got to be willing to finish 30th running bad to go try to find a better way to run so weve been kind of in that mode for the past six or eight weeks

9226104 suppliers require between 30 to 90 days customer termination notice to switch contract many businesses dont realise this and are leaving it too late to find a more competitive alternative energy prices have increased by more than 100 over the past year alone and are still on the rise there is a clear financial imperative to test the market in an attempt to mitigate cost increases
9226105 some businesses are panicked by the prospect of terminating their contract in the belief that their supply will be prematurely cut off we would advise them to serve notice while they consider their options even if the best deal at the end of the day is to re contract with their existing supplier at least this gives them the time to test the market without fear of being locked into an uncompetitive contract

9226112 the allusion is to the concurrence or harmony of these two attributes of god the word just applied to god means that he asserts just claims and inflicts just punishment this determines the character of the atonement such language would be unmeaning if it were not admitted that the atonement is in the proper sense of the word a satisfaction of divine justice and when the apostle adds that he might be just and the justifier he alludes to the fact that these two apparently conflicting perfections justice and grace meet in full harmony on the cross justice suffers no violence and grace has full outlet
9226113 he declares his righteousness first in the propitiation itself it appears or is made apparent that he hates sin when nothing less than the blood of christ would satisfy for it finding sin though but imputed upon his own son he did not spare him because he had made himself sin for us secondly he declares his righteousness in the pardon upon that propitiation it is now become not only an act of grace and mercy but an act of righteousness in god to pardon the sins of penitent believers having accepted the satisfaction that christ by dying made to his justice for them he is just that is faithful to his word

9226119 estimamos en poco m s de 14 900 el n mero de desaparecidos y la cifra puede aumentar
9226120 de los 14 900 casos hemos verificado 13 721 casos y nos falta hacer lo mismo con una relaci n de m s de 1 000 nuevos casos de desaparecidos en poder de la defensor a que han sido sumados
9226121 indica que hay una tendencia al alza y que el n mero de desaparecidos es much simo mayor
9226122 hay cifras que vienen de diferentes fuentes se habla de entre 13 000 y 15 000 personas desaparecidas a ra z del conflicto armado
9226123 ese es uno de los problemas fundamentales en el pa s donde no existe una instituci n que permita centralizar informaci n sobre desaparecidos y seguir este tema para dar respuesta y confianza
9226124 es muy posible que el total de desaparecidos se siga incrementando y supere los 15 000 porque la cifra de desaparecidos de la cvr era provisional
9226125 nuestras cifras son proyecciones y stas incluyen a los nuevos casos de desaparecidos que est n siendo denunciados no aumenta el total de v ctimas
9226126 aun falta cruzar cifras y comparar listas de desaparecidos la defensor a ha verificado 950 casos nuevos y estamos evaluando m s de 2 800 solicitudes

9226163 i have long believed that we ought to make a home for pro life democrats
9226164 i think we need to talk about this issue differently
9226165 the republicans have painted us as a pro abortion party i dont know anybody in america who is pro abortion
9226166 we do have to have a big tent i do think we need to welcome pro life democrats into this party
9226167 in 2004 we couldnt get a word in this time they reached out to us
9226168 and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion
9226169 also strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
9226170 help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
9226171 this platform for the first time acknowledges and supports a decision to exercise choice in a different direction to carry a child to term
9226172 the core value a womans right to choose has not been compromised at all
9226173 i know people see it as a rollback i dont think it is its the possibility of common ground
9226174 can the democrats count votes there are millions of votes at stake here
9226175 it turns out the women of america arent finished yet
9226176 there are going to be some really fascinating conversations that are going to come up around gender in some ways that nobody expected
9226177 we dont take that lightly we just dont think he has a message we dont think hes good for women
9226178 i think the democratic party took women for granted in the primary they didnt step on sexism when they should have and i cant support them
9226179 the fact that he went out on a limb to pick a woman im very impressed by that
9226180 it doesnt make sense to me that frankly emilys list didnt hold them accountable for having been elected on that platform but then not supporting that platform
9226181 the setback for the pro choice movement is almost deserved
9226182 if 18 million votes is not enough what does it take in the democratic party to get a woman on the ticket
9226183 anger definitely bargaining well o k and depression thats definitely what i was going through
9226184 even after we had our little kumbaya meeting with senator obama i wasnt doing well
9226185 i think that makes it doubly hard for some of these women because she really did look presidential
9226186 is a move for the women who werent at the convention
9226187 sarah palin alaska gov mccains v p pick kind of a babe
9226188 this raises the question of when where and how often women vote out of anger because theres sexism
9226189 we did not see a big benefit for her from the gender gap
9226190 this says again you cant take these women for granted
9226191 theres going to be a need to really reach out to them to highlight the difference between john mccain and barack obama on the issues women care about

9226238 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining whos of presidential caliber
9226239 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9226240 it would be one thing if she had only been governor for a year and a half but prior to that she had not had major experience in public life

9226248 bowdoins emergency motion is not just irrelevant to the emergency relief he requests but utter nonsense bowdoin says that he has hired a lawyer named gerald nehra who fashions himself as the countrys foremost expert in refuting ponzi schemes to prove that asd was not one remarkably bowdoin attaches an affidavit from this lawyer to the very same pleading in which bowdoin says that his customers will evaporate unless he is permitted to pay them with the funds they supposedly paid him for advertising
9226249 in this ponzi model the host generates most if not all of its funding from membership fees and therefore must use money received from later advertisers to pay rebates and referral fees to earlier advertisers these programs collapse when new membership fees fail to cover the payouts promised to existing members
9226250 faye and i receive letters every day from all the members or a lot of the members telling what asd has done for them now they dont know what theyll do they say they dont have any other avenues today we had one from someone in a wheelchair and they were making about 50 a day it was keeping them in their apartment it was helping them to purchase the prescription drugs that they needed and now it looks like they may be put out on the street so folks it has hurt a lot of people
9226251 this is an attack of satan because we were helping tens of thousands of people around the world but we are more than sic overcomers and we get our strength from god and with god all things are possible and were on our way to a miracle folks i believe beyond a shadow of a doubt that well be back in business stronger than ever itll take all the doubts away from all these people about being a ponzi because itll be proven that we are not a ponzi

9226299 russia completely lost the information war in the first few days
9226300 then they realised the mistake and hit back they rolled out the general staff and then these interviews by medvedev
9226301 they have done better than they used to but they have a very long way to go
9226302 yes naturally certain conclusions will be made from this situation
9226303 practice has shown that a confrontation in such situations is not limited to armed conflict and diplomatic battles but is carried through into the communications sphere
9226304 unlike the georgian side which has been praised by some for a successful information campaign russia had not prepared for this war and was concerned above all not with the polemics of saakashvili but with the defence of its citizens
9226305 in this information war we still have much to do we have already spoken about this and we have received some very serious experience in the current situation
9226306 i want to tell you something very clear dont worry about american pressure on israel we the jewish people control america and the americans know it
9226307 arabs will get their freedom only when the americans get theirs from israel lobby
9226308 the zionist power configurations primary loyalty is to the state of israel and its policy is designed to colonize the us congress to the benefit of mother country israel

9226328 six of the 12 hybrids we looked at can save you from about 500 to 4 250 even without tax credits and pay back their price premium after only one year they are the toyota prius and hybrid versions of the chevrolet malibu and tahoe ford escape saturn vue and toyota camry for several you can save even more by taking advantage of federal tax credits

9226337 we dont want to try to emulate beijing what we want is new ways of thinking about the opening ceremony
9226338 we want the whole of london to be involved with different parts of london taking part in the ceremony the london games must be deeply democratic with the citys citizens feeling theyre intimately involved
9226339 i think what you will see is a very vivid sense of celebration right across the city at both the opening and closing ceremonies
9226340 in terms of great organisation fantastic facilities and a welcoming attitude and pride among the people beijing was superb
9226341 but there are things we can and will do better
9226342 i saw lots and lots of chinese people standing outside stadiums on the wrong part of a perimeter fence as observers rather than participants we must reverse that trend and make sure our olympics are more accessible
9226343 i also want to minimise the number of empty seats in stadiums which frustrate the public and keep them at a distance for no reason
9226344 and i want our volunteers to be trained better and given a more clearly defined role
9226345 we want to create the expectation that seats will have people on them you cant stop sponsors buying seats nor should you but we must maximise the publics chances of seeing the games first hand
9226346 im just getting fitter playing the end of that backline makes it a bit easier i didnt have to do a great deal for those tries
9226347 just a couple of opportunist tries when you play outside matt cooper and guys like mark gasnier it makes it easier everyone is rolling along
9226348 hes definitely not the dell of six years ago but hes contributing really well hes getting fitter and his positional play is very good
9226349 the second half against brisbane and the last two weeks our attack has been the best its been probably since matty head trent barrett and luke bailey and all those blokes its definitely been our best since 2006
9226350 we knew if we stuck with them they wouldnt be able to stick with us were just happy with the way we started and a few of them threw in the towel
9226351 defensively we were poor all across the side usually we get three or four in tackles tonight we were ones and twos
9226352 were a much better side than what we showed tonight and we probably played one of our worst games in a few weeks at the wrong time
9226353 it was a very important game for us and we blew it
9226354 i came here to pick up my daughter because in this area the flooding can get up to your chest
9226355 we do forecast it to reach category 5 but whether it is a category 4 or 5 it is extremely dangerous either way
9226356 were hoping that its going to settle down enough that we can do some damage assessment

9226364 i am not a white supremacist nor have i ever referred to myself as a white supremacist i am simply a person who stands up for the rights and heritage of european americans just as thousands of other politicians openly promote what they see as the interest of their own people a perfect example is mr dinerstein who is a member of many jewish organizations that unashamedly support what they perceive as jewish interests and the interests of the jewish state of israel
9226365 it is a crying shame he said that as a young man of 19 believing in american freedom and rights that i have to fight so hard to simply be sworn in to my duly elected seat simply because my views are at odds with another of this public body it is my hope that every american even those who dont share all my opinions support the upholding of the most important principles of freedom in the american process and assist me in being seated in my hard won post as an elected official

9226381 i bow at your feet o my dear brother please have pity have pity on this innocent child i i beseech you for an innocent life
9226382 but i cannot allow emotions to overtake me after all it is a question of my own survival daibikis children must die no theres no sin in it no sin at all in self protection
9226383 i think in the whole mahabharata you will not find another character who can match kangs in cruelty
9226384 just to save own life so many innocent lives were slaughtered its horrible how could they imagine such a psychic character
9226385 the director has done a good job look this horrible action was thankfully not shown in too much of detail it was suggested by only few blood stains

9226397 he called my son jv and told him that he wanted to meet me
9226398 according to him lozada the one who has a franchise with him was the black and white movement but he is severing his ties with them
9226399 the black and white movement said that there will be no politician in the rally and they acted like they are the only righteous people in the world now look at whats happening
9226400 during the big rally in makati last feb 29 they forced president cory aquino to go up the stage and address the crowd as a gentleman i escorted her to the stage i also escorted her when she was going down the stairs it was then that mayor binay held my hand and asked me to give a few words to the crowd then the following day they bwm attacked me
9226401 the sharing of knowledge experiences and best practices as well as the emergence of trans boundary and inter generational leadership are critical in addressing grave social problems
9226402 crucial as well is the emergence of collective leadership across boundaries and the need to develop inter generational leadership
9226403 to bring individual and collective efforts in asia to a higher plane of responsive social involvement
9226404 innovative schemes for partnership in this area will be pursued particularly in the local level initiatives and not just the conventional nationally led macro types of program
9226405 we look forward to a meaningful observance of this years ramadan may its essence instill in our hearts and minds the need for us to be more united and stronger in our effort to foster lasting peace and sustainable development in mindanao moro communities and the autonomous region in muslim mindanao

9226409 education is the great equalizer even if you were born here but you have attained education chances are great that you can uplift your family from poverty and give them a better life
9226410 it is part of our live learn and thrive llt program we ensure that children live by giving them the places the tools and programs they need to learn and give them access to programs that develop their self esteem and the life skills they need to thrive

9226415 the problem is not with recruitment but with winning we have presidential candidates but the problem is that theyre not winnable this is not to say that theyre not qualified and competent but they are not popular
9226416 we can always adopt candidates from other parties thats not a first time we did that with gma who was kampi president before
9226417 as early as the time of former speaker jdv he has been saying lets work first
9226418 unlike the others the vice president is not yet tied to any party
9226419 i hope they will just talk but i really cant tell because they are the candidates
9226420 but it is better if they will not fight each other so that our group will remain intact i dont think it will affect the friendship but that is what senator pangilinan and i feel that they should talk
9226421 in politics anything can happen and it is pregnant with possibilities hindi natin alam we may be enemies today but friends tomorrow
9226422 are senators francis chiz escudero loren legarda manny villar or mar roxas opposition i want to correct the misconception that if you are criticizing the president or her government you are automatically opposition
9226423 we have an open door policy we believe that this country needs to unite and not divide our people the politicians especially when politicians reason and bargain with one another and not speak in forked tongues we can all get together as one
9226424 political parties such as the np which are supportive of the administrations programs and policies are welcome to become part of the administration alliance in 2010 and beyond
9226425 we envision one solid and strong republic with one strong administration party starting with the two largest lakas and kampi but never to the exclusion of our other allies who are supportive of the administrations programs and policies
9226426 im still very positive that we can have this merger although i am not discounting the possibility that some areas in the local level will remain a free zone on the overall ill be very happy if we can achieve a 95 percent success rate at uniting the local leaders including rival groups who are either with lakas or kampi
9226427 of course we will also consider other administration allies as part of a super alliance that we intend to have in 2010
9226428 i hope they will just talk but i really cant tell because they are the candidates
9226429 but it is better if they will not fight each other so that our group will remain intact i dont think it will affect the friendship but that is what senator pangilinan and i feel that they should talk
9226430 we are in a period of a pronounced slowdown that will probably last until 2010

9226432 at no moment did spanair indicate that it was its intention to substitute the plane
9226433 informed the airport of the possibility of replacing the aircraft but eventually decided to stick with the aircraft that crashed
9226434 after an initial evaluation of the detected glitch and the estimated time for its repair maintenance technicians decided that it would not be necessary to switch planes as it was a minor repair that would take no more than 15 minutes
9226435 politkovskaya was the heart of russia its the regime that killed her
9226436 there is no detailed schedule yet but i can confirm it wont start in september
9226437 the biggest difference between the train and other trains would be the special sightseeing car where commodious windows and comfortable chairs allowed passengers a better view of the scenery
9226438 im enjoying the challenge and im delighted to still have a sniff
9226439 ollies favourite but ill see if i can make him sweat a bit
9226440 its a big day the culmination of a years worth of golf comes down to one day i played wonderfully and made nothing the longest putt was the five footer on the last
9226441 i played like eight or nine under golf not four under i needed a good score to keep the dream alive and i achieved that but i need a great one tomorrow
9226442 is there any reason why you have to look in the mirror at yourself while you brush your teeth
9226443 with the little injuries from tuesdays match it was difficult
9226444 we had a lot of errors ten or 12 during the first 20 minutes so it was hard to maintain the pressure but we won the match which is everything
9226445 during the first matches of the season its normal to have mistakes but whats worrying me is that they are the same as against dax
9226446 today i served very well i have more confidence and i hope continuing to improve my tennis i know i have to keep improving my tennis if i want to win
9226447 i have to play very well if i want to win
9226448 i will just focus on my next match because every match is difficult hes playing very well
9226449 he was putting serves bang on the line i really didnt get any rhythm i just kept fighting once i broke him in the third set thats when i started to get my rhythm
9226450 this is why you put in all the work hopefully i can keep it going
9226451 that gave me a lot of confidence that i could win
9226452 he was playing well in that moment but after that i started playing better and he made some mistakes
9226453 ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9226454 i can go out there and rip away i have nothing to lose pretty much its just step up and rip it
9226455 i felt like i had to play my game serve huge and that served me well
9226456 she is very consistent it always helps when i dont make a lot of errors
9226457 we want to feel safe in the mexico of the future
9226458 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9226459 senator mccain has not only succeed in unifying our party but also succeeded in generating enormous enthusiasm whereas the democrats are against all odds still struggling to pull their base together
9226460 so this is the future of the republican party you are looking at a future in which national security has bumped down the list of priorities behind abortion politics gender politics and energy politics
9226461 ms palin is a bold pick and probably a shrewd one its not nearly so clear that she is a responsible pick or a wise one
9226462 her executive experience consists of less than two years as governor of her sparsely populated state plus six years as mayor of wasilla pop 8 471
9226463 i would put governor palins credentials up versus senator obama any day of the week
9226464 she has executive experience she has a much greater understanding of the international oil markets and she certainly has the qualifications to be president
9226465 it is a spectacular beginning but in 7 7 kilometres you cant take very important leads in the general standings
9226466 we dont want to try to emulate beijing what we want is new ways of thinking about the opening ceremony
9226467 we want the whole of london to be involved with different parts of london taking part in the ceremony the london games must be deeply democratic with the citys citizens feeling theyre intimately involved
9226468 i think what you will see is a very vivid sense of celebration right across the city at both the opening and closing ceremonies
9226469 in terms of great organisation fantastic facilities and a welcoming attitude and pride among the people beijing was superb
9226470 but there are things we can and will do better
9226471 i saw lots and lots of chinese people standing outside stadiums on the wrong part of a perimeter fence as observers rather than participants we must reverse that trend and make sure our olympics are more accessible
9226472 i also want to minimise the number of empty seats in stadiums which frustrate the public and keep them at a distance for no reason
9226473 and i want our volunteers to be trained better and given a more clearly defined role
9226474 we want to create the expectation that seats will have people on them you cant stop sponsors buying seats nor should you but we must maximise the publics chances of seeing the games first hand
9226475 im just getting fitter playing the end of that backline makes it a bit easier i didnt have to do a great deal for those tries
9226476 just a couple of opportunist tries when you play outside matt cooper and guys like mark gasnier it makes it easier everyone is rolling along
9226477 hes definitely not the dell of six years ago but hes contributing really well hes getting fitter and his positional play is very good
9226478 the second half against brisbane and the last two weeks our attack has been the best its been probably since matty head trent barrett and luke bailey and all those blokes its definitely been our best since 2006
9226479 we knew if we stuck with them they wouldnt be able to stick with us were just happy with the way we started and a few of them threw in the towel
9226480 defensively we were poor all across the side usually we get three or four in tackles tonight we were ones and twos
9226481 were a much better side than what we showed tonight and we probably played one of our worst games in a few weeks at the wrong time
9226482 i came here to pick up my daughter because in this area the flooding can get up to your chest
9226483 we do forecast it to reach category 5 but whether it is a category 4 or 5 it is extremely dangerous either way
9226484 were hoping that its going to settle down enough that we can do some damage assessment
9226485 im expecting the hms iron duke early and theyre going to be providing significant assistance in our damage assessment operations
9226486 it is all wet and i am afraid to sleep inside there
9226487 keeping up with your progress is always important if you want to know the state of your success sometimes you compare yourself to others and other times to yourself but in a weaker economy you must keep your comparisons to current situations in other words dont compare the current success of your business with how it was doing when the economy was better inevitably you will not be doing as well as you were and therefore be discouraged to move forward instead look at other similar businesses in the same economy to set your bar for success

9226492 theres nothing else like this magnifier http www firststreetonline com category jspid 41858 on the market and theres a huge need for it among our customer base of baby boomers and beyond
9226493 as baby boomers age they are encountering the daily indignities that accompany a downward slide in visual acuity and unlike their parents and grandparents they are not shy about expressing their displeasure prompting some companies to pay attention
9226494 a lot of us in the company fall into the baby boomer and beyond group
9226495 and believe me if we ever edge even slightly towards a depressing look we hear from our own staff about it staff members also often suggest products to us and are more than willing to try out new items before we agree to stock them
9226496 that declining vision problem is one in which we take special interest and i cant tell you how many magnifiers of all shapes sizes designs and powers we have tried out before arriving at the wide selection we now offer everything from small very discreet handheld styles lighted for restaurant menus or road maps to clip and flips that hook over regular glasses for hands free use to floor and desk lamp styles
9226497 i hope people will go to our web site and find out more
9226498 we know our baby boomer and beyond demographic has a need for this exceptional magnifier as well as others that we stock its a fine collection because weve put in the time to research and compare whats out there so we can offer firststreet customers the best and latest products available
9226499 with all the negative economic news soaring fuel costs and escalating food prices across the country this price reduction on one of our premium products should be welcome news
9226500 this is our way of easing the pinch on our regular customers while introducing this effective product to new consumers we are also happy to report that supplies of these fruits are sufficient to meet the growing demand over the next 12 months
9226501 we have successfully developed a process that preserves the properties of whole fruit without extracting compounds and without turning the fruit into a less potent powder
9226502 instead we are relying on mother natures formula as being the best way to benefit from the fruits inherent properties
9226503 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
9226504 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity
9226505 as the commission finds are necessary to diminish eliminate or prevent such burden
9226506 you want people to think well of you dont you
9226507 ive had a few calls but theres nothing out there that i dont think we can do better with than the guys in our own system
9226508 our bench is deep enough and our bullpen hasnt been getting enough work

9226510 teach both you know dont be afraid of education healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9226511 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class
9226512 im not going to pretend i know how all this came to be
9226513 its unfortunate mccain would pick someone who shares those particular anti science views but its not a surprise
9226514 shes a choice that pleases the religious right and the religious right has been the chief force against teaching evolution
9226515 in the direct sense vice presidents dont have much to do with what goes on in classrooms but a person whos a creationist doesnt understand science and technology at all
9226516 it doesnt bode well for science and doesnt bode well for interaction between science and government
9226517 i think its a mistake to try to cloud the teachings of science with theories that frankly dont hold up to scientific inquiry
9226518 im not going to pretend i know how all this came to be
9226519 well if it isnt vaccines then what the hell is causing the rise in autism rates
9226520 the release of carbon dioxide is massive in this country
9226521 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
9226522 seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9226523 the question for the american people is whether they can make this odyssey that democratic delegates to the convention made seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9226524 this is one emergency that we cant drill our way out of
9226525 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9226526 ms palin has made it clear through her actions that she is unwilling to do even as much as the bush administration to address the impacts of global warming
9226527 unfortunately with her support for drilling in the arctic refuge and off our coasts governor palin will simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil
9226528 in fact there is insufficient evidence that polar bears are in danger of becoming extinct within the foreseeable future the possible listing of a healthy species like the polar bear would be based on uncertain modeling of possible effects the center for biological diversity which petitioned for the polar bear to be protected wants the listing to force the government to either stop or severely limit any public or private action that produces or even allows the production of greenhouse gases such limits should be adopted through an open process in which environmental issues are weighed against economic and social needs and where scientists debate and present information that policy makers need to make the best decisions americans should become involved in the issue of climate change by offering suggestions for constructive action to their state governments but listing the polar bear as threatened is the wrong way to get to the right answer
9226529 we believe that the services decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available
9226530 completely ridiculous and a waste of the courts time this lawsuit and her head in the sand approach to global warming only helps oil companies certainly not alaska or the polar bear gov palin should be working for sustainable clean energy development in alaska instead of extinction for the polar bear
9226531 conserving energy and using it more efficiently doesnt necessarily mean you have to sacrifice your quality of life
9226532 its the little things like making sure lights computers and appliances are turned off and slowing down on the road which will save money spent on gasoline
9226533 ignoring the problem reflects a liberal live for today attitude unworthy of our great country
9226534 i need beaver pennsylvania i need you to stand up beside me and say now is the time to bring about change in america
9226535 i think its a myth that they have all this anger
9226536 to be honest as much as americans politics is a fun spectator sport i personally havent seen it significantly influence a campaign in canada
9226537 a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9226538 the broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w
9226539 a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours
9226540 because defenders of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9226541 cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9226542 set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9226543 same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
9226544 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief
9226545 with the nomination of sen barack obama tonight the man who will lead the democratic party in its march toward the white house we are making a down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
9226546 not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
9226547 right now in the second week of may 2006 we are facing perhaps the worst gas crisis in history
9226548 we have way too much gasoline gas is down to 19 cents a gallon and the oil companies are hurting i know that i am partly to blame by insisting that cars run on trash i am therefore proposing a federal bail out to our oil companies because hey if it were the other way around you know the oil companies would help us
9226549 i think he brought it to a new level of attention and validity that we hadnt had before
9226550 al gore has been warning us of the dangers of climate change for more than twenty years
9226551 when al won an academy award for his fine documentary an inconvenient truth i was thrilled america was finally listening to the lecture hed given me every week for eight years
9226552 he had written a great book before he was chosen as vice president
9226553 its easy to take shots its part of being a public figure and being in public office you catch a lot of arrows
9226554 al gore knew more about the importance of the rain forest than the scientists
9226555 i asked him a couple of questions and he began a tutorial flying 30 000 feet over the rain forest he told us how the important the rain forest was to the environment and how it affected weather patterns i didnt know that stuff it was one of those life changing moments that ill never forget
9226556 in four short years bush turned that around and we now have debt for years to come
9226557 right now we need to campaign on turning virginia from a red state to a blue state
9226558 im talking to people every day who were republicans forever but are just not able to do it this year
9226559 for years and years they bought the plan to cut taxes but the middle class now is beginning to catch up with that idea and understand that a trick has been pulled on them
9226560 i want to vote for somebody who is going to deliver what he says he is going to do
9226561 forget about the wealthy think about the people and help the middle class rather than the wealthy
9226562 we have got a good start but we have our work cut out for us all across the country
9226563 we need to bring the lost to the light and reap the harvest
9226564 this election if probably one of the most important of my grandchildrens lives
9226565 i think historically we have left behind the disadvantaged and the people the policy was developed for
9226566 i think obama has done things more than any candidate to reach out to my generation
9226567 compare that to john mccain who said he barely knew how to use the internet and had to have help from his wife
9226568 the campaign of barack obama and joe biden is a very exciting one
9226569 we want a change that is going to help us all
9226570 their strength is not only how they campaign but how they govern
9226571 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
9226572 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
9226573 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
9226574 as a follow up to my below post picking a female vp makes it very difficult for obama to execute the second part of his strategy painting mccain as the same as bush
9226575 maybe they wont notice that i am taking john mccains straight talk express campaign themes
9226576 i dont think so america knows mccain just sold out the country for a politic tactical stunt the woman has no experience on diversity of economics no national experience with any issue if the 72 year old kicks the bucket so would we as a country this woman is soooooo under qualified
9226577 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses
9226578 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9226579 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9226580 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9226581 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
9226582 i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
9226583 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
9226584 ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
9226585 and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
9226586 both candidates are talking about energy high prices and global warming so its important to look past the rhetoric and see what is at the heart of their plans
9226587 as this scorecard illustrates the contrast in this election could not be starker
9226588 barack obama wants to give tax relief and 1 000 energy rebates to working families while john mccain wants billions more in tax breaks for oil companies making more than 1 000 a second in profits
9226589 thats why i came here tonight to tell you why i feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
9226590 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9226591 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
9226592 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9226593 many scientists predict shockingly that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months during the first term of the next president
9226594 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions
9226595 in spite of john mccains past record of open mindedness and leadership on the climate crisis he has now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
9226596 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9226597 that america is the best country on earth and a place where everybody if they work hard can achieve great things
9226598 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
9226599 were corrupting more and more people to care about this stuff
9226600 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
9226601 because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change
9226602 hes said many times that the primary battle was historic and exciting and that in the end result it would be good for the democratic party that it would energize a lot of people and bring a lot of new people out
9226603 he expected all along that this would resolve itself elegantly and organically and it did
9226604 i think hes very happy with where we are we have a nominee a spectacular nominee and hes going to do everything he can to see him elected
9226605 we think gore can deliver a compelling message on both the economy and foreign policy as relates to energy
9226606 hes a messenger there are a lot of elected officials that voters dont readily accept information from and hes one that they do they think that hes got credibility he has some credibility because a lot of voters believe that if he were elected the last eight years would have been different
9226607 what he has said is that he is not interested in serving in a future administration but that he hasnt ruled out public office and that if he ran for office again it would probably be for president
9226608 he has found a very unique role and platform as a kind of public private citizen able to harness resources creatively to make a huge impact on the climate crisis
9226609 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 per cent of the time
9226610 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9226611 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9226612 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9226613 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own
9226614 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
9226615 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9226616 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9226617 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9226618 the experience lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9226619 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9226620 tonight we witness in part what has become of his dream the acceptance of a democratic presidential nominee decided not by the colour of his skin but by the content of his character
9226621 if one started to use biofuels and in reality that policy led to an increase in greenhouse gases rather than a decrease that would obviously be insane
9226622 a little trivia for you today ladies and gentlemen in seat 9b is the best chocolate chip cookie maker in the whole world
9226623 a president who ends the global scourge of aids in our time
9226624 the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9226625 but surely we can agree that our gay brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9226626 alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
9226627 dont expect much honesty transparency or accountability from climate armageddonites
9226628 observed climate change and the negligible global effect of greenhouse gas emission limits in the state of colorado
9226629 the system of modern capitalism will generate ever larger environmental consequences outstripping efforts to manage them
9226630 it is unimaginable that american politics as we know it will deliver the transformative changes needed
9226631 it really has nothing to do with his stand on global warming
9226632 hes a great faculty member hes an institution at csu
9226633 we must seize this opportunity to elect united states of america
9226634 if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis
9226635 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9226636 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of mankind
9226637 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
9226638 right now the united states imports about 70 of its oil from overseas at the same time billions of dollars that we spend on all that foreign oil seems to end up in the bank accounts of those around the world who are openly hostile to american values and our way of life this costly reliance on fossil fuels threatens america and the world in other ways too co2 emissions are increasing global temperatures sea levels are rising and storms are getting worse
9226639 borrowing money from china to buy oil from saudi arabia
9226640 borrow ing money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us
9226641 as i have said for many years throughout this land were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9226642 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9226643 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9226644 in a stadium like this it felt like one living organism
9226645 people are really going to see which venue looks more like america and its this one
9226646 he thoroughly and compellingly explained his plan for change with specific distinctions between what government should be responsible for and personal responsibility
9226647 we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
9226648 i cant imagine why youd have a hard time making up your mind
9226649 its important to understand how our democracy works not just looking on television but to participate is important to me
9226650 i believe we wouldnt be in iraq in his administration mcnally said
9226651 i think you get the handlers in there and you just get lost
9226652 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9226653 she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9226654 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade
9226655 the last thing women need is a president and vice president who are prepared to turn back the clock on womens rights and repeal the protections of roe v wade
9226656 when as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president and john mccain promises to appoint more scalias and thomases and end a womans right to choose it is time for a change
9226657 in an era when over 80 percent of downs syndrome babies are aborted the palins feel they have been extremely blessed by god to raise an absolutely perfect son
9226658 gov palin continues to use her testimony to advance protections for unborn children
9226659 will i get a nominee who will keep his word to me in the vetting process if any word is actually given
9226660 we all know that dance nobody actually admits they ask the roe question and the question doesnt get asked and it doesnt get answered and therefore the nominees get on the bench and they do what they want
9226661 wont even follow bin laden to the cave where he lives
9226662 weve been a band for 10 years and this is probably the coolest thing weve ever done
9226663 if god doesnt live in colorado at least thats where he spends most of his time
9226664 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9226665 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
9226666 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
9226667 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
9226668 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
9226669 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
9226670 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
9226671 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
9226672 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
9226673 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
9226674 and itll be a touch one to top in 2009
9226675 take your stinking paws off me you damned dirty ape
9226676 sought to transcend race and find a plane of unity
9226677 stronger than when he arrived but still with a hill to climb
9226678 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
9226679 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
9226680 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
9226681 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
9226682 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
9226683 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
9226684 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
9226685 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
9226686 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
9226687 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
9226688 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
9226689 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
9226690 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
9226691 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
9226692 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
9226693 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
9226694 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
9226695 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
9226696 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
9226697 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
9226698 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
9226699 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
9226700 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
9226701 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
9226702 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
9226703 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
9226704 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
9226705 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
9226706 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
9226707 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed
9226708 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9226709 we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
9226710 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are to restore that legacy
9226711 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9226712 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder forless
9226713 more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
9226714 the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
9226715 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000 though it may be even more obvious now because john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9226716 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9226717 too often the achievements of our opponents go unnoticed so i wanted to stop and say congratulations
9226718 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9226719 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that that election didnt matter
9226720 when he walks out on stage tonight in front of 75 000 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election
9226721 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
9226722 it was a very close election and certainly for a lot of people at that time who said theres no difference between al gore and
9226723 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield illinois and one term in congress during which he showed courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country in a war that was popular when it started but later condemned by history
9226724 the experience that lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9226725 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land
9226726 he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity
9226727 gore compared obama to abe lincoln what a laugh abe was honest patriatic humble a great statesman obama is none of these obama is so very arrogant he reminds me of hitler
9226728 gov crist now has an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the florida supreme court much like president bush has been able to do on the u s supreme court
9226729 hell be able to pick people who reflect his judgment and his conservative principles
9226730 theres no better way to accentuate your beliefs than with appointments to the court
9226731 this has not been a partisan court if i thought we were getting ideologues on the court id be concerned
9226732 to put conservative values and conservative ideas into the thick of the fight for justice and opportunity
9226733 they had their chance they have not led we will
9226734 on occasion he rambled through excessive repetition bush is most effective in personal contact not a set speech
9226735 how and what we do for all of you the people who pay the taxes bear the burdens and live the american dream
9226736 cant understand how a guy like george w bush can be leading a guy with the kind of caliber experience and know how as al gore
9226737 make sure that our prosperity enriches not just the few but all working families
9226738 i believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning
9226739 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
9226740 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
9226741 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9226742 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9226743 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9226744 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9226745 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger
9226746 after they wrecked our economy its time for a change
9226747 after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change
9226748 powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9226749 barack obamas vision and his voice represent the best of america
9226750 it is that common american identity which barack obama exemplifies heart and soul that enables us as americans to speak with moral authority to all of the people of the world
9226751 sen obama this is truly a good day for america how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
9226752 the reagan era is over and a new era is about to begin
9226753 in the meantime while on the look out ill be hoping for a more compassionate government from the next president
9226754 i dont know what i despise more ageism of all kinds
9226755 because you must be 18 to enlist 18 is a suitable minimum voting age
9226756 also i assume a president can exercise compassion without defying the constitution
9226757 gee why do we let them vote shouldnt we screen the registration system so only the intelligent and deserving dont worry john im sure youd make the cut are able to cast ballots
9226758 first of all your little plan of only letting smart educated people vote is going to backfire since polls show that more educated people overwhelmingly back obama
9226759 shame on you for assuming that younger people dont take the time to learn the issues and are just swayed by a charismatic man and shame on you for thinking you are better than us just because you are older and here i was always taught we were all created equal
9226760 only a moron would utter such words shame on you for being so dumb and ruining democracy for everyone else
9226761 only a moron would utter those words shame on you for being so dumb and ruining democracy for everyone else
9226762 those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it
9226763 you are helpless in this mess so we will fix it for you
9226764 cut taxes for 95 of the working people raise taxes on 5 raise taxes on business
9226765 how do you know when a politician is lying their lips are moving
9226766 that only goes to show how ridiculous our modern education system has become there is no wisdom in universities anymore any moron can get into college these days and the fact that obama is a harvard graduate does not say much for harvard
9226767 the american people think if the latest luntz poll is to be believed that the institutions of the republic are failing that the government mainly the executive branch which was suppose to serve them no longer does
9226768 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
9226769 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome
9226770 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
9226771 we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9226772 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
9226773 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9226774 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9226775 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
9226776 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9226777 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
9226778 he has to bring the smoke he has to bring the rain
9226779 attack thats the vps role make the case for the presidential candidate make the case against the other guy
9226780 the advantage of the role of the vice president is he doesnt have to worry about subtlety
9226781 we remember that he voted against the creation of medicare against the creation of medicaid against the clean air act against head start against the peace corps in the 60s and americorps in the 90s he even voted against the funds to send a man to the moon
9226782 if hes the most optimistic man in america id hate to see the pessimists
9226783 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
9226784 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
9226785 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
9226786 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9226787 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9226788 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt matter who became president
9226789 today we face the same choice we faced in 2000
9226790 barack obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises
9226791 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in war in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9226792 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9226793 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9226794 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9226795 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9226796 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9226797 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9226798 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9226799 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9226800 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9226801 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9226802 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9226803 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9226804 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9226805 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9226806 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9226807 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9226808 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
9226809 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
9226810 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
9226811 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
9226812 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
9226813 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
9226814 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
9226815 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
9226816 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
9226817 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
9226818 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
9226819 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
9226820 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
9226821 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
9226822 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
9226823 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
9226824 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
9226825 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
9226826 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
9226827 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
9226828 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
9226829 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
9226830 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
9226831 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9226832 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9226833 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9226834 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
9226835 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9226836 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9226837 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9226838 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9226839 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
9226840 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9226841 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9226842 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
9226843 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
9226844 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
9226845 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
9226846 hes the anchor of the show the muscle the guy that keeps things in line
9226847 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
9226848 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
9226849 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual

9226851 space based solar power as an opportunity for strategic security
9226852 the lunar infrastructure as proposed by the late gerard k oneill is well thought out
9226853 lastly i wanted to say that these figures are based on current residential demand
9226854 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
9226855 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
9226856 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
9226857 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
9226858 if they asked me id say spend your time in ohio or some of these other states where its going to be very close
9226859 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people
9226860 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
9226861 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
9226862 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
9226863 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
9226864 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
9226865 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
9226866 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
9226867 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
9226868 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
9226869 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
9226870 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
9226871 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
9226872 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
9226873 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
9226874 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
9226875 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
9226876 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
9226877 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
9226878 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
9226879 we are facing a planetary emergency which is not like anything we have experienced in the history of humankind
9226880 the solutions to all three require us to end our dependence on carbon based fossil fuels
9226881 we need to invest in innovation i hope we dont have to wait until oil and coal run out to tackle that
9226882 now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning mandatory caps on planet warming carbon
9226883 the carbon based industries have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for all its worth
9226884 taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
9226885 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving the climate crisis
9226886 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
9226887 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
9226888 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
9226889 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
9226890 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9226891 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9226892 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for those who are called to the cause of peace
9226893 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
9226894 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9226895 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
9226896 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
9226897 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
9226898 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9226899 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9226900 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
9226901 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9226902 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9226903 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9226904 look bro we are reaching if not already reached peak oil peak coal and peak natural gas
9226905 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
9226906 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
9226907 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
9226908 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
9226909 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
9226910 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
9226911 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks
9226912 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
9226913 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
9226914 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
9226915 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
9226916 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
9226917 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
9226918 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
9226919 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
9226920 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
9226921 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
9226922 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
9226923 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
9226924 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection

9226931 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
9226932 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
9226933 i knew abe abe was a friend of mine and baracks no lincoln
9226934 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
9226935 i thought it was a bit much for them suddenly to be persona non grata and out of my life
9226936 now he was throwing easily but he was in good spirits said riley in his day after remarks following a 36 28 loss at stanford in the season opener
9226937 everything we got from the doctor said he should work on range of motion and throw then just see how it goes
9226938 we wont hurry him and i dont anticipate him playing this week
9226939 its just what we knew said riley of the game which osu basically gave away with three turnovers and another error that led to a safety
9226940 but one thing after it was all said and done there was a lot of good learning to be done thats what we have to do with it
9226941 you cant do that very often and expect to win he said we already know that its always been our m o stopping the run those are the things penalties fumbles run defense that hit you right between the eyes but there was a ton of good football and a lot of good defense
9226942 it will be good to have al back said riley afalava had to sit game 1 because of his off season dui
9226943 played very well and he can even make some more throws he had some stuff hes like to have back the pick to bo mcnally but in terms of playing the game that was right in front of him he did a nice job
9226944 i dont think weve seen everything hes got said riley
9226945 theres plenty of football there for both of them said riley
9226946 hes a big fast back and he kept his pads down said the coach
9226947 we didnt wrap up and bounced off his pads basically thats what happened we got misaligned once and he cut out on us another time i think we had three guys hit him and then our corner tim clark over ran the play on the backside
9226948 we dont want to live like that with 54 passes in a game said riley
9226949 thats really not our style i dont think thats where were at our best
9226950 bodybag game because one school was just going for the paycheck osu gets between 1
9226951 we appreciate the school and the program that were playing as we did when we went to lsu said riley
9226952 the woodbury police are excited because they got something thats more serious than a cat up a tree
9226953 this is a very unique case and frankly i dont know the ramifications of anything yet
9226954 were just always looking out the windows the whole neighborhood in general is feeling the same way
9226955 that to me is ridiculous i dont understand how that can happen
9226956 hes going to have to bang a little bit to get in at me and hopefully ill be able to wake up by then
9226957 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl told him that he had come up with a plan on how to murder someone
9226958 mr eischens stated that mr busskohl wanted to find an adult male who lived by himself and within walking distance of the defendants house
9226959 mr busskohl stated that he would then either stab the potential victim in the chest or slash his throat mr busskohl told mr eischens that he would then either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
9226960 im not even sure i would have gone through with it
9226961 the evidence i received busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
9226962 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
9226963 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
9226964 i didnt even look at it as a murder plot until they actually started putting it on the news
9226965 what bothers me is if you throw a rock hes about four blocks away
9226966 which is a substantial step toward and more than preparation for the commission of the crime
9226967 but if we have somebody thats just simply preparing to commit the crime and does not take a substantial step toward committing that crime we cant charge an attempt and thats what this is all about
9226968 if it wasnt for his friend and the grace of god thatd be it
9226969 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride

9226973 its not going to change its not a family show
9226974 were still going to be on after 9 p m torchwood s a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are

9226981 the last time i was here i was performing at the grand which is always fantastic and i actually performed as the invisible man

9226984 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9226985 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9226986 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9226987 it takes just a moment when someone sits down in a hotel room they can bring up the cheque on a screen
9226988 they can go to a website called logos com which has the 5000 corporate logos of the largest companies of the world they bring down say for example a qantas logo put it on a cheque and then they put the name and address and then again the banks logo out of the yellow pages and put that on the cheque
9226989 im getting ready to wire you some funds but im needing wiring instructions
9226990 then theyll call back immediately and ask for corporate communications and ask if they would be kind enough to send them an annual report and in the annual report on page 3 is a signature of the chairman of the board the ceo the cfo the treasurer the controller and they scan the signature out of the annual report and put it on the cheque so they actually end up with the real account and the actual signature and because we pay so much cheques through automation it goes right through without any problem
9226991 its so simple to do unlike years ago when you needed colour printing presses colour separations negatives plates and some skill today someone with a pc a scanner and a printer can sit down and design a cheque in a matter of ten minutes
9226992 ci arrivai quando cera il fascismo che ora sta tornando in abiti nuovi

9226994 perhaps im not made like other women i dont know ive tried to be a good wife to you
9226995 he knows some men crave that sex but i want more
9226996 we all have to put up with something in life
9226997 emotions involved in taking a decision to murder someone have subsided
9226998 when im not around shes just curled up with a book by the fireplace
9226999 call in sick today were flying to puerto rico for the weekend
9227000 bill read got up in the middle of that interrupted it and said theyve just upped the category to a category 5 storm that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the golf coast to really pay attention
9227001 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9227002 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9227003 i dont think the hurricane will break them but i dont want someone breaking in
9227004 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9227005 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9227006 if its like katrina they might not let us back
9227007 they might put a fence around the whole parish and say go away
9227008 i mean my house is not even finished and then what its going to float away again
9227009 i was hoping to get all the way right at least before another hurricane came and ate up my world
9227010 if i would have been in my house for a day it would have been ok then i could have dealt with it
9227011 i dont have a car i had to come with my neighbors
9227012 but i wasnt going to wait not after katrina these things can be killers we know it now youd have to be a fool not to get out while the gettings good
9227013 i was here three days in this house after katrina the water was over my head i floated out on an ice chest to get away
9227014 im not goin they arent gonna scare me or run me out im tired im too tired to go through it all again
9227015 we watched katrina from the cockpit of a 19 foot sailboat
9227016 thats what we do we rebuild thats the nature of mankind
9227017 katrina was hell there is a reason to have anxiety
9227018 weve paid our dues as far as im concerned i know its selfish but thats the way it is
9227019 palin won a seat on the wasilla city council in 1992 as a
9227020 id feel safer saying this if the margin was wider but i think wasilla finally sees the light people see the need for change
9227021 based on my experience over the last six years with the city i certainly felt that i would have been valuable to the next person whoever that may be
9227022 are you ready to risk your prosperity and your lives and the lives of your children for the sake of saakashvili
9227023 the current plans are much better than they were in 2005 the ensured availability of gas would be a big deal
9227024 with that being said its not easy to move four million people in a handful of lanes
9227025 you should always prepare for tornadoes when you have tropical systems forming
9227026 right now we still have availability but youre never sure just like hurricanes
9227027 sometimes the rush come to us last minute and were booked up
9227028 should schools in new hampshire not open on tuesday because of the hurricane it would be an overreaction
9227029 having the primary on top of the holiday season just barely a few days after the iowa caucus i think does a great disservice to the voters
9227030 the idea that we had holiday greeting television ads was just unbelievable
9227031 the governor did nothing wrong and has nothing to hide
9227032 its outrageous that the obama campaign is trying to attack her over a family issue as a reformer and a leader on ethics reform she has been happy to help out in the investigation of this matter because she was never directly involved
9227033 this has been a tumultuous week in the department of public safety and as your governor i apologize
9227034 to investigate the circumstances and events surrounding the termination of former public safety commissioner monegan and potential abuses of power and or improper actions by members of the executive branch
9227035 i think it raises the profile but it doesnt really change the mission or the work
9227036 had threatened to kill my dad and bring me down
9227037 for the record no one ever said fire wooten not the governor not todd not any of the other staff
9227038 what they said directly was more along the lines of this isnt a person that we would want to be representing our state troopers
9227039 this is a governor who really built her name by stepping on the back of sinners randy ruedrich greg renkes frank murkowski
9227040 and now her administration seems to be taking the same approach as the people that she criticized
9227041 the governor did nothing wrong and has nothing to hide
9227042 its outrageous that the obama campaign is trying to attack her over a family issue as a reformer and a leader on ethics reform she has been happy to help out in the investigation of this matter because she was never directly involved

9227051 we never did have a fight i think i would remember jennies fist connecting with a part of my body or a part of my face
9227052 thank you for your interest in sallie mae the nations leading provider of saving and paying for college programs severe legislative cuts made by congress made federal student loan consolidation uneconomical this combined with the credit market deterioration has caused us to suspend participation in the federal consolidation loan program
9227053 sallie mae reserves the right to modify or discontinue loan programs at any time without notice
9227054 for tonight we want to come back strong and with the fire that we had last night
9227055 it wasnt quite there for this afternoon match and we want to come out stronger tonight and work on what we have been taught over the past couple of months
9227056 dan heb je het over een omvangrijk tekort op een totaal van 3000 psychiaters mis je er 300 en dan moet je als sector alle zeilen bijzetten om te zorgen dat er geen ongelukken gebeuren
9227057 voor ouders met kinderen met autisme of adhd bijvoorbeeld is het grootste probleem om berhaupt een diagnose te krijgen van een psychiater
9227058 dat vind ik een enorm hoog aantal het betekent dat er een groot tekort is aan artsen in de ggz die basisartsen worden vaak gebruikt om de gaten in vacatures voor psychiaters op te vullen dat is een heel ongewenste situatie dat is echt een misstand
9227059 pati nten zien soms pas na twee jaar een psychiater maar er is maar n manier om een pati nt te beoordelen namelijk de pati nt zelf zien en niet verslagen van anderen lezen psychiaters zijn een pati ntenfobie aan het ontwikkelen
9227060 foi um lance confuso sofri a falta e na hora de tentar levantar acabei pisando nele

9227070 so here again the employer is in the fault for handing over a duty that was not listed in the initial work agreement in addition the prosecution has even failed to come up with a possible motive for the alleged killing
9227071 this is a matter between life and death and the court is obliged to look into the matter in a serious manner
9227072 the police usually do not get back with the findings of their investigations but carry out their prosecutions through the courts
9227073 en la medida en que inviertan en baruta petare en una zapater a en catia en una f brica de textiles en la yaguara si crean diez ocho quince o veinte plazas de trabajo para la juventud desocupada para los hombres y mujeres aptos para ejercer un oficio por cada empleo que le ofrezcan a los ciudadanos caraque os tendr n una compensaci n en materia impositiva

9227075 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9227076 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9227077 i dont think the hurricane will break them but i dont want someone breaking in
9227078 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented

9227108 you get the feeling that the sooner the whole thing is finished the better
9227109 the chapter finally closes with the end of the transfer market i think there is going to be lots of reasonably furious action between now and then
9227110 without a doubt it has had an awful lot to do with the start to the season
9227111 with the comings and goings players are obviously trying their best to concentrate 100 percent but i think it has affected things slightly with their work on the training ground and even going into games it has been affected by this
9227112 it would have been great to have been a lot calmer but you have to grin and bear it and get on with things
9227113 certainly the ideal situation is that you get your squad settled early you work with all the players in the pre season period
9227114 chelsea are currently in a situation where they are built to be champions or contenders in every trophy they care to enter
9227115 they have the ability to sign absolutely top echelon stars from anywhere around the world pick the cream of the crop to try and win every trophy we are kind of in a different league to that
9227116 this championship brings together lesbian and gay football teams from across the world encourages more gay people to get involved in the sport and through the spending power of visiting teams and spectators benefits the london economy

9227141 this restaurant is a very cute and stylish place for a delish brunch

9227145 they define these as peer production ideagoras prosumer communities the new alexandrians open platforms global plant floors and wiki workplaces
9227146 more and more people expect and demand to have access to the internet and new wireless technologies
9227147 it is important that the fcc try to find new ways to address
9227148 affect how we and others see the world as it is and as it might be
9227149 the basic intuition and popular belief that the internet will bring greater freedom and global equity has been around since the early 1990s the technophilic response is reminiscent of claims made in the past for electricity for radio or for telegraph
9227150 there is no guarantee that networked information technology will lead to the improvements in innovation freedom and justice that i suggest are possible that is a choice we face as a society
9227151 offers the promise of a deep change in how we see the world around us how we come to know about it and evaluate it
9227152 while the networked information economy cannot solve global hunger and disease its emergence does open reasonably well defined new avenues for addressing and constructing some of the basic requirements of justice and human development
9227153 offers no reassurances however that any of this will in fact come to pass
9227154 we have an opportunity to change the way we create and exchange information knowledge and culture by doing so we can make the twenty first century one that offers individuals greater autonomy political communities greater democracy and societies greater opportunities for cultural self reflection and human connection
9227155 that alone is more than enough to justify an embrace of the networked information economy by anyone who values human welfare development and freedom
9227156 this gives individuals a significantly greater role in authoring their own lives by enabling them to perceive a broader range of possibilities and by providing them a richer baseline against which to measure the choices they in fact make
9227157 some good some bad most too complex to label that are effecting the ways groups assemble and cooperate these changes are profound because they are amplifying or extending our essential social skills and our characteristic social failings as well
9227158 seen in the light social tools dont create collective action they merely remove the obstacles to it
9227159 this pattern is general to social media on mailing lists with more than a couple dozen participants the most active writer is generally much more active than the person in the number two slot and far more active than the average bloggers wikipedia contributors photographers people conversing on mailing lists and social participation in many other large scale systems all exhibit a similar pattern
9227160 fewer than two percent of wikipeida users ever contribute yet that is enough to create profound value for millions of users
9227161 the core wikipedia community could not create wikipedia along because they could not generate enough raw material or take advantage of enough novel points of view similarly the huge but relatively diffuse group of contributors who are not self consciously part of the community could edit articles but unless the most committed members of the community defended them those edits would be destroyed by vandals
9227162 when people care enough they can come together and accomplish things of a scope and longevity that were previously impossible they can do big things for love
9227163 as a kind of street performance as well as an ironic commentary on the conformism of hipster culture
9227164 political action has changed when a group of previously uncoordinated actors can create a public protest that the government can neither interdict in advance nor suppress without triggering public documentation
9227165 increased flexibility and power for group action will have more good effects than bad ones making the current changes on balance positive
9227166 it is never going to be done the process is going to continue for the rest of the human experience until communication is instantaneous its not fast enough until the network is infinite its not big enough

9227170 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9227171 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9227172 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9227173 whether listeria was the actual cause or the underlying cause is very difficult to determine
9227174 many of our recalls relate to products such as sandwiches and pre packaged meats meats carrying best before dates that have now already expired
9227175 nevertheless in the public interest and in the interest of openness we feel it is important that such info is visible

9227181 we can clinch it sunday said dixon who has won four times this year when starting from the pole
9227182 it would mean a lot there is a lot of pressure going on at the moment you want to get it done
9227183 as everyone always says your first win you never forget castroneves said
9227184 every time i come over here i never forget about that it was a very special moment but that was the past and now we need to focus on the business of what we need to do this weekend
9227185 i like to go after it i like to push it as the hunted you have pressure and if you make a mistake its going to play into the hands of the hunter
9227186 in my eyes we have a great situation here momentum is the key ganassi has been having a fantastic year but finally theyre starting to show some signs of weakness we hope they continue showing that
9227187 the car that we used for sonoma was actually the car that we were supposed to use for detroit castroneves said

9227236 i think vanity un fair sought out anyone who had a
9227237 peace co operation and mutual assistance with abkhazia and south ossetia
9227238 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
9227239 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
9227240 a step towards further escalation of tensions with russia and the desire to drive the situation into an even worse deadlock
9227241 we hope that common sense will prevail over emotions and that eu leaders will find the strength to reject a one sided assessment of the conflict neither party needs the confrontation towards which some countries are being energetically pushed by the eu
9227242 further sliding to confrontation with russia and attempts to put pressure on us are unacceptable as they can entail irreversible consequences in the military political climate and in stability on the continent
9227243 the reality is were likely going to have a national disaster going on
9227244 we dont know exactly what this thing is going to do or when

9227269 a windfall profits tax on oil companies in alaska the states resource valuation system aces provides strong incentives for companies to re invest their profits in new production
9227270 windfall profits taxes alone prevent additional investment in domestic production without new supplies from american reserves our dependency and addiction to foreign sources of oil will continue
9227271 its looking more likely than it was before these meetings
9227272 he said that he doubted that there was any common ground

9227274 comply with international human rights principles in controlling the demonstrators
9227275 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
9227276 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
9227277 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
9227278 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can

9227281 i think we already lost the war and im afraid there is no military solution of this situation
9227282 when i said we georgians are not winners in this conflict it does not mean russia has won
9227283 russia showed once again its real face that it preferred to be the gendarme in international relations and not to be a distinguished member of the international community that will be respected
9227284 in due course i expect there will be some new waves of mass protests here in the country
9227285 to what extent this government will be able to survive those protests remains to be seen but it is obvious there will be some internal political instability
9227286 i do not see any major breach from our side the principles we stayed for years we do not want to confront russia with its huge resources but its russia that wants to reconquer georgia so we should not defend ourselves
9227287 its not something they feel comfortable with so the path of development of this situation and whether they will apply this invasion pattern to other countries in the neighborhood would depend on how strongly the international community would pursue the line it has taken
9227288 this is a very decisive moment either russia succeeds and the west fails or west succeeds and russia fails

9227291 this is a very solemn moment for all the tibetans
9227292 this is a time to reflect on how we did this year for freedom and a moment to pause and think for ourselves in these trying times of our history
9227293 theres a feeling that the west treats russia merely as a loser in the cold war which has to play by the winners rules
9227294 putin was expecting some reciprocity for joining the antiterrorist coalition what he got instead was further nato expansion to russias back yard and aggressive pipeline policy to weaken russias position in the energy market
9227295 the sooner europe equips itself to confront the challenges of a resurgent russia the better
9227296 theres the danger that things could be left in such a poisonous state that the next administration has no options and finds it difficult to get on a productive track

9227303 we can confirm that two bodies were recovered last night from the main part of osbaston house maesbrook
9227304 the remains will be examined by a home office pathologist and post mortems are due to be carried out later today to establish the cause of death
9227305 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed
9227306 in the meantime we will keep an open mind concerning what we may or may not find
9227307 whats troubling is that even if it was the israelis it happened in damascus in a safe area meters from the office of intelligence chief assef shawkat
9227308 the americans are making up stories about me and hold me responsible for a lot of attacks against them that happened around the world
9227309 sometimes they think of me as if i have the key to the universe it is difficult for them to understand that i am part of an institution that patiently plans and designs its moves
9227310 locals in the county rushed out into the open cracks appeared on house walls and many windows were broken
9227311 this is an abject failure of the indian state to protect the right to life of the citizens since all entry roads have been blocked with logs and the law enforcement personnel have access to remote areas of the district the hindu fundamentalists are being allowed to carry out mass killings of the christians
9227312 im very confident that there will be an absolute clearance for mr peters in a relatively short period of time
9227313 i think fair or unfair and i do think it is a more concentrated criticism that hillary gets on so many fronts thats unfortunate but fair or unfair i think she does herself a disservice to even mention it you got to plow through that you have to know what your getting into which i say this with all due respect to hillary clinton and to her experience and to her passion for changing the status quo but when i hear a statement like that coming from any woman candidate with any kind of a perceived whine about that excess criticism or a sharper microscope put on her that doesnt do us any good women in politics women in general wanting to progress this country i dont think it bodes well for her because a statement like that again fair or unfair it is a reality and i think its a given i think people just accept that she is going to be under that sharper microscope so be it you have to work harder prove yourself to an even greater degree that youre capable that youre going to be the best candidate and that of course is what she wants us to believe at this point it bothers me a little bit to hear of her bringing that attention to herself
9227314 i recognize that hillary seems to be trying real hard to be tough but i say more power to her i think she had to do that unfortunate that shes had to do that but she comes across to me as tough capable i can respect that in her that she is this tough capable and experienced you wonder though if there is another side to her that is i dont know softer softer isnt the right word you wonder about the personality you know whats the other side like what i have perceived from watching main stream media is shes trying really hard to be tough and to show that resume and to prove shes got the experience thats been the latest round of everything last week experience as youve said its gone round and round as to what the message has been in the campaign but it does come back to the experience i recognize thats what shes trying to do and that its unfortunate again that maybe a woman candidate feels that they have to go there question did you ever feel like you had to go there no you know and back to hillary again
9227315 we are committed to resisting and overturning the system of violence inflicted daily on the people of this country and the world and against the natural environment by political and corporate power in the pursuit of profit we are resolved that our group will not instigate violence against human beings as a means to end this system of violence and injustice
9227316 grieved for those who imagining that they are making the revolution are destroying it the violence of the old regime will only be destroyed by non participation in violence and not at all by the new and foolish acts of violence which are now being committed

9227400 the most important thing is not looks but skill at talking
9227401 and the moneys very good i meet different targets every day im not so keen on the old ones and i sometimes get to like the young ones i sleep with all of them
9227402 the thrill of doing something forbidden the feel of their hearts going doki doki for mrs b its a thrill to be with a guy who isnt her husband she must know shes taking a risk but you see her husband has a girlfriend she doesnt know about so its best for them to separate even though when i disappear shell be sad if i thought about that too much i wouldnt be able to do my job
9227403 before i started acyours there were businesses that investigated affairs but none that helped solve problems people get depressed about personal relationships and i wanted to help
9227404 but look at it this way it could be shes been causing him trouble for years
9227405 its much easier to seduce a man than a woman
9227406 women dont have affairs for fun for them its serious
9227407 around 27 women start to enjoy sex i specialise in women in their late twenties who enjoy sex
9227408 by the time theyre 45 theyre not so interested in thrills they just want to be together with someone
9227409 girls like men who are a little offbeat most men are prepared to be considerate to an extent but girls like someone who can read their feelings
9227410 we investigate her lover and send a female agent to seduce him the lover falls for the female agent and leaves the target
9227411 very often its not that the target wants a divorce but that shes blinded by love and wants to get together with this new lover if that ends shell return to her husband in other words the desire to be with the lover is much stronger than the desire to separate from the husband
9227412 but its not enough to separate the wife from her lover
9227413 next we improve the husband if he has stopped taking the wife out we advise him to surprise her with presents on their anniversary or her birthday or take her to a nice restaurant if its the wife who wants to get back with her husband we try to make her more attractive
9227414 i searched on the internet and found gnc and went to see mr tomiya he told me not to worry i was so happy to hear that id been crying and crying mr tomiya sent an agent to hiro to have a suit made the agent went again and again for fittings and the two became friends one night mr tomiya the agent and hiro went drinking i was in a different bar with a female agent the male agent called the female agent as if they were lovers and said come and join us so i went along too hiro was pleased to see me but a bit shy he was still seeing the other girl
9227415 i used to be tough but im softer now more feminine mr tomiya boosted my confidence

9227421 i would have loved if we could have met in the final
9227422 my biggest worry is that she is so good im worried how im going to get past her more than anything
9227423 she played well that time but im looking forward to continuing to serve well move well and play well out here
9227424 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9227425 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment in her scant two years as governor
9227426 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil
9227427 i know no matter which way we went with this decision somebody was going to be upset
9227428 i recognized that going in and i expected them to be upset he leinart is disappointed because he felt like he had made progress and he has made progress

9227441 both mccann and palin gave troopers detailed accounts of what happened wooten was headed home in a rage mccann said
9227442 he would eat a fing lead bullet i will shoot him
9227443 palin drove over and watched through the window she and mccann both said wooten was all wound up a neighbor who stood watch as well later told troopers that wooten looked angry but that mccann wasnt cowering or anything
9227444 put a leash on your sister and family or im going to bring them down
9227445 the same day a concerned neighbor of the couple called troopers with more accusations including alcohol abuse based on what heath and mccann had relayed to him
9227446 the troopers investigation into wooten began after chuck heath wootens father in law and palin and mccanns dad alerted troopers about a domestic violence protective order mccann had obtained against wooten on april 11 2005 mccann filed for divorce the same day according to the court docket
9227447 on april 27 2005 trooper sgt ron wall began the internal investigation interviewing and re interviewing more than 15 people over a period of months witnesses included palin her husband todd two of their children heath mccann her son wooten friends neighbors a bartender and other troopers
9227448 in an internal state police investigation in 2005 palin herself had accused wooten of threatening to harm her father during the breakup of her sisters marriage
9227449 in august 2005 nearly four months after the investigation began palin wrote a lengthy e mail to grimes about wooten that included some new accusations and new witnesses
9227450 in october 2005 palin announced she was running for governor sgt wall who is now a lieutenant over patrol in fairbanks finished his investigation the same month
9227451 chuck heath writes grimes saying that the investigation is dragging on too long and wooten is
9227452 grimes issues a letter suspending wooten for 10 days and warning that the discipline is

9227457 palin had at first denied that her office had a hand in pushing to have the trooper fired but was those denials when taped evidence emerged that a staffer in her office was involved

9227470 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
9227471 as fellow catholics and legislators we wish you pelosi would have made a more honest effort to lay out the authentic position of the church on this core moral issue before attempting to address it with authority
9227472 your subsequent remarks mangle catholic church doctrine regarding the inherent sanctity and dignity of human life therefore we are compelled to refute your error
9227473 to reduce the scandal and consternation caused amongst the faithful by your remarks we necessarily write you to correct the public record and affirm the churchs actual and historical teaching that defends the sanctity of human life
9227474 you shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish
9227475 the inalienable rights of the person must be recognized and respected by civil society and the political authority these human rights belong to human nature and are inherent in the person from the moment of conception until death
9227476 formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense the church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life
9227477 those who are excommunicated and others who obstinately persist in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to holy communion
9227478 the first right of the human person is his life it does not belong to society nor does it belong to public authority in any form to recognize this right for some and not others from the time the ovum is fertilized a life is begun which is neither that of the father nor of the mother it is rather the life of a new human being
9227479 for centuries had not been able to agree on when life begins
9227480 on behalf of the 650 000 catholics of this archdiocese i wish to reinforce what cardinal rigali bishop lori of bridgeport conn
9227481 surely there may be some catholic politicians who will take a different interpretation of this church doctrine during the coming election campaign but speaker pelosis remarks underscore once again the need for catholics and especially catholic politicians to form their consciences according to the moral truths taught by the catholic church
9227482 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
9227483 i very much respect house speaker nancy pelosis right to speak to public policy however interpreting the teachings of the church is not in her domain but is entrusted to our holy father pope benedict xvi and to the bishops who are in communion with him the catholic church from the beginning of time has condemned abortion as immoral and contrary to the laws of god

9227559 access to aq khan to expose many sacred cows richard armitages secret deal
9227560 over four years several of these officials said operatives of the cia paid the tinners as much as 10 million some of it delivered in a suitcase stuffed with cash in return the tinners delivered a flow of secret information that helped end libyas bomb programme reveal irans atomic labours and ultimately undo dr khans nuclear black market
9227561 the tinners played an important role in a clandestine american operation to funnel sabotaged nuclear equipment to libya and iran a major but little known element of the efforts to slow their nuclear progress
9227562 the relationship with the tinners was very significant said gary s samore who ran the national security councils nonproliferation office when the operation began thats where we got the first indications that iran had acquired centrifuges which enrich uranium for nuclear fuel
9227563 the sabotage first came to light diplomats and officials said when inspectors from the international atomic energy agency traveled to iran and libya in 2003 and 2004 and discovered identical vacuum pumps that had been damaged cleverly so that they looked perfectly fine but failed to operate properly
9227564 a more serious disruption involved a power supply shipped to iran from turkey where dr khans network did business with two makers of industrial control equipment
9227565 the iranians installed the power supply at their uranium enrichment plant at natanz but in early 2006 it failed causing 50 centrifuges to explode a serious if temporary setback to irans efforts to master the manufacture of nuclear fuel the hardest part of building a bomb

9227679 i hope i am misreading what youve written but it appears you refer to god speaking outside or apart from the truth already revealed in scripture i believe the holy spirit comes to reveal or quicken gods truth as revealed in his word to walk down a path that says gods revelation to me can supersede scripture is at the very least dangerous
9227680 is the bible the only way that the lord speaks to us today
9227681 can the lord speak something to us that is not referred to in the bible
9227682 i will not leave you as orphans i will give you the holy spirit who will lead you into all truth when he comes he will make me known and then you will go out to all the ends of the earth and testify about me
9227683 waite for the bible to be written in full form only then will you know what to do
9227684 surely the sovereign lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets

9227694 a century and a half ago when america faced our greatest trial the end of one era gave birth to another
9227695 the candidate who emerged victorious in that election is now regarded by most historians as our greatest president
9227696 before he entered the white house abraham lincolns experience in elective office consisted of eight years in his state legislature in springfield ill and one term in congress during which he showed the courage and wisdom to oppose the invasion of another country that was popular when it started but later condemned by history
9227697 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9227698 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9227699 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9227700 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9227701 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what

9227704 i strongly believe that adding them polar bears that is not scientists to the list is the wrong move at this time my decision is based on a comprehensive review by state wildlife officials of scientific information from a broad range of climate ice and polar bear experts
9227705 overall we believe that the methods and analytical approaches used to examine the currently available information supports the primary conclusions and inferences stated in these 9 reports
9227706 polar bears are more numerous now than they were 40 years ago

9227708 we saw how law enforcement officials in london were able to track the suspects using their surveillance system during the july 2005 terrorist attack
9227709 it will be critical because now our police officers who have data mobile units in their cars will be able to tap into the camera network and have a sense of what is going on before they get to a crime scene
9227710 the fastest way to identify violent crime and move against it
9227711 we need a president thats as good as our people
9227712 this is about getting people to vote getting people to the polls
9227713 michigan is going to be a tough state for us
9227714 weve need to get businesses out of the situation where their health care costs go up three times the rate of inflation
9227715 ive seen barack obamas plan it begins the process of moving americans toward a system at a pace americans choose

9227720 had westerners become certain that the resolutions would bring us down to our knees they would have definitely intensified the sanctions
9227721 our navy presence in the mediterranean will increase russian vessels will be visiting syria and other friendly ports more frequently
9227722 we work exceptionally hard to minimize any collateral damage zero collateral damage is the goal
9227723 im encouraged that hes taken action and i also think its going to take some time
9227724 prescheduled meeting aimed at discussing security matters at strategic level the discussion was held in an open and cordial manner
9227725 shell be tough on john mccain but he is her friend and you have to be careful about how you go after an american vietnam war icon really
9227726 we believe that the listing was unwarranted and that it is unprecedented to list a currently healthy population based on uncertain climate models
9227727 even the bush administration cannot deny the reality of global warming
9227728 the governor is aligning herself and the state of alaska with the most discredited fringe extreme viewpoints by denying this
9227729 she is either grossly misinformed or intentionally misleading and both are unbecoming
9227730 first sea ice is vital to polar bear survival second the polar bears habitat has dramatically melted third sea ice is likely to further recede in the future
9227731 we will continue to watch the storm closely and ramp up our efforts as conditions dictate
9227732 we will be ready regardless of what mother nature sends our way
9227733 our approach in texas is to prepare for the worst and pray for the best
9227734 our goal is to control gustav and not let gustav control us
9227735 this is a very dangerous storm make no doubt about it we fully expect a category 3 or 4 hurricane
9227736 let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if i am president
9227737 we are tired of borrowing money from china to pay for persian oil
9227738 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
9227739 serious and lasting damage to the us uk intelligence sharing relationship and thus the national security of the uk and the aggressive and unprecedented intervention in the apparently functioning adjudicatory processes of a longtime ally of the uk in contravention of well established principles of international comity
9227740 no movement on the central question where was mr mohamed between 2002 and 2004
9227741 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
9227742 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented
9227743 i would hope that the democrats could have enough senators elected in november so that we would not any longer need to include joe lieberman among the senators
9227744 a single missile salvo from the moskva missile cruiser and two or three missile boats would be enough to annihilate the entire group
9227745 like police in other countries we never use any kind of tools to beat unarmed people
9227746 they beat me on my face and used a stun gun to shock my daughter
9227747 i was there and i saw them using stun guns to give electrical shocks to our church members
9227748 i could see the guns flare they also beat people their denial once again shows that they never respect the truth
9227749 gods redemptive work is opposed to structures of injustice at every level in our world that maintains the privileges of the powerful we must loudly condemn the injustices our people have to suffer
9227750 the dispute in thai ha is not the problem between 15 acres of land and a half of an acre it is the justice and injustice and the way this government treats religious groups
9227751 the protest must continue until the justice prevails and people of faith can practice their faiths free of harassment and oppression
9227752 like police in other countries we never use any kind of tools to beat unarmed people
9227753 i was there and i saw them using stun guns to give electrical shocks to our church members
9227754 i could see the guns flare they also beat people their denial once again shows that they never respect the truth
9227755 they beat me on my face and used a stun gun to shock my daughter
9227756 if they need more land for their religious practice they have to apply to authorities to be granted land in accordance with the law
9227757 we will continue to pray peacefully demanding that the government give us justice
9227758 yesterday evening around 100 parishioners including five to six priests from thai ha parish gathered before the headquarters of dong da district police creating pressure demanding the release of the accused
9227759 certainly before that there was some over reactions like abusing the policemen in charge and as such we had to temporarily detain three persons
9227760 we were in the street on thai ha street and the police repressed the christians using electric shocks
9227761 a lot of people were beaten by police they were beaten very hard
9227762 we never use supporting instruments to beat those who do not violate the law these instruments are only used when police are attacked
9227763 from august 14 the priests and parishioners have ignored the law
9227764 they are determined to occupy the land by all means
9227765 we bought the land in 1943 with the intention of building a new church but due to the war we couldnt build the church
9227766 senator biden is in terrific health leads a vigorous lifestyle and looks forward to an extremely busy campaign schedule as we sprint into the fall campaign
9227767 as i heard it my chances of surviving the surgery were certainly better than fifty fifty
9227768 but the chances of waking up with serious deficits to my mental faculties were more significant
9227769 in the moment that mattered most to me i had been the kind of man i wanted to be
9227770 atheism disbelief in or denial of the existence of god
9227771 competition is always good for consumers and therefore the industry customers will ultimately decide where the best deals are and were confident that we have great value
9227772 faculty staff and students might come together to have a beer instead of students having the proverbial kegger
9227773 the ultimate goal beyond what the drinking age is is what effective way can we come up with to model responsible drinking
9227774 theres never going to be one lever you pull and youll be able to move the needle
9227775 by reducing the legal drinking age back to 18 you would basically be saying you dont care about the thousands of kids who were killed because of alcohol
9227776 no state dares consider anything other than the current law because they cant afford to lose that funding
9227777 they can think out of the box but they cant act on those thoughts
9227778 students should learn from their own experience whether they make the right decision or the wrong one
9227779 by the time youre 18 you are somewhat of an adult
9227780 theres a certain amount of people who are afraid of getting caught and being prosecuted
9227781 if the drinking age is lowered to 18 no one is going to have that fear and its going to be complete chaos
9227782 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
9227783 congress is continuing with the british era policy to keep itself in power it constituted the sachhar committee a head count was ordered in the armed forces which is considered as a secular institution
9227784 the muslims are being cheated in the name of reservation i would like to tell them that muslims with a sound economic background would only be able to enjoy the benefits of reservation and the poor man would still not be able to enjoy its benefits

9227786 they have no other way to keep us from leaving here with palestinians who have already received visas and who have been accepted into european schools it is their right
9227787 theyre suffering from the arrogance of being in power too long at the moment theyre a coalition corpse theyre gone and anybody who is associated too closely with them is likely to be gone as well
9227788 clearly were not going to be the party that wins the most votes but we are hoping to be the players after the election and we are doing all that we can to take the seven maori seats and put ourselves in a position where we will not be the last cab off the rank but be the first limousine
9227789 when we come to power we will allow no freedom for anyone but ourselves
9227790 the formation by the workers of the soviets their own organs of power and action in itself signifies the disintegration and dissolution of the state as a much more recent form of organisation and one created by the proletariat itself the trade union will survive much longer because it has its roots in a much more living tradition of personal experience and once it has shaken off state democratic illusions will therefore claim a place in the conceptual world of the proletariat but since the trade unions have emerged from the proletariat itself as products of its own creative activity it is in this field that we shall see the most new formations as continual attempts to adapt to new conditions following the process of revolution new forms of struggle and organisation will be built on the model of the soviets in a process of constant transformation and development
9227791 i think he will be snatching the distance and clinching
9227792 i would rather fight valuev because unfortunately i had to cancel the two scheduled dates for our fight because of my illness in may and then the accident with my left foot at the end of june

9227877 we have two groups that are coming who stayed here in 2005 when hurricane rita hit
9227878 when they heard there was a chance the hurricane could hit the texas coast they called to make reservations
9227879 for the past few days the texas emergency management team has been implementing our tested and proven operational plan placing key personnel on standby and moving resources toward the anticipated area of impact
9227880 we will continue to watch the storm closely and ramp up our efforts as conditions dictate so that we will be ready regardless of what mother nature sends our way
9227881 were still being told the hurricane could hit anywhere along the texas louisiana or mississippi coast and we wont know until the storm gets closer to making landfall
9227882 were not expecting anything to happen but we need to be ready
9227883 i think its a matter of trying to help out where possible and when its needed
9227884 i was frustrated but i tried to keep that under control
9227885 stewards are very important persons who shouldnt be disturbed while working on much more important tasks
9227886 the governor did nothing wrong and has nothing to hide
9227887 its outrageous that the obama campaign is trying to attack her over a family issue as a reformer and a leader on ethics reform she has been happy to help out in the investigation of this matter because she was never directly involved
9227888 to investigate the circumstances and events surrounding the termination of former public safety commissioner monegan and potential abuses of power and or improper actions by members of the executive branch
9227889 for the record no one ever said fire wooten not the governor not todd not any of the other staff
9227890 what they said directly was more along the lines of this isnt a person that we would want to be representing our state troopers

9227925 we hardly needed evidence although there is more than enough that gitmo was going to be a torture chamber
9227926 professor chomsky is right to borrow from president clinton the world is much more impressed by the power of americas example than the example of american power likewise the world is more impressed by british principle than the pretense of britains special relationship a true friend to american would not stand by while president bush squanders americas birthright
9227927 the uk governments reaction to the us programme of rendition a policy of kidnapping people and taking them to places where they may be tortured has been inadequate to say the least it is scarcely credible that now despite all we know about rendition and the uks involvement in it the british government still refuses to condemn this illegal immoral and counterproductive policy
9227928 as an atlanticist i believe that a strong transatlantic alliance is an essential part of combating dangerous extremism but this does not mean turning a blind eye or as the high court recently found in the case of binyam mohamed facilitating americas deeply damaging rendition programme we cannot afford to undermine the values we are seeking to export the uk must use its influence to convince the united states that rendition does precisely this
9227929 i think perhaps chomsky has been looking in the wrong place the mail on sunday and i have certainly been trenchant in our criticism of some this the war in iraq and guantanamo for example we were one of the first to run pictures of the orange jumpsuits alongside stories about guantanamo
9227930 in some respects there has been a failure of the modern left where traditional leftwing writers have been supporting the war on terror as some sort of liberal crusade that is partly because of the labour government which made the left believe they have had friends in office chomsky needs to look in other places if he wants to find voices of criticism

9228079 we dont take that lightly we just dont think he has a message we dont think hes good for women
9228080 i think the democratic party took women for granted in the primary they didnt step on sexism when they should have and i cant support them
9228081 the fact that he went out on a limb to pick a woman im very impressed by that

9228093 theres going to be a need to really reach out to them to highlight the difference between john mccain and barack obama on the issues women care about
9228094 for the first time in more than 15 years i can no longer consider myself a democrat

9228251 he had one interception but it wasnt his fault because they ran two slant routes and it was a bad offensive call
9228252 glennon needs to step down and let tyrod in take his redshirt off and go ahead and let him play
9228253 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy

9228265 turkmenistan considers russia its good friend and strategic partner and intends to develop a constructive dialogue
9228266 we dont want to end up like we did with katrina putting people in those travel trailers

9228284 weve got terribly big challenges now whether it be housing or employment its very very tough times its very tough but were still the most innovative the most productive the greatest exporter the greatest importer

9228320 tantissimo beh questo conferma che ho sempre avuto ragione nessuno mi batte in campo donne
9228321 tom ti prego finiscila gi sono afflitto perch non mi si fila di striscio
9228322 ma no dai solo questione di tempo lo sai che io ci sono ok
9228323 ciao vale che ci fai qui pensavo fossi uscita con damiano

9228333 the governor was already scheduled to speak to the convention
9228334 insinuated that delgadillo was trying to block the audit because he feared auditors might find that the workers compensation division including the hiring or outside attorneys is inefficient and wasting taxpayer dollars
9228335 what is he afraid of what doesnt he want the public to see
9228336 there appears to be significant confusion as to the intent of both commissions and the meaning of the language that was ultimately submitted to the voters in this regard legal action between two city elected officials is an extreme avenue to resolve disputes and spending taxpayer money including the hiring of outside counsel for the controller that would be required if this litigation proceeds should be a last resort all other avenues for resolving this issue should be explored it is imperative that the council receive a complete briefing from both the city attorney and controller and explore options for resolving this issue in a manner that best serves the public

9228343 heres a finding from gallup among democratic women including those who may be disappointed that hillary clinton did not win the democratic nomination 9 say palin makes them more likely to support mccain 15 less likely
9228344 from rasmussen some 38 of men said they were more likely to vote for mccain now but only 32 of women
9228345 except for the one that he accepted as his vp

9228485 daarom volgen wij de toestand op de voet en zeg ik enkele gebeden
9228486 know who you are in god and understand that your life is given for his mission
9228487 the kingdom of god does not come with observation 21 nor will they say see here or see there d for indeed the kingdom of god is within you
9228488 the kingdom of the world teaches us that one is prosperous based on his possessions and prestige
9228489 take heed and beware of covetousness b for ones life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses
9228490 so patience is the ability to remain the same amp be constant while waiting for someone of something to change to be patient is to not become irritated or angry with others or with situations in our lives or the lives of other
9228491 that the time table of the developing of patience in you is determined by how you go thru difficulties or difficult people
9228492 be good to people choose doing good for them over being evil to them even if you feel that that they dont deserve it i
9228493 therefore i say to you do not worry about your life what you will eat nor about the body what you will put on
9228494 and do not seek what you should eat or what you should drink nor have an anxious mind 30 for all these things the nations of the world seek after and your father knows that you need these things 31 but seek the kingdom of god and all these things c shall be added to you
9228495 do not fear little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom

9228500 we might notice for instance that theories of atonement of the meaning of the cross are not simply a set of alternative answers to the same question they give the answers they give because of the question they ask if the question is how can i get to heaven despite the sin because of which i deserve to be punished the answer may well be because jesus has been punished in your place but if the question is how can gods plan to rescue and renew the entire world go ahead despite the corruption and decay that have come about because of human rebellion the answer may well be because on the cross jesus defeated the powers of evil which have enslaved rebel humans and so ensured continuing corruption please note these and other possible questions and answers are not mutually exclusive my point is that reframing the question will mean rethinking the various answers we might give and the relationship between them

9228570 fu in quel momento seduta a pranzo impegnata a conversare con sette estranei curiosi che li vidi per la prima volta erano seduti nellangolo pi lontano e isolato della mensa erano in cinque non parlavano e non mangiavano bench ognuno di loro avesse di fronte a s un vassoio pieno di cibo intatto non mi stavano squadrando a differenza della maggior parte degli altri studenti perci potevo osservalli tranquillamente senza temere di incontrare uno sguardo un po troppo curioso ma non furono questi i particolari ad attirare e catturare la mia attenzione non si somigliavano affatto dei tre ragazzi uno era grosso nerboruto come un sollevatore di pesi professionista i capelli neri e ricci uno era pi alto e magro ma comunque muscoloso biondo miele il terzo era smilzo meno robusto coni capelli rossicci e spettinati sembrava molto pi giovane degli altri che avrebbero potuto essere studenti universitari o addirittura insegnanti le ragazze erano sedute di fronte a loro quella pi alta era statuaria il genere di bellezza che si vede nei cataloghi di costumi da bagno di quelle che infliggono duri colpi allautostima delle altre donne aveva capelli dorati che le accarezzavano la schiana con unonda delicata la ragazza pi bassa era una specie di folletto magrissima dai tratti molto delicati i suoi capelli erano neri corvini corti e scompigliati eppure cera qualcosa che li rendeva tutti somiglianti ognuno di loro era pallido come il gesso erano i pi pallidi tra tutti gli studenti di quella citt senza sole pi pallidi di me lalbina tutti avevano occhi molto scuri a dispetto del colore dei capelli e cerchiati da ombre molto pesanti violacee simili a lividi quasi avessere tutti trascorso la notte senza chiudere occhio o si stessero riprendendo da una rissa eppure il resto dei loro lineamenti era dritti perfetto spigoloso ma non era questo il motivo per cui non riuscivo a distogliere lo sguardo li fissavo perch i loro volti cos indifferenti cos simili erano tutti di una bellezza devastante inumana erano volti che non ci si aspetterebbe mai di vedere se non forse sulle pagine patinate di un giornale di moda o dipinti da un vecchio maestro sotto fattezze di angeli
9228571 lamore sempre paziente e gentile non mai geloso lamore non mai presuntuoso o pieno di se non mai scortese o egoista non si offende e non porta rancore lamore non prova soddisfazione per i peccati degli altri ma si delizia della verit sempre pronto a scusare a dare fiducia a sperare e a resistere a qualsiasi tempesta
9228572 sai jacob se non fosse che siamo nemici giurati e che ti piacerebbe rubarmi la mia unica ragione di vita penso che mi andresti a genio
9228573 forse se non fossi un vampiro disgustoso che ha in programma di succhiare la vita alla ragazza che amo be no nemmeno in quel caso
9228574 lasciamo perdere i limiti temporali se vuoi che sia a compiere il gesto lo far ma ad una condizione
9228575 pi che altro sogno di restare con te per sempre
9228576 stammi a sentire ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
9228577 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
9228578 la gente pensa che la vita sia una strada dritta ma sbaglia la vita un circolo un maledetto cerchio che gira in tondo alla fine ti ritrovi in mano esattamente quello che avevi allinizio e finisci per tornare al luogo da cui sei venuto
9228579 mi rimasto cos poco a cui aggrapparmi e non voglio che mi venga tolto
9228580 ti sbagli la realt ce li strappa a uno a uno

9228590 washington ap a federal appeals court says the government can prohibit meat packers from testing their animals for mad cow disease
9228591 insist there is no targeted operation against militants rather it is a haphazard armed invasion on the people of swat
9228592 they have given numerous examples where militants could have been apprehended or attacks on civilians could have been averted had the security forces acted with diligence

9228598 watch out that you dont marry me and honeymoon with him
9228599 oh yeah thats kamal no i dont know why were physically identical
9228600 maybe all men got one big soul everybodys a part of all faces are the same man
9228601 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9228602 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9228603 when you see one of the best backs in the country laying there in pain its definitely something that you dont want to see
9228604 beanies a tough guy i know were all pulling for him hes gone to the doctors and hell do whatever he can to help this team out
9228605 i was a little nervous but you should be my teammates helped me
9228606 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9228607 it looks like theyre incredibly well prepared much better than they had before
9228608 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
9228609 ive seen the account stated from both the u n and certainly from the afghan government ive also seen it discussed that in fact that didnt happen
9228610 we know that when collateral damage occurs that it really does set us back so we work exceptionally hard to make sure that doesnt happen
9228611 were looking to do that as rapidly as we can
9228612 he was very well turned out and always had the best gear
9228613 he was a good shot he would wear shooting suits tweeds but was casual if we were just going clay pigeon he was a millionaire and lived the lifestyle
9228614 this just doesnt happen to your own family its like something you see on tv its horrendous we just cant believe it
9228615 chris was fine just his normal self they all were they are very nice and a very close family chris is very much a family man who loves animals and children he supported his daughter in her horse riding
9228616 about 12 people worked for the company he was hard working and very hands on in those days he wasnt afraid of getting his hands dirty
9228617 he appreciated a good sale but im surprised he made it so big but he did come up with a very good product
9228618 he liked to be the big man in some way
9228619 he would have told people he was a millionaire he was not then personally wealthy but the company was doing okay
9228620 it looks like a man in a state of depression faced by the threat of his house being repossessed deciding to take his familys lives to protect them from poverty that is the fantasy
9228621 our thoughts and prayers are with those who love them
9228622 he is feeling better today he started fasting from this morning and he will continue till evening the doctors say that there is nothing to worry about
9228623 put concerted non violent efforts to bring a natural end to the torture and persecution in tibet
9228624 this is a very solemn moment for all the tibetans
9228625 this is a time to reflect on how we did this year for freedom and a moment to pause and think for ourselves in these trying times of our history
9228626 its looking more likely than it was before these meetings
9228627 he said that he doubted that there was any common ground
9228628 whats troubling is that even if it was the israelis it happened in damascus in a safe area meters from the office of intelligence chief assef shawkat
9228629 the americans are making up stories about me and hold me responsible for a lot of attacks against them that happened around the world
9228630 sometimes they think of me as if i have the key to the universe it is difficult for them to understand that i am part of an institution that patiently plans and designs its moves
9228631 our aim is for every single school to welcome children from all backgrounds it is a simple goal strongly supported by the public educationalists and students
9228632 there are those who attend church in order that their children qualify for admission to a particular school and never set foot in the church again after the children have been accepted
9228633 all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9228634 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9228635 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children the bottom line is that faith schools are successful thriving popular and here to stay
9228636 it is down to locally accountable councils and communities themselves not some campaign group to decide what sort of schools they should have
9228637 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9228638 the first national polls on john mccains pick of sarah palin yesterday came out today from rasmussen and gallup and contrary to what the gop probably hoped she scored less well with women than men
9228639 heres a finding from gallup among democratic women including those who may be disappointed that hillary clinton did not win the democratic nomination 9 say palin makes them more likely to support mccain 15 less likely
9228640 from rasmussen some 38 of men said they were more likely to vote for mccain now but only 32 of women
9228641 except for the one that he accepted as his vp
9228642 youre here not because you are good but just because you are black and we need to look like we are a diverse company
9228643 quick name his top 3 achievements in the us senate
9228644 in 1984 palin won the miss wasilla beauty contest then finished second in the miss alaska pageant 4 at which she won a college scholarship
9228645 im very confident that there will be an absolute clearance for mr peters in a relatively short period of time
9228646 sarah palin is pro development and is supportive of oil and gas development in an environmentally conscious way but she is very tough on the companies she doesnt think that when the state of alaska leases oil and gas to big oil it means big oil gets to call all the shots
9228647 she may face down the oil companies in alaska when it comes to the pipeline but she is singing their tune when it comes to energy policy
9228648 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party
9228649 more than anyones work its the price of gas that is making this pipeline go ahead
9228650 the gas pipeline was such a muddle when she arrived that i thought to myself that this will never be built
9228651 gov palin didnt submit to the force and control of the large companies she forced them into a fair open competitive process
9228652 she was unsettled and unhappy that he was conducting party business on state time
9228653 i came here to pick up my daughter because in this area the flooding can get up to your chest
9228654 we do forecast it to reach category 5 but whether it is a category 4 or 5 it is extremely dangerous either way
9228655 were hoping that its going to settle down enough that we can do some damage assessment
9228656 im expecting the hms iron duke early and theyre going to be providing significant assistance in our damage assessment operations
9228657 it is all wet and i am afraid to sleep inside there
9228658 i ts ok if the republicans nominated somebody for vice president who needs a little warm up time til they become president
9228659 a very bright woman and very good she would be an excellent choice but i think that he sen john mccain needs someone with a little more experience
9228660 i ts ok if the republicans nominated somebody for vice president who needs a little warm up time til they become president
9228661 but were embracing sarah palin to go against joe biden for vice president
9228662 and no cheese or sour cream just lots of lettuce and please put the guacamole on the side
9228663 i shouldve eaten him when he was born like hamsters do
9228664 im out alone imoutimoutimout ohmygod im never out alone whatdoido whatdoido i guess i go here no i go over there no i wander aimlessly looking at things yes yesyesyes thats what i do now why am i here
9228665 really youre crying again oh yeah youre life is so hard you get to nap all day then we feed you burp you sing to you play with you change your diaper wipe your ass and then you get to sleep again stop complaining
9228666 i will only eat baby oatmeal bananas and applesauce for 9 freakin months
9228667 ten amos mucha relaci n incluso le pegu un tiro a su hija en una cacer a
9228668 i didnt want to be a practice squad guy i didnt want to be a special teams guy i wanted to beat plax out
9228669 he really has played the best of that second group of linemen
9228670 weve always considered him the first guy in if we had anything to contend with we stuck him in there at tackle where he has practiced a little bit just to make sure he understood he has to know guard and tackle
9228671 we have to make decisions first of all on what is the condition of lawrence tynes
9228672 its from that decision the decision from the medical people that we have to make the right decision for our team well have to see where that goes
9228673 it is hard to imagine palin playing the same sort of role that modern vice presidents like gore bush cheney or mondale played
9228674 i have never seen him lose his temper and he was no more stressed by business than anyone else
9228675 but it is those who bottle it up that can end up cracking
9228676 the remains will be examined by a home office pathologist and postmortem examinations are due to be carried out to establish the cause of death
9228677 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed
9228678 theres a feeling that the west treats russia merely as a loser in the cold war which has to play by the winners rules
9228679 putin was expecting some reciprocity for joining the antiterrorist coalition what he got instead was further nato expansion to russias back yard and aggressive pipeline policy to weaken russias position in the energy market
9228680 the sooner europe equips itself to confront the challenges of a resurgent russia the better
9228681 theres the danger that things could be left in such a poisonous state that the next administration has no options and finds it difficult to get on a productive track
9228682 david miliband was caught short now he is running around trying to play catch up
9228683 whether it wants to suffer isolation and loss of respect
9228684 theres always the possibility and the fear in peoples minds
9228685 the russians havent cut off gas supplies to consumers in western europe before but that is no guarantee they wont do so
9228686 gazprom relies as much on europe as europe depends on our gas
9228687 i must admit that by my own measurement this would be an exaggeration the economy appears to be surviving rather better than he suggests i was surprised by his language
9228688 this hardly gives activists a morale boost we are out on the doorstep trying to reassure people at the same time as darling is telling them we are all doomed
9228689 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9228690 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess that 10 years of labour have left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9228691 it is insane to push pilots to fly with the minimum fuel and take the risk of ending with a low fuel situation and maybe no place to go because the only diversion airport within reach will be mobbed by other aeroplanes
9228692 no pilot is allowed to fly with minimum fuel as these clowns claim
9228693 thats all right thats what im going to have to be able to do go in there at any notice
9228694 facebook blocks the registration of a number of names that are frequently abused on the site
9228695 the name yoda also being the name of a popular star wars character is on this list of blocked names
9228696 impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent yourself
9228697 register for a user account on behalf of an individual other than yourself
9228698 its funny in spots but i dont think its broadly commercial its very english
9228699 maybe it was due to the vacuum left by the writers strike earlier this year but this summer was dominated by british originated pro gramming
9228700 entertainment 19 run by former spice girls manager simon fuller and presenter simon cowell were smart when they rebooted pop idol for the american audience with texting votes
9228701 we had a similar old show star search but nothing that drew television audiences like that idol is still the juggernaut
9228702 mark burnett a former british army paratrooper may have started the american reality craze with survivor but right now entertainment 19 are the biggest brits in american television
9228703 the mark of power in hollywood is getting your phone calls answered and there are few in this town who will not take a call from simon cowell no matter what you think of his on screen persona
9228704 they dont get the joke they have dead handed it into just another cop show
9228705 watching bbc america on a high definition wide screen gives me a headache i import my britcom dvds rather than wait two years for the censored versions
9228706 even dr who is shown on other american channels before it reaches the bbc
9228707 its great keeping the british accents just makes it better
9228708 brits bring focus and intelligence and they stick within budget
9228709 unamerican global sensitivities and the freedom to make fast decisions unlike the strictly hierarchical us studio system
9228710 he has extraordinary taste every year there is another hit out of the blue like juno that rocks the world
9228711 he has bad years but overall he dominates low cost smart movie making like harvey weinstein used to do but unlike harvey you never see him mouthing off in the press
9228712 they have to come to hollywood to learn how to take risks back in britain the culture is still risk averse
9228713 no studio attached yes it keeps me awake at night
9228714 one character asks if it was time for a cup of tea
9228715 not somebody i would like to be stuck with in a hot air balloon
9228716 its cyclic last year it was kate winslet and dame helen mirren and they could be back next year or maybe it says something about our brooding times
9228717 the next sean connery if he can get the right role
9228718 hes definitely a better shooter than i thought he has a great touch around the rim and as young as he is he actually knows how to play the game in the pickup games hes gotten the ball in the post and has made some pretty good moves i think he has to get more physical inside
9228719 but the thing is he knows how to pass the ball i was cutting and trying to see how he thinks and he knows how to pass the ball hell find the open man in the paint or outside hes a guy who has impressed me the most cdr is doing well and ryan is a great shooter but i think brook stands out the most being young i thought hed be kind of intimidated by this level but hes not
9228720 i havent seen that toughness and im sure everyones going to work on that especially the coaches hes very young and thats easy to do now that were playing pickup games hes seen different guys hes seen me trying to get physical hes asking questions hell get it done early in training camp im going to go at him hard even though hes a lot taller than me toughness is something you develop and you do it fast you just have to work at it every day

9228722 he offered to start me off at ten thousand dollars the first year with a two thousand dollar travel allowance to buy a car the salary would go up if things worked out after he was gone i took the long way home along the east river promenade and tried to figure out what to make of the man he was smart i decided he seemed committed to his work still there was something about him that made me wary a little too sure of himself maybe and white hed said himself that that was a problem

9228731 do you think that next time you could do home economics
9228732 so many times that when something actually does happen thats positive its shocking to me like if someone threw a bucket of ice cold water on my head
9228733 i guess i wouldnt mind a pair of small well behaved boys
9228734 this new found internal candor is far more satisfying than could have been predicted it feels empowering to believe to have found a tool useful overcome future difficulties at present i find myself in a vein of belief swept up in it it seems to flow over the otherwise mundane details of everyday life and take the devil right out of them only in honesty is there hope

9229061 apakah permintaanmu hai ratu ester niscaya akan dikabulkan dan apakah keinginanmu sampai setengah kerajaan sekalipun akan dipenuhi
9229062 ya raja jikalau hamba mendapat kasih raja dan jikalau baik pada pemandangan raja karuniakanlah kiranya kepada hamba nyawa hamba atas permintaan hamba dan bangsa hamba atas keinginan hamba 7 4 karena kami hamba serta bangsa hamba telah terjual untuk dipunahkan dibunuh dan dibinasakan jikalau seandainya kami hanya dijual sebagai budak laki laki dan perempuan niscaya hamba akan berdiam diri tetapi malapetaka ini tiada taranya di antara bencana yang menimpa raja

9229069 here this will look good on you go try it on
9229070 the establishment of democracy on the american continent was scarcely as radical a break with the past as was the necessity which americans faced of broadening this concept to include black men
9229071 mccain voted 90 of the time with bush i dont know about you but i dont want to take a 10 chance on change
9229072 john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes but we are the one who will pay for his flip flops
9229073 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9229074 it should be hanging upon my line right now but no here i am dragging 24 it up realsteep hill with my idiot son at my side now why is this i ask myself
9229075 because the aforementioned idiot son had confused tadpoles with tadpole shaped spermatozoa he had mixed up ovaries with ovaltune malt drink and attempted to create life not in vitro but in vaselone protective jelly and the incubator for this freakish creation somewhere damp and warm my washing machine to be exact and now something has clogged my machine and the town sewer i just hope that with its first breath it doesnt call you daddy
9229076 i wish we lived at the bottom of the hill
9229077 then we wouldnt have to walk all the way up the hill to go home
9229078 that would be a good idea but wouldnt we have to move hamster heath to the top of the hill to compensate that would mean that you would have to walk up the hill to school
9229079 but i could ride my scooter to school then i could get there three times as fast so i could leave home three times as late
9229080 where the fluffing heck does the river come into it
9229081 at the end of the valley thats where only it wouldnt itd be on the top of the hill with hamster heath
9229082 water flows downhill it would start by miss gultrots shop and race down the hill to where septum bridge is now and probably wash it away
9229083 you mean the one who married his own auntie and then
9229084 that was uncle doris the mixed up chap who married his own cousin jeremy no i mean uncle boris who married your auntie svetlana
9229085 yes as in yes i remember him and what about him
9229086 ill have to get off my arse dust polish and make the house nicer than nice
9229087 and hurt their feelings theyve come all the way from the russian steppes to visit us theyve even taken a vow of herbivorness they promise not to kill any passers by and eat them we cant let them down
9229088 but mum i cant stand one more of his boring anecdotes if he tells me how he once bought two shirts of almost the same shade but very slightly different in a certain light ill die horribly
9229089 tell you what next time he goes on and on about how he once got his willy caught in a butterfly valve just think about an episode of rat trek just imagine the adventures of captain perp and mister splatt thatll cheer you up
9229090 i have a counter suggestion you buy me the season four box set of rat trek on dvd and ill go to my room and watch it
9229091 the christian cannot be satisfied so long as any human activity is either opposed to christianity or out of all connection with christianity christianity must pervade not merely all nations but also all of human thought
9229092 an uncertain revolution why the rise of a genetic model of mental illness has not increased tolerance
9229093 in the case of schizophrenia genetic arguments are associated with fears regarding violence
9229094 in fact attributing schizophrenia to genes is no different from attributing it to bad character either way americans see those with schizophrenia as damaged in some essential way and therefore likely to be violent however when applied to depression genetic arguments have very different connotations they are associated with social acceptance if you imagine that someones depression is a genetic problem the condition seems more real and less blameworthy its in their genes theyre not weak so i should accept them for who they are
9229095 while the stigma surrounding mental illness has not diminished the rate of treatment for psychiatric disorders has increased
9229096 the culture surrounding mental illness has become more treatment focused with direct to consumer advertising of psychiatric medications now a mainstay of popular media
9229097 i think we are going to know when we find it
9229098 our readers are both male and female models photographers artists fashion designers fitness gurus casting and modeling agents and all those who like to know about the current fashion trends for men and which faces are hot in the male modeling world right now most of all our readers are the ones with the minds that carry the positive image of man they live healthy dress well and treat one another with respect
9229099 though it might seem to others that the magazine is changing slowly from issue to issue its not changing the format its basically laying the foundations for more powerful achievements to come those who believe in apollo male models will support and share this wonderful adventure with us for many years talents never fade away
9229100 there are many best things about being a publisher of major modeling magazine but the one thing that i always cherish the most are the opportunities in knowing all these wonderful talented people all over the world
9229101 i either dress casual to show i take good care of my body or dress to show my personality im a leo by the month and a rooster by the year and i go by the spiritual name of apollo you figure it out lol
9229102 for new models stop looking in the mirror once a while and look at what is going on in the fashion and fitness industries to see where you fit in and where you stand out
9229103 it is difficult for me to pick just one that i like the most because i put so much effort into every issue and make them individually special so our readers collect them all and not just buying the current and ignore the past
9229104 everywhere just look and learn to appreciate and you will see inspiration from everything every place and everyone
9229105 the most important lesson that i learned from the models and photographers that ive worked with is that they believe in themselves and they stand on their grounds
9229106 basically i was bored waiting for someone to give me projects to do i believe there are many talents out there just wishing for a publication to showcase their creativity waiting was a waste of time so i set out to start a magazine on my own that would encompass artistic views of fashion and fitness
9229107 supports even if i can do things alone i rather be able to share that joy of accomplishments because of the supports from others u nderstanding of one another without it well be confused and lost without it compassion will perish kindness it is what makes us human creativity it perks our minds and make the world even more beautiful light it brings us energy and colors of wonders
9229108 simple things like to be visited by a simple creature like a lady bug
9229109 odds are its a boy but well be happy with either sex
9229110 were just hoping for a healthy baby but theres a chance for a boy odds are positive
9229111 it would have been nice to do it on our terms
9229112 we were hoping to be a little further along before news got out
9229113 im absolutely elated and very emotional and just grateful to everyone whos voted for us
9229114 by far this is our most extreme dramatic and deeply disturbing album to date the legend of gilles de rais has been given fresh vampyrical life in this conceptual meisterwerk swathed in pitch black magic and a viciousness unsurpassed in the annals of cradle history screw what our detractors say everyone who has heard this album has bruised their jaws on the pentagram bejewelled floor
9229115 we are strongly strongly encouraging everyone to evacuate and go north
9229116 tourists it is time for you to leave the city do not wait to start the evacuation this storm is starting to be a little tricky we want to encourage everyone to take this storm very seriously
9229117 the next time you hear us the message is going to be get the heck out
9229118 im not asking for people to believe me im asking people to watch and see what were doing
9229119 he knew there were a couple opportunities he could have had
9229120 there was a deep ball he overthrew and a couple of deep balls he underthrew some were completions but if he hits the guy on the run it could have been six points
9229121 we gave up only one sack and that was when our guys were covered downfield we were able to run the ball well today and that says a lot about the offensive line
9229122 i was born and raised in atlanta so i have known what georgia football is about
9229123 really i felt like i was at home today on the first series i felt comfortable but it was real exciting getting out there
9229124 our two quarterbacks played well and they both made good and bad decisions
9229125 receiver kenneth harris probably will miss at least one game with an ankle sprain
9229126 there are always things that are good and things you find to work on
9229127 i know the offense and i knew their defense so i thought id be ok
9229128 i saw an opening and i wasnt going to be denied
9229129 that was my first touchdown and i wanted it bad
9229130 terrelle obviously is a guy who can do some great things
9229131 it was a 35 34 win over missouri that was really an outstanding football game
9229132 missouri was running the split t formation and don faurot was the coach we didnt know how to defend it and not many other schools did either
9229133 fred benners was smus quarterback and smu won 32 27
9229134 benners and this was not a coaching ploy came into the game as smus third string quarterback
9229135 i was once like you i used to ride motorcycles and do all that stuff
9229136 i dont want you doing that i need you alive so we can finish these episodes
9229137 too many americans are not adequately protected against the risks of needing long term care
9229138 we are providing consumers with accurate and timely information so they can better prepare for the unpredictability and soaring expense of long term care
9229139 you can have it high quality fast or cheap pick two of the three
9229140 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
9229141 ive never seen a homeless guy with a bottle of gatorade
9229142 it was a friendship made in stone they were like blood brothers almost
9229143 i knew it was going to be difficult for him
9229144 but when i told him there was shock and disbelief on his face
9229145 i was really concerned about how it would affect him
9229146 we rejoice in our sending back to you what you so graciously extended to us we rejoice in the return of jabir to his lord
9229147 so enshallah one day they will join each other in the hereafter and see each other again

9229151 reprisals on the military joint task force responsible for the killings of men women and children from their so called warning shots in the inland waterways to punitive expeditions on oil bearing communities
9229152 from our count the predominantly ethnic northern jtf lost a total of 29 soldiers in the combined assault we can not account for those that jumped into the water in panic and drowned we lost six of our gallant fighters
9229153 the deadly soviet made anti tank missiles at close range combat
9229154 to witness the wreck of gunboats which were still burning when we left to forestall any denial by the military

9229157 look if you want to enslave yourself with all this thats fine but dont drag me into your misery
9229158 stop wasting time and money chasing agents so you want to avoid what most business owners make the mistake in doing in that they run one advertisement and then pull the plug on campaign

9229168 is this the beginning of the end every loss will rekindle thoughts of a year ago when the mets led the nl east by seven games with 17 to play but collapsed and failed to reach the playoffs when you flop like that it takes more than a calendar year to get over it
9229169 the rascals that have been hanging around us for a whole year we have to face that every time we lose a game like tuesday night were reminded of that so weve got to face it confront it deal with it and move on

9229247 i just tried to play to my very best at 2 0 we started to play at a lower standard i think we were a bit scared and could have finished the match better
9229248 i regret not benig able to hold on to the ball better but overall im satisfied
9229249 i admire horaus defensive play and he gave us a precious lift with the set pieces
9229250 the result was fair because we werent able to close out the match but a draw at a difficult ground is not a big drama
9229251 im not super happy but the team didnt play badly
9229252 i expressed my transfer desires several months ago but with respect to the club if the decision to not bring them is taken it will come from the president massimo moratti
9229253 i need a quick player on the flanks my choice was quaresma but porto arent selling the player its not a big problem
9229254 we showed the valencia of last year that finished 10th in the league is a thing of the past
9229255 the club wanted to keep me and i feel comfortable here so it is all fine it is just nice to get back to scoring goals
9229256 the team did well and we won so i am happy although we suffered far too much in the final few minutes
9229257 i made the decision hes under pressure from his entourage and not fit to play

9229261 as far as on tv this is the perfect time to have a game thats away right at lunch time people are hungry so they come in to eat lunch
9229262 most people dont have eleven foot screens at their house to watch the game on so its a big deal
9229263 even if its home or away we usually are still packed because people who dont have tickets will come here and watch it on tv

9229267 as relaxed with an at bat as ive been in a week
9229268 we needed to win and i felt we just gave it away we had a 6 2 lead and those are the games you should win
9229269 they were pretty lifeless until we made a mistake there and they took full advantage of it
9229270 this was a game we thought we had its a frustrating game we just wish we could be happier right now
9229271 i hit it hard and he made an unbelievable play

9229301 if this guy is as good a wing guard as either one of those guys we should know more about him
9229302 you have to say hes got a great name for a wing guard
9229303 he talked about how to be successful the importance of studying to have other interests
9229304 from that point forward i had a tremendous respect for him
9229305 he remembered who i was and how many points i scored against him in the 1975 championship game

9229331 unless i am convinced by the testimony of the scriptures or by clear reason for i do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted themselves i am bound by the scriptures i have quoted and my conscience is captive to the word of god i cannot and i will not retract anything since it is neither sale nor right to go against conscience

9229338 on the far side of the river valley the road passed through a stark black burn charred and limbless trunks of trees stretching away on every side ash moving over the road and the sagging hands of blind wire strung from the blackened lightpoles whining thinly in the wind a burned house in a clearing and beyond that a reach of meadowlands stark and gray and a raw red mudbank where a roadworks lay abandoned farther along were billboards advertising motels everything as it once had been save faded and weathered at the top of the hill they stood in the cold and the wind getting their breath he looked at the boy im all right the boy said the man put his hand on his shoulder and nodded toward the open country below them he got the binoculars out of the cart and stood in the road and glassed the plain down there where the shape of a city stood in the grayness like a charcoal drawing sketched across the waste nothing to see no smoke can i see the boy said yes of course you can the boy leaned on the cart and adjusted the wheel what do you see the man said nothing he lowered the glasses its raining yes the man said i know they left the cart in a gully covered with the tarp and made their way up the slope through the dark poles of the standing trees to where hed seen a running ledge of rock and they sat under the rock overhang and watched the gray sheets of rain blow across the valley it was very cold they sat huddled together wrapped each in a blanket over their coats and after a while the rain stopped and there was just the dripping in the woods when it had cleared they went down to the cart and pulled away the tarp and got their blankets and the things they would need for the night they went back up the hill and made their camp in the dry dirt under the rocks and the man sat with his arms around the boy trying to warm him wrapped in the blankets watching the nameless dark come to enshroud them the gray shape of the city vanished in the nights onset like an apparition and he lit the little lamp and set it back out of the wind then they walked out to the road and he took the boys hand and they went to the top of the hill where the road crested and where they could see out over the darkening country to the south standing there in the wind wrapped in their blankets watching for any sign of a fire or a lamp there was nothing the lamp in the rocks on the side of the hill was little more than a mote of light and after a while they walked back everything too wet to make a fire they ate their poor meal cold and lay down in their bedding with the lamp between them hed brought the boys book but the boy was too tired for reading can we leave the lamp on till im asleep he said yes of course we can

9229344 what cocaine does is to block its reuptake it does this by hitting a molecule called the dopamine transporter bonding to and thus disabling it as more cocaine is taken the more dopamine transporters are kept busy the less dopamine is reabsorbed thus the more dopamine there is floating around the better you feel
9229345 according to animal studies ritalin and cocaine act so much alike that they even compete for the same binding sites on neurons
9229346 the laboratory procedures that led to the new york times reporting that monkeys hooked up intravenously will inject themselves with cocaine repeatedly rejecting food sex and sleep also led to the finding not reported by the times that lab animals given the choice to self administer comparable doses of cocaine and ritalin do not favor one over the other

9229421 wie oft haben wir in den letzten jahren solche und hnliche meldungen lesen m ssen
9229422 meist handelte es sich um vorf lle im irak und die beteiligten waren fast immer us soldaten die vorf lle der letzten tage 90 get tete zivilisten 10 get tete franz sische soldaten ein toter bundeswehr soldat haben gezeigt dass die sicherheitslage in afghanistan sich zunehmend verschlechtert und dass die besatzungstruppen weiter unter druck geraten

9229438 the big campaign of the summer has been respect and barton showed little of it there
9229439 joey came on got a good tackle in on nasri then the guy sliced him down thats what happened and thats what i saw which is what i was upset about
9229440 i know the referee didnt see it but the linesman did and it should have been a red card
9229441 it wasnt a reckless tackle it was a good tackle

9229484 i think were going to have to examine our tag line dangerously inexperienced
9229485 lets stop pretending this race is as close as national polling suggests the truth is mccain is essentially tied or trailing in every swing state that matters and too close for comfort in several states like indiana and montana the gop usually wins pretty easily in presidential races
9229486 lets face it this is not the pick of a self confident candidate it is the political equivalent of a trick play or as some democrats called it a hail mary pass in football mccain talks incessantly about experience and then goes and selects a woman he hardly knows who hardly knows foreign policy and who can hardly be seen as instantly ready for the presidency
9229487 like a driver overcorrecting out of a swerve he chooses someone who is two years younger than the youthful obama
9229488 if he had room to maneuver there were lots of people mccain could have selected who would have represented a break from washington politics as usual sen joseph i lieberman comes to mind he had no such room gop stalwarts were furious over trial balloons about the possibility of choosing a supporter of abortion rights

9229492 pets can and often do react to their owners distress or discomfort but that is not to be confused with experiencing the emotion of empathy
9229493 do not have the cognitive capacity to put themselves in our place
9229494 there is some very suggestive evidence that at least some animals such as higher primates and elephants do empathize
9229495 when i returned from the cancer center following treatment i was extremely weak and ill
9229496 suddenly jumped up in bed next to my husband almost plastered to his side he normally never did this preferring to sleep on his cushion next to my side of the bed he kept trembling for one hour and then went down stairs by himself which is another action he did not normally do leaving the bedroom at night my husband suffered a massive heart attack and died a few minutes later i believe that robbie knew that something awful was to be
9229497 my chloe came up got as close as she could and placed her paw on my left chest over my heart within a very short time the palpitations slowed and stopped allowing me to get a good nights rest
9229498 completely cutting off his windpipe i believe due to the extreme oddness of similarity to our illness that my cat literally tried to take on my disease he did get me through all of this
9229499 without my two dogs companionship dealing with the loss of my wife would have been much harder i can see why many people die soon after losing a spouse we need love to carry on
9229500 make me feel wanted needed loved they bring joy and happiness into my dark sad existence
9229501 has given me the desire to get out of bed and on many days given me the will to live
9229502 las redes de tr fico de personas llegan a hungr a para ofrecer a nuestras j venes empleo en m xico les presentan contratos de trabajo muy tentadores garantiz ndoles buen salario vivienda seguro y visa de trabajo en letras peque as se les especifica que trabajar n en bares s lo en contadas ocasiones les indican que realmente ir n a parar a un table dance
9229503 a vanesa seguramente la ten a enganchada una red muy escondida como hay muchas operando en el pa s hasta en casas particulares como cualquiera sin que los vecinos reparen que ah viven mujeres esclavizadas
9229504 en el proceso de trata internacional bastan s lo tres personas para integrar una banda la persona que engancha a la v ctima en su pa s de origen la que hace el traslado y finalmente quien se encarga de su explotaci n en el extranjero
9229505 por eso debemos quitarnos la idea de que el tratante es el t pico mafioso mal encarado con pistola traje fino y lentes oscuros no puede ser la gente de aspecto m s com n incluso hasta los mismos familiares de la v ctima
9229506 el enganche se da com nmente a trav s de falsas ofertas de trabajo el tipo que llega y te dice te tengo un trabajo muy bien remunerado en el extranjero no pagar s ni transporte ni hospedaje se da tambi n el enganche por enamoramiento del chico que te seduce y promete cambiar tu vida hasta llegar al extremo del rapto y del secuestro
9229507 lograr detectarlas es la labor m s dif cil para nosotros puesto que viven escondidas y bajo amenazas permanentes
9229508 en los tres a os que llevamos trabajando en m xico s lo hemos atendido a 70 v ctimas de explotaci n sexual y laboral les proporcionamos albergue asistencia m dica y sicol gica y en colaboraci n con las embajadas gestionamos la reunificaci n con sus respectivas familias
9229509 son gente bien entrenada con gran peligrosidad se presume que pertenecieron a la kgb lo que tenemos documentado es la forma de actuar de esta gente que es principalmente tr fico de armas prostituci n y tr fico de drogas
9229510 los grupos de mujeres de europa del este llegan a m xico bien enganchados con guardias que los vigilan en todo momento los tratantes observan c mo se relacionan las mujeres entre s escogen a la de car cter m s fuerte para que dirija al grupo siempre y cuando sea fiel a ellos
9229511 aun as en ocasiones las j venes se rebelan es entonces cuando la mafia rusa suele recurrir al asesinato mata a una de ellas como escarmiento para que las dem s se disciplinen medida de control mucho m s eficaz que la simple amenaza de agredir a alg n familiar de las j venes en realidad este m todo no tiene nada de novedoso ya lo practicaban las poquianchis en guanajuato
9229512 ah pr cticamente convergen todas las mafias por lo que se puede ver a la morena tra da de la habana a la brasile a de r o de janeiro o a la checa ojiazul es la ley de la oferta y la demanda el libre tr nsito de mercanc as en un mundo globalizado
9229513 las extranjeras m s afortunadas son transportadas en avi n y hospedadas en c modas suites para despu s introducirlas en la prostituci n de alto nivel
9229514 a n a ese nivel existen tres categor as platino oro y diamante las de sta ltima categor a seg n testimonios que nos dan las propias trabajadoras sexuales llegan a cobrar hasta 20 mil pesos por un polvo como las bellas j venes que la empresa televisa oferta muy encubiertamente en traje de ba o en su programa sabatino de televisi n mu vete conducido por maribel guardia y latin lover
9229515 estos empresarios viajan constantemente al extranjero buscando innovaciones para sus negocios por ejemplo el table dance de ra z oriental lo introdujo pancho soto a m xico y ortiz suzumo fue el primero en utilizar los cat logos con fotograf as de las muchachas
9229516 esta trata se efect a por cuatro rutas que las autoridades tienen bien definidas la ruta del pac fico dos rutas centrales y por ltimo la del golfo
9229517 en 1998 supimos que llegar a un cargamento con 70 menores de edad al hotel liverpool en la merced un grupo compuesto por asamble stas y miembros de brigada callejera alert personalmente al entonces procurador del distrito federal samuel del villar ste les dijo yo prefiero quedarme aqu quietecito porque adem s esta procuradur a es una cloaca donde no se puede confiar en nadie les aconsejo que no se metan si es que no quieren aparecer muertos en una esquina la procuradur a finalmente mand un operativo al hotel y pesc a los tratantes pero luego los dej libres
9229518 otro ejemplo son los gobiernos estatales de quer taro que desde hace a os regentean el burdel la yegua situado en la ciudad de quer taro donde a su vez cada alcalde se traspasa uno a otro el burdel el farall n que deja buenos dividendos al municipio
9229519 alrededor de las zonas militares hay burdeles para uso exclusivo del ej rcito el campo militar n mero uno est rodeado de ellos y as podr amos seguir enumerando m s y m s y m s casos de prostituci n institucionalizada respecto a la trata de extranjeras no hay que rascarle mucho para comprobar que las autoridades migratorias tambi n est n metidas en el negocio
9229520 podr a ser un sue o guajiro de nuestra parte pero necesitamos ver avances en materia de procuraci n de justicia
9229521 en europa el mercado de la prostituci n ya est saturado principalmente en espa a gran breta a italia y francia los peri dicos de esos pa ses publican un mont n de ofertas de manera que a las jovencitas h ngaras rumanas o checas se les comenz a enviar a nuevos lugares
9229522 al principio alemania fue una salida despu s los pa ses del norte europeo pero ah las j venes no fueron bien aceptadas a ellas tampoco les gust el clima helado de esos pa ses donde por meses no se ve ni el sol
9229523 seg n nuestros informes habr unas 150 j venes h ngaras trabajando en bares hoteles moteles table dances y restaurantes principalmente en la ciudad de m xico canc n y acapulco trabajan s lo en lugares cerrados nunca se les ve en la calle
9229524 generalmente tienen entre 22 y 27 a os de edad por desgracia all en hungr a es muy mala su situaci n econ mica y tienen un bajo nivel de estudios caen f cilmente en este mercado de la globalizaci n pensando que con su cuerpo tendr n un mejor nivel en m xico
9229525 generalmente esos contratos son por tres meses al cabo de los cuales ellas se dan cuenta que el salario no era tan bueno entonces se les dice que tendr n que hacer otras cosas si quieren ganar m s como trabajar cubiertas s lo con una tanga o prestarse a ciertos requerimientos sexuales
9229526 quienes aceptan quedarse en m xico empiezan a ser v ctimas de chantajes y amenazas debido a que sus pasaportes y papeles migratorios se quedan en poder de sus empleadores no pueden moverse libremente muchas veces s lo pueden ir al lugar donde trabajan y a donde viven vigiladas siempre por guardias una moderna forma de esclavitud
9229527 esas agencias rentan locales por corto tiempo y publican sus ofertas de trabajo en los peri dicos desaparecen cuando la polic a est a punto de detectarlas no dejan huella se instalan despu s en otro lugar en hungr a operan principalmente en las ciudades de budapest miskolc debrecen y eger se sabe que sus directivos se la pasan viajando por toda europa del este
9229528 el mercado mexicano tiene tambi n un l mite ya lo empezamos a ver pongo como ejemplo la actual lucha entre las mujeres argentinas y las h ngaras unas con otras se disputan los espacios y las mejores ganancias se delatan mutuamente ante las autoridades migratorias
9229529 en los ltimos tres meses las argentinas lograron sacar de m xico a 10 h ngaras que fueron capturadas en el distrito federal veracruz acapulco y canc n en la embajada tuvimos que intervenir en otras ocasiones nuestras jovencitas acuden a la embajada en busca de protecci n

9229532 we either get hillarys voters and we win or we dont its not a mystery
9229533 nuestras instituciones y autoridades no est n respondiendo al reto que representa la delincuencia aparentemente no hay una se al de esperanza
9229534 es el mismo problema los mismos diagn sticos que ten amos hace diez a os casi nada ha cambiado
9229535 de que la gente pide ahora acciones protecci n a cambio de votos e impuestos

9229539 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
9229540 that you please leave feedback as soon as possible so i can delete the item from my list
9229541 while chewing on the toy a vacuum was created and it effectively sucked his tongue into the hole in the ball from speaking with my vet this likely occurred because there is not a second hole in the ball preventing the vacuum effect from happening
9229542 its been devastating chai was depressed he was in pain and he couldnt chew his food
9229543 im angry because it all could have been prevented because there was evidence of this a long time ago

9229553 gustav has continued to strengthen and now has maximum winds near 145 miles per hour 233 kilometers per hour
9229554 really i just did not expect this it has been a long time since we have been hit by such a powerful hurricane and this gustav looks like it will be quite strong
9229555 were hoping that its going to settle down enough that we can do some damage assessment
9229556 im expecting the hms iron duke early and theyre going to be providing significant assistance in our damage assessment operations

9229577 whaanga coast for the first 15 20 kilometres was alright then in the slower parts through the trees it was really hard this would be a great result but now we really need to push if i can get a good rhythm i believe we have a chance to stay ahead

9229614 all of the songs are sculpted out of lifes hard lessons

9229618 no ser a conveniente organizar un evento festivo bajo la amenaza de una tragedia terrible como un desastre nacional
9229619 i think that definitely the wimbledon win helped me a lot to change my mentality to realize not every thing has to be perfect all the time
9229620 thats helped me to if i dont have a perfect practice i dont get really upset about the whole tournament
9229621 if i can get my racket on the ball its not too bad
9229622 im a tall guy as well its up near my shoulders where other guys its toward their head against a guy like him theres a sense of urgency to every point especially when hes serving
9229623 i think shes playing really well and im glad she feels like shes playing her best
9229624 its nice to feel like when youre playing your best right now im not playing my best but that means i can do so much better
9229625 i think im the wrong guy to ask about that obviously we are brothers and now there are even more similarities because weve both proven we have the ability to win a championship
9229626 i guess im just happy for tiki that hes making a smooth transition into the tv world
9229627 ill be interested to see if he has anything to say about a team besides the giants
9229628 when you win that super bowl mvp trophy i think you take ownership of a lot of things you not only get the accolade but the reins of the team too
9229629 i think eli has always been confident in his abilities and confident in himself but i think there is a progression and we talked about it this time last year i know a lot of people had him on the hot seat the great thing about eli is that he has been consistent he has always put in the time and work i think that is what his teammates admire about him
9229630 i know there was criticism but it never affected me i just had to continue to work hard
9229631 i think that the thing thats encouraging to me is that hes throwing the ball better than he did a year ago
9229632 i dont think a quarterback reaches his full potential until his sixth or seventh year
9229633 the most power emissary for ocean conservation in our history
9229634 they are trying to shift blame from themselves to the striped bass for the collapse of salmon and delta smelt when it is in fact massive exports of fresh water from the california delta that have resulted in the dramatic fish declines
9229635 the fire danger in the forest is higher than it was when the 16 000 acre power and 8 000 acre freds fires started in 2004 its higher than 2001 when the 16 000 acre star fire started and its higher than 1992 when the 24 500 acre cleveland fire started

9229658 im sure some people think were not aggressive and are crybabies and will get blown away
9229659 sports is a marketing arm without trying to be a marketing arm
9229660 all you have to do is play and of course if you win that goes up
9229661 i would have jumped at this chance as a student
9229662 i tried to stay off the internet and just in my experience here with all the things that have gone on i really dont listen to the talk or what people expect or anything like that
9229663 i just try to concentrate on what i can do to improve as a player thats not going to change this is my approach
9229664 we have a working relationship and i think we have the same goal and thats to get this team to win
9229665 what theyre discussing i cant change so that subject is what it is
9229666 i control what i can control and get us as good as we can get with what i can control i dont have control of that
9229667 when you take this job you realize who the owner is and you realize most guys dont last really long so that is what it is
9229668 if you sit there and worry about that and you think about that youre not doing the best that you can for your team
9229669 its been a very long week and i think a lot of misspent energy has been taken up by obvious press media players everybody its just so mentally draining to be in this position to listen to read to hear all the b s this week im spent im exhausted i didnt want to finish the last two tournaments like this
9229670 do you know what im sick and tired of all this nonsense
9229671 im absolutely spent i cant waste any more energy on this if i get the call im ready to play and trust me ill do my job
9229672 id say right now im annoyed at not figuring out this golf course very well
9229673 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure its nonsense
9229674 youve read it youve wrote it some of you might be guilty or not i dont know but boy what one hell of a week
9229675 thats pressure thats what you thrive on to have to read all that nonsense listen to all that its totally different pressure ive performed in the big tournaments weve all seen what happens when you get batted for a week it happened earlier on in the year im tired of it
9229676 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9229677 our focus is really on this side of the river
9229678 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9229679 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9229680 i feel as one person who stands up i have a voice and letting it be heard sends fear to the establishment
9229681 some weekends i feel like we have a dominant car and other weekends i feel like were a fifth place car or even a 10th place car
9229682 with the strong team we have we seem to be able to rally back and get finishes out of it so i still think that we are maybe behind
9229683 in different weeks the 88 car earnhardt has been the car the 24 gordon was the car early we were and its just tough to really say where were at
9229684 its been tough for him and its been a huge huge challenge for him
9229685 but more importantly the go to moves that weve always had with the old car do not work with the cot and to kind of retrain chads brain and look at things in a different way that is the hardest part for him
9229686 the latest greatest moves and the stuff we thought was going to work based on the old car and we were not even in the same race
9229687 we were out there in a seven cylinder class it seemed like that has been the hardest part to find out where to work and thats what weve done all season long
9229688 there is not anyone smarter than chad but the way he has thought about setting these cars up and what we have done in the past doesnt work with this new car
9229689 we are trying to find the right direction in the right areas to turn him loose and let him work
9229690 its a lot of small areas and we are now i feel getting the rhythm of this car and understanding what to work on
9229691 this is one of the best things for the healing process
9229692 its awesome what these softball players are doing its a huge lift
9229693 they said theyre trying to get three or four other high school teams involved with the cause its like a chain reaction
9229694 its not about the government we just want the vets to know were here for them
9229695 people like barry zito reaching out to us it means a lot
9229696 wait you traded me for a frickin hamburger wheres the fries and milkshake at least
9229697 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure
9229698 i met mike mccormick a couple of times and he said it would be nice to pass the torch
9229699 i said it would be great to take it from him
9229700 i told him ive been carrying this torch for 41 years and would be pleased to pass it on to him
9229701 he said he had a long way to go and i told him to keep doing what hes doing
9229702 i do like his chances hes been pretty dominating in every game and i love how he challenges hitters he might be the only one in the league without a streak of poor performances hes an incredible young man so poised for his age and his upbeat and relaxed attitude is a real positive
9229703 strikeouts and era are in your control wins and reaching the playoffs are not
9229704 for timmy to be a strong candidate hes got to win 18 or 19 but itll be tough if webb keeps winning
9229705 the thing with timmy he just wants to go pitch he enjoys pitching everything else is a bonus
9229706 its great to hear a cy young winner say ive got a chance
9229707 its a compliment to hear from him i could be one of those guys but im not thinking about winning a cy young award today tomorrow or the next day
9229708 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9229709 our focus is really on this side of the river
9229710 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9229711 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9229712 i feel as one person who stands up i have a voice and letting it be heard sends fear to the establishment
9229713 were facing what could be a very strong hurricane possibly one of the largest and strongest to hit america since records began
9229714 we have gone from a reactive organization to a proactive organization
9229715 theres no reason for anyone to stay in new orleans to ride out this storm
9229716 we cant stop the damage from happening what we can do is move people out of harms way
9229717 no its a private matter and you should delete this diary
9229718 yes the future of the world is at stake really nothings off the table
9229719 most of the time we have an audible call to kellen where he can run the ball himself
9229720 thats the best part about being in the 2 minute because all of the audibles are based on the defense so we can really take advantage
9229721 i actually didnt know i was that close to the record
9229722 western kentucky did a really good job controlling the tempo particularly in the third quarter
9229723 the field position changed and that was partly our fault partly theirs
9229724 were in great shape especially the offensive line it got to a point in the game right there in the first half that the defensive lineman werent even getting their hands down for a pass rush
9229725 in case of war redzikowo and slupsk will be more secure than other places and not less secure
9229726 os gols que estamos tomando s o de total desaten o nossa mesmo geral

9229740 mostramos com essa vota o que a situa o est certa que o clube est no caminho certo mas isso ser bom para os dois lados
9229741 we want to bring faith to people to see that miracles do happen and that prayer does work
9229742 its like in the bible where jesus performed miracles to bring faith to the people maybe this is gods plan for some of this
9229743 i know he can do it especially now that i see how determined he really is we just need to keep praying god will heal him
9229744 they were getting 100 calls a day at the icu they wanted me to do this
9229745 and i know there are probably a lot of you worried that andrew or drew or langley or big dog or whatever your favorite name for him is has changed i dont want you to be too worried hes still a jokester and hes still full of life
9229746 we know there are a lot of people reading in england
9229747 one day i didnt post and people everywhere just panicked they couldnt stand it they thought something was wrong
9229748 when i first starting doing it he was quite sedated later when he was conscious more he would ask me not to say certain things because he didnt want people to worry it was an adjustment for him and his private nature but then he started to see how many people were posting comments he couldnt believe how many people were reading and wanting to know about him
9229749 we have perfected our more advanced method for communication called the alphabet game he spells words by having me go through the alphabet and i stop on whichever letter he blinks on its pretty effective and not as time consuming as you might think
9229750 although we have a new normal we are so thankful to have one another and we cherish our time together
9229751 please pray for andrew to have the strength and the focus to begin to move his thumbs
9229752 she said if that cant happen what is your next goal
9229753 we have had a miracle happen while we were here
9229754 the doctors were amazed they said this just doesnt happen there is no explanation for it a respiratory therapist said shed only seen it happen once before
9229755 during the times he was awake i was able to read him all of the posts to the blog and he was happy to hear from all of you i could see from his expressions that he was touched
9229756 we are very blessed we have had a lot of help back in yuma
9229757 they dont call it permanent paralysis until two years post injury
9229758 you can still gain movement for up to two years it doesnt mean you will but it doesnt mean you wont either
9229759 andrew and i resumed our study of the healing scriptures today
9229760 for it is god who works in you both to will and to do for his good pleasure
9229761 watchoo doing woman i dont believe youre eating his food dont you read about mythology dont you know you cant do such gosh
9229762 this is really starting to open up i think were headed for real disclosure and some serious organisations are moving in that direction
9229763 nasa does not track ufos nasa is not involved in any sort of cover up about alien life on this planet or anywhere in the universe
9229764 i was saying to myself i just might be writing my career off right now
9229765 that was the same way last year the same way the year before
9229766 i have no reason for this year saying i was retiring as opposed to the last two years nothing had changed in march the previous two years i felt the same way it could have gone either way
9229767 he told me hed like to have something before free agency and obviously before the draft and i said it makes sense but im not ready
9229768 i said right now i could care less about football
9229769 you go and ask every one of those guys who have played 10 years or longer when do they start to think about playing football again
9229770 the day i told mccarthy i was going to retire he said are you sure
9229771 no im not sure but you want an answer so im giving you an answer
9229772 i told him that and said who knows i may change my mind
9229773 i dont know the day but i woke up and said hell yeah its worth it
9229774 if you were a betting man and you said ok who gives us the best chance to win right now
9229775 this is not bragging but i would think i would aaron might play great and then they all look like geniuses but to not welcome me back and im just assuming for fear of upsetting aaron not only now but in the future is totally ridiculous totally ridiculous
9229776 the bottom line was i wanted to play and i felt like this team had a good chance to win
9229777 i said mike let me give you the best year i can possibly give you and lets go from there to sit here and even think about next year with whats in front of us right now is way premature

9229800 nikolai hat das zeug alle titel zu vereinigen jeder will gegen ihn boxen er ist ein ph nomen die menschen lieben ihn
9229801 but no by your lord they can have no faith until they make you judge in all disputed matters between them and find in themselves no resistance against your decision and accept them with full submission
9229802 i leave you with two things as long as you hold them tightly you never go astray they are the book of allah and my sunnah
9229803 weve been doing more of that since the florida hurricanes the year before katrina
9229804 when i first was diagnosed i cried for a bit
9229805 its beyond scary to be told that this is going to happen and especially at my age
9229806 no one at 25 years old is supposed to get this let alone someone who has been relatively healthy her whole life its a tough thing for anyone to take in patient family friends but i couldnt ask for better ones
9229807 i remember that we all went out to dinner that night with my best friend and had a fabulous italian dinner with great italian wine
9229808 we got in touch with the right people and had the best doctors to ask questions to
9229809 i never realized what a relief it is as the person going through it to have so many people that you can rely on
9229810 i honestly dont know what id do without the love and support of my family and friends
9229811 i am also trying not to indulge in that extra glass of wine other than that just staying as healthy and positive as possible
9229812 we moeten voor de kerst beter spelen en meer punten pakken dan vorig seizoen dan komt het goed met ons
9229813 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9229814 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9229815 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9229816 but they both had the same content content that showed me the results of all this years grands prix but nothing else
9229817 whether listeria was the actual cause or the underlying cause is very difficult to determine
9229818 many of our recalls relate to products such as sandwiches and pre packaged meats meats carrying best before dates that have now already expired
9229819 nevertheless in the public interest and in the interest of openness we feel it is important that such info is visible
9229820 we went on a weeknight so it wasnt crowded and the service was good
9229821 while on a mission to gather some meat for a little bbq without the hassle of having to drive somewhere my friend and i stumbled into la
9229822 oooo we have plenty of open seats in the main area why dont you i just take you to a table
9229823 would you like anything in your quesadilla besides just cheese chicken or beef maybe
9229824 let me get this straight last night you stayed in a hotel by yourself you went hiking today by yourself you went to the movies by yourself and now you want to subject your quesadilla to only be with cheese
9229825 what am i supposed to do about it do you see 1 800 complain anywhere on my shirt
9229826 bay watch formerly first watch is one of my favorite breakfast places
9229827 its your birthday next weekend ill go wherever you want for lunch
9229828 the government has closed this border in order to cut off the rebellion of laurent nkunda from its supply source
9229829 we want to stop nkunda from being able to supply himself to continue this war
9229830 weve established ourselves as a party that cannot be described as fringe
9229831 as prime minister i told harper i would have been convening the leaders to figure out how we work on these key issues
9229832 i got no sense the prime minister is prepared to do what i would do if i were prime minister
9229833 with a green mp sitting in the house of commons it will now be impossible to exclude the green party from the televised leaders debates in the next election
9229834 our view is there should only be one liberal candidate in the leaders debate
9229835 you cant have two candidates from essentially the same party in the debate
9229836 cant bring in a ringer to boost him during the debate
9229837 i like to think canadians notice when someone breaks their word in such spectacular fashion
9229838 something spooked him and he changed his mind its contemptible
9229839 fire dancing circuses and 3 000 person light saber war
9229840 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9229841 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9229842 i dont think the hurricane will break them but i dont want someone breaking in
9229843 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9229844 i dont know why it is we are in such a hurry to get up when we fall down you might think we would lie there and rest for a while
9229845 what in the world am i doing running im 46 years old ill hurt myself im not strong enough to run no more exercising its too much i cant handle it
9229846 the existing phrasebooks are inadequate they are well enough as far as they go but when you fall down and skin your leg they dont tell you what to say
9229847 we would be more alive if we did more of this
9229848 life would be more lovely if we did less of that
9229849 failure is not the falling down but the staying down

9229898 it definitely makes it difficult because you cant help but love sarah palin
9229899 43 years ago palin couldnt walk or talk or use the potty by herself
9229900 not the whip not the whip anything but the whip
9229901 but if we allow our party to be taken over by raving misogynist twits with their hands on the levers theres a good chance that hillary will be crowned

9229965 our aim is for every single school to welcome children from all backgrounds it is a simple goal strongly supported by the public educationalists and students
9229966 there are those who attend church in order that their children qualify for admission to a particular school and never set foot in the church again after the children have been accepted
9229967 all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9229968 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9229969 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children the bottom line is that faith schools are successful thriving popular and here to stay
