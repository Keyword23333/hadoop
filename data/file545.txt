5450007 for us this meeting is not as amicable as it might seem
5450008 a game against england at wembley has a lot importance and we are thoroughly prepared to offer a good show
5450009 the euros are forgotten and what matters now is to prepare in the best possible way for the qualifying rounds for world cup 2010 playing against england will help this
5450010 i am motivated by this meeting a clash at wembley will raise morale and hopefully we can perform well and win this wednesday
5450011 the czech republic is undergoing a renovation after the euros but we have quality players to be at the top of europe now our dream is a place at the world cup 2010
5450012 the england team was not at the euros but that does not detract from the fact they have great figures to me it was a big surprise they did not qualify
5450013 david beckham has enough quality to continue to lead them being in front of people like beckham lampard terry rooney and gerrard will bring the best out of us
5450014 if the fight was important enough i think i could just get down to 12 stone 7lbs
5450015 but if a big fight was presented to me like a chad dawson even the winner of kelly pavlik or bernard hopkins and there was enough money on the table yes i might take the chance
5450016 i might take the risk but at the moment i am a cruiserweight and i want to clean up the cruiserweights
5450017 but never say never if i get a big offer and something meaningful on the table id definitely think about it
5450018 im fit im strong and ive got a lot of people to prove wrong at the moment
5450019 i feel like a dangerous man i was meant to fight on july 19 that didnt happen but im ready to go
5450020 i saw banks last fight and thought he was pretty useless to be honest but look at my last fight and i was pretty useless myself

5450041 you see i did that lexis nexis search and the funny thing is that you can doctor your results depending on your search criteria
5450042 sean hannity is that the best you got really sure fox news is conservative but they are the only ones do you bother to watch cnn or cbs nightly news or any and i mean any of the other ones how about keith obermanns constant bashing of mccain on msnbc or are you just once again being selective in what you choose to bring up or not bring up seems like the case to me
5450043 onto the elitist issue tell me where did mccain ever belittle individuals for all to hear like obama did when he refered to small town america
5450044 and you sort of forget that obama is not poor either he sure has nice suits and expensive shoes so according to your reasoning everyone in d c is an elistist because they dress well
5450045 of course i never made any claim in my original post that mccain was or was not an elistist only pointing out something obama said which clearly is elitist
5450046 but of course it is a very popular tactic to try to spin accusations back on someone else and not addressing the issue about themselves
5450047 and mccain being another bush you know that is another headline i saw when i did my lexis nexis search on the candidates guess you forgot to mention that one in your original post probably where you got your talking points from and well on that issue you had better do your homework there because there are differences between mccain and bush like stem cell research for one
5450048 but of course you like so many other obama supporters probably revolve around the iraq issue of course no one seems to complain that we have had troops stationed in germany and japan for 60 years now and south korea for 50 years
5450049 but the obama fans want the troops out of iraq right now because soldiers are getting killed
5450050 people it is a war and that is what happens in a war the troop casualties from iraq do not come anywhere near the level that they were in vietnam so dont compare iraq to vietnam because they are not the same

5450124 i am but i try and word it in a different way
5450125 im not happy that it happened but i dont think my life would have changed any other way
5450126 i didnt think id end up where i am now i didnt think id end up like my father
5450127 i used to run off at the mouth and be so filled with emotions
5450128 i had to look into myself it was easier to blame other people or not admit that i had a problem

5450193 it was a very good evening for mccain and not so good for obama
5450194 absent any other explanation one has to assume that mccain is in close contact with the grim reaper himself it makes me wonder what mccain knows of the plans that pestilence and famine have for america between now and the year 2013 naturally you can pretty much assume that mccain is following war on twitter

5450216 i can talk to patients about medicinal cannabis and im often recommending it to them for these indications
5450217 its like other pain medicines you have to keep taking it
5450218 criminalizing use of that plant by people who are ill when you are making its main psychoactive ingredient legal in the form of a very expensive pill
5450219 the fda has ruled that marijuana has no medical benefits but its harms are well known and proven
5450220 there are more teens in drug treatment for marijuana dependence than for alcohol or any other drug
5450221 except for the harms associated with smoking the adverse effects of marijuana use are within the range of effects tolerated for other medications
5450222 so 95 of the people are not going to get psychotic even if they smoke on a daily basis
5450223 the main limitations of these studies is that you can never be sure that its the cannabis itself thats causing this risk
5450224 the evidence is probably strong enough that people should be aware of this risk
5450225 the data are variable to be sure but most studies have found that over the years the rate of schizophrenia has been stable or even declining
5450226 theres also a modest decrease in iq if teens use heavily though weekly users and folks who quit dont seem to show it
5450227 i began with the hypothesis that regular smoking of marijuana would have an impact on the lungs qualitatively similar to the impact of regular tobacco smoking
5450228 this is amazing because the marijuana smokers average three joints a day but the tobacco controls smoked 22 cigarettes suggesting that on a cigarette to cigarette basis marijuana may be more damaging

5450230 their main goal is to find permanent safe placement for the child
5450231 these cases are actually appointed by a judge these kids are already in the system usually for dependency and neglect
5450232 its the judges decision on where the child is placed but they are trained to have the best interests of the child in mind while they are doing their investigation
5450233 we can only represent only about 12 percent of the cases that come in but 12 percent is better than zero percent
5450234 there is overwhelming support for casa from judges attorneys child welfare workers
5450235 and parents have said that with the casa volunteer it does make a difference in the lives of children in how they are served and the placement is quicker
5450236 child abuse and neglect can be found in every community even the
5450237 its growing rapidly but its a delicate balance still in the growth phase
5450238 i think once you get the education out there its going to take off and do very well because its a very healthy plant very versatile plant it can be used for just about anything
5450239 were not here for a party were here to communicate the significance of this as a crop
5450240 just about all the carmakers are using some kind of a natural fibre technology it just makes economic sense
5450241 and now with oil being expensive the idea of using plant based products to replace oil based products just makes a whole lot of economic sense
5450242 the fibre is useful its a healthy plan good for you and everything why hasnt it taken off
5450243 actually i burned it in a big open area when no one was around
5450244 in retrospect growing the crop is the easy thing taking it all the way to market theres challenges involved when we got going there was no processing infrastructure and not a lot was understood about the markets
5450245 people dont appreciate what has to be done in the development of the infrastructure
5450246 change is just a matter of time time is what it takes to allow for change to occur our country needs a change
5450247 the competition is designed to encourage an interest in cooking at an early age

5450254 it is better to fight the iraqi army today than they fights tomorrow
5450255 conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth
5450256 it is better to fight the iraqi army today than they fights tomorrow

5450266 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama

5450270 after waiting for 10 years my disability was raised from 30 percent to 80 percent
5450271 all too often it gets bounced around and no final decision is made
5450272 with the va having trouble handling disability claims from previous generations of wartime veterans this new generation may be in for a long and bumpy ride
5450273 and unfortunately there are a number of veterans who have died before their claims are finally resolved
5450274 i heard clearly the dissatisfaction with veterans waiting excessive periods of time to have their claims adjudicated
5450275 a veteran should not need a lawyer to figure what benefit is due or to get that benefit
5450276 they told me i had a new right knee and many of the issues involving the knee were now resolved but i had a metal prosthesis in my leg and there were new issues i appealed my reduced disability rating and it took five years to resolve i finally went to rep brian higgins and within a week it was settled in my favor

5450281 you were the last hope of innocent people and your bravery saved lives
5450282 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5450283 what georgian authorities have done is beyond human understanding it cannot be understood and left unpunished
5450284 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
5450285 if someone thinks that our citizens can be killed soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers killed with impunity we will never permit that
5450286 anyone who tries anything like that will face a crushing response
5450287 we have the strength and wherewithal for this economic political and military

5450292 the age of consent is 18 years where the sexual activity involves exploitative activity such as prostitution pornography or where there is a relationship of trust authority or dependency for other sexual activity the age of consent is 14

5450305 weve had time in the past i think were all going on six years together now reading body language coming out of routes is big for me and i think seeing them run those routes for six years has spoken for itself

5450319 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5450320 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5450321 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5450322 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5450323 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5450324 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5450325 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5450326 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5450327 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5450328 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5450329 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5450330 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5450331 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5450332 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5450333 theres just not enough people to work in the restaurants the pay is so much better
5450334 prices keep going up because they know they can get it

5450339 so youll see a difference in vocals a little bit more personality and its definitely a sensual album
5450340 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5450341 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5450342 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it
5450343 i didnt want something so vague and so clubby because i wanted people to see me as a woman with something to say
5450344 i would say that an official girl is someone in a relationship
5450345 youre attentive youre honest but at the same time you can let go a little bit

5450350 nearly all of world population growth is now concentrated in the worlds poorer countries
5450351 and by 2050 global population is projected to rise to 9 3 billion between now and mid century these diverging growth patterns will boost the population share living in todays less developed countries from 82 percent to 86 percent
5450352 the idea came up when i was about eight months pregnant when i was beached like a whale i was watching tv and i saw a triathlon and i said i think i could do that that would be great for me to do maybe i could do that this year and of course everybody told me i was crazy
5450353 today more than three quarters of those radio airwaves or white space spectrum are completely unused
5450354 this vast public resource could offer a revolution in wireless services of all kinds including universal wireless internet
5450355 this is a huge opportunity to get connectivity to the american people particularly in rural areas i think it will make a huge difference to everybody
5450356 these devices could knock out wireless communications systems like headsets used by coaches and officials microphones used by referees to announce penalties and calls and microphones used by journalists to conduct interviews with athletes and coaches
5450357 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research

5450361 i turned to my dad and said dad we got the same score he looked up and said oh yeah we started getting a little confused
5450362 its not correct i believe its correct to have two gold medals
5450363 but this is my modest opinion the ioc is different
5450364 im not sure if anybody understands what the hell is going on
5450365 it wasnt like i got second by three tenths or five tenths i had the same score thats what makes it a little harder to take
5450366 in other sports like track and field its all timed and it doesnt have anything to do with judging you do your routine and you turn it over to the judges thats what weve been going through our entire lives and weve come to accept it
5450367 shes an excellent athlete no matter how old she is
5450368 shes done her hard work and her preparation she definitely deserved her gold medal
5450369 i play by the rules so in my opinion i have to say yes
5450370 judges have their own opinion and once you land your dismount theres nothing else you can do
5450371 i have the most important medal and its the all around gold
5450372 i have four medals now and im tied with my dad one gold two silvers and a bronze and i have one more chance to get one gold that i feel like i missed out on today
5450373 overall as a group its an area we can get better at
5450374 this is a chance for young guys to show what they can do
5450375 any opportunity in the big leagues is an opportunity to grab a job thats the bottom line
5450376 so youll see a difference in vocals a little bit more personality and its definitely a sensual album
5450377 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5450378 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5450379 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it
5450380 i didnt want something so vague and so clubby because i wanted people to see me as a woman with something to say
5450381 i would say that an official girl is someone in a relationship
5450382 youre attentive youre honest but at the same time you can let go a little bit

5450462 we are seeing evidence of ss 21 missiles in south ossetia
5450463 but let me be clear if it rolled in after august 6th it needs to roll out
5450464 that would be in keeping with the russian commitment on withdrawal
5450465 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the ceasefire and should be removed immediately
5450466 the only forces that are permitted to remain under the ceasefire agreement are the forces that were in there at the august 6th timeframe
5450467 were seeing them solidify their positions in south ossetia and abkhazia
5450468 i cant say whether they are actually moving people out right now or not but we do expect them to start moving out we expect them to move out slowly so this may take some time

5450471 the key to a mans heart is through his stomach
5450472 t minus five hours until i host both reverse cowgirl and debauchette
5450473 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
5450474 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
5450475 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
5450476 well sir according to the evidence this massacre could only have been caused by ninjas
5450477 its nothing i can control and honestly i can say it has been very fair to me and i got the biggest gold medal of them all

5450480 cambios profundos que saquen al pa s de este inmovilismo econ mico y estimulen a la gente que acaben con esta tragedia que tenemos de que para progresar la gente tenga que marcharse o vivir del invento dentro de la isla porque con su trabajo no puede
5450481 la gente se cre una expectativa superior a las cosas que han ocurrido realmente
5450482 algunas restricciones que eran demasiado absurdas no significa nada si se tiene en cuenta lo que el pa s necesita y deber a suceder

5450485 the whole competition has been clean honest and transparent and fully reflects the new aiba reform
5450486 the ioc president dr jacques rogge has said that aiba has done an excellent job all the noc presidents and secretary generals who have come to watch boxing have all been impressed and this must continue the new disciplinary commission and code of conduct for all officials and staff are two key initiatives which have been integral in improving the performance across all areas of boxing we must maintain the highest level of judging and retain these excellent standards
5450487 we congratulate both parties on an excellent presentation and candidature file
5450488 they were both extremely professional and the entire executive committee was suitably impressed we now have taken a significant step in a project which will lift the standards across all areas of boxing
5450489 it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
5450490 my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders

5450493 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will
5450494 this discovery may eventually lead to enhanced understanding of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder all conditions in which a persons ability to remember and change such rules is impaired
5450495 this indicates that different parts of our brains store different kinds of memories and information
5450496 provides clues about how the human brain accomplishes complex goal directed behaviors that require remembering and changing abstract rules an ability that is disrupted in many mental illnesses
5450497 the problem of age bias raised in this study may negate efforts to improve clinical care for elderly trauma patients within trauma centers if the system as a whole does not function properly and deliver patients appropriately to needed resources
5450498 survey results suggest that lack of training related to elderly trauma patients and unfamiliarity with protocol may be allowing unconscious bias to affect triage decisions and that this problem occurs among both ems providers and medical personnel at the receiving trauma centers
5450499 elderly patients are undertriaged in maryland because rural hospitals are excluded from the states trauma system
5450500 trauma surgeons must advocate for the inclusion of seriously injured elderly patients in statewide trauma systems but should also recognize that optimal care may be determined by the elderly patients unique priorities and preferences
5450501 undertriage of elderly trauma patients to state designated trauma centers
5450502 before i can live with other folks ive got to live with myself the one thing that doesnt abide by majority rule is a persons conscience

5450522 a carico dello straniero prosegue la nota pendeva un mandato di arresto ai fini estradizionali verso il marocco per i reati di terrorismo
5450523 una grande ingiustizia essere giudicato in un tribunale poi assolto poi essere estradato cos veramente nessuna legge pu giustificare questo
5450524 io non posso perch la mia religione non tollerer queste cose assolutamente
5450525 laccusa nei confronti di zergout stata fabbricata ad hoc nei confronti di un innocente che da dieci anni non mette piede in marocco
5450526 questo il modo di operare di un paese il marocco che agisce fuori da ogni controllo proprio di uno stato di diritto
5450527 di lasciare i miei figli senza che nessuno si prenda cura di loro soprattutto senza aver commesso o fatto qualcosa che merita questo

5450538 i russi ha detto bush dal ranch di crawford hanno affermato che il ritiro sarebbe cominciato entro mezzogiorno di oggi continueremo a monitorare le operazioni militari russe per averne conferma tutto questo deve avvenire senza rinvii
5450539 oggi in accordo con il piano di pace il ritiro dei peacekeeper russi e dei rinforzi ha avuto inizio
5450540 al contrario di quanto afferma lo stato maggiore di mosca le truppe russe non si stanno ritirando dal nostro territorio
5450541 non si vede alcun ritiro di truppe russe anzi chiarisce decine di posti di blocco sono stati istituiti dai russi sulla rotta kachuri igoieti
5450542 vorrei distinguere i due termini c una distinzione tra ritirare le truppe e farle ripiegare nella conversazione telefonica tra il presidente russo dmitri medvedev e il presidente francese nicolas sarkozy hanno parlato solo di un ripiegamento e io spero che questa sottile distinzione sia percepita non si sta parlando di una ritirata

5450551 were not going to comment on speculation as the secretary has said many times we have no intentions of using this authority
5450552 murderous terrorists are freed so why wont they free yigal and hagai amir
5450553 i dont see a problem with a film like this that has the goal of preserving democracy and balance if samir kuntar goes home there is no reason why yigal amir should rot in jail
5450554 the leftists need to understand that democracy means real and full equality i personally think that kuntars crime is many times more severe than amirs for the sake of justice and fairness there is no reason that amir and other national prisoners should stay in prison when israel gives goodwill gestures to killers
5450555 this is a gesture and a trust building move aimed at bolstering the moderates in the palestinian authority and the peace process

5450582 we teach kids to be less focused on themselves and more on the community
5450583 they spend a couple hours each week on the project the kids are learning leadership skills
5450584 we decided to exist to equip kids to think live and bring about change in a culture that says kids are going backward not forward
5450585 in doing my masters thesis i found that what makes a difference in a kids life is an adult whos truly involved we are deeply involved in their lives in discipling and mentoring them
5450586 we wanted to form a school where kate would both know others and be known in deeper life changing ways and be challenged in every part of her life
5450587 three teachers with 12 kids is a great ratio its challenging academically but also personally and spiritually its not for every kid
5450588 were preparing them for college in intense ways and theres also a decidedly spiritual component its the education you dream about for your kid a partnering of school with the home
5450589 they taught the kids how to fundraise how to write a fundraising letter how to make a call how to run an event make a budget and develop a profit and loss statement
5450590 they were an energetic group very focused on what they were doing
5450591 we had a conversation with nancy parsons and rosemary moore and talked about how the project would fit the needs of the council we came up with the baby bag project it was a wonderful experience for the council and the kids from veritas they got an up close look at the workings of a nonprofit
5450592 its wonderful for the council to have an opportunity to expose future leaders to community service and citizenship
5450593 it teaches them as kids to support those kinds of community activities
5450594 the tuition is 4 200 per year but well work with parents and kids if they cant afford that
5450595 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
5450596 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation

5450598 one of the greatest freedoms we have here in america is the freedom of speech even the freedom to protest this meeting thats a good thing but we have to learn how to have civility in our civilization how to stop being rude how to stop demonizing each other and how to have a discussion and a debate because we all want america to be a greater place
5450599 in the last week two major pillars of president bushs approach to foreign policy have crumbled jeopardizing eight years of work and sending the administration scrambling for new strategies in the waning months of its term
5450600 from the earliest days of his presidency bush had said spreading democracy was a centerpiece of his foreign policy
5450601 and in pursuing both these major goals bush relied heavily on developing what he saw as strong personal relationships with foreign leaders

5450620 yeah you spend more on your mac so you look good in a coffee shop

5450628 military sources confirm russia to start war against georgia this summer
5450629 putins circle has already adopted a decision to launch a war with georgia in august
5450630 an armed conflict may get started first just as a clash and then uncontrollable escalation will begin and it will develop into a war
5450631 the war will engulf not only abkhazia but south ossetia and the north caucasus as well abkhazian president sergei bagapsh and many in georgia have told me that the conflict in abkhazia will virtually inevitably engulf the north caucasus also
5450632 expert felgenhauer is a qualified specialist so it would be wrong to ignore his warnings
5450633 still it must be mentioned that from political standpoint this particular solution will be detrimental to russia first of all
5450634 georgias plans to solve the conflict around abkhazia by force are fraught with emerging danger of a new large scale military conflict
5450635 got concerned with the information voiced at the press conference in sukhumi on july 5th which shows that georgian capital tbilisi is now inclined to solve the georgian abkhaz conflict by force
5450636 special attention for example should be paid to the documentary materials that reveal the intentions of the georgian side to
5450637 such plans nurtured by tbilisi may be regarded as nothing but another step aimed at the escalation of tensions in the region which is fraught with developing of conflicts into a new war
5450638 in these conditions the leadership of defense ministry of the russian federation is stating with full responsibility that russian peacekeeping contingent operating in the zone of the georgian abkhaz conflict will keep on carrying out its mission in compliance with the mandate entrusted and will be doing all it can to avoid bloodshed

5450699 brazilian midfielder fred scored on a 27th minute header as united 9 9 1 atoned for last sundays 4 1 loss at new york earned its second shutout in three league matches and snapped a seven game unbeaten streak by the fire 9 6 5
5450700 one goal proved to be enough as united held on for the win thanks in no small part to the play of crayton the liberian international signed with the team friday and started his first mls game saturday in his debut crayton collected a win a shutout and made two saves
5450701 mcbride went to work immediately after entering he won headers at midfield and in the penalty box and narrowly missed out on an assist when andy herron drifted a shot over the crossbar in the 48th minute
5450702 the two big talking points will be louis craytons outstanding if understated performance and the officiating
5450703 clyde simms would be nice if he stopped giving the ball away sometimes though
5450704 there was a shifting of the gears that seemed to take place in my head during this match rather than dreading the inevitable moment of madness from the united defense that would lead to chicago sticking one in the net i was expecting a big play from blanco or mcbride to do the dirty deed thats a massive psychological shift when you worry about the other team having to do something rather than your own defense tossing up the mandatory brain fart
5450705 as for crayton he did a good job there were several times when i was like oh crap but about half of those he was fine it was mostly my leftover zach wells angst coming through crayton made me worry a few times aside from the wells related things but he never really let us down i expect if he can keep this up that once he gets to know our back line hell do better i mean he cant be worse than wells at this point and if nothing else he kept a clean sheet our second of the season
5450706 id like to say this was one of the worst mls officiating performances ive ever seen but ive seen too many mls games
5450707 what has happened to my fandom have i lost the faith

5450885 plutonic feeling it prudent to have the best bid possible felt it would make sense to bring in a financial partner to backstop our bid to show the utility that we have the financial wherewithal to undertake the projects
5450886 plutonic enters the call with not only a solid hydro resource but with a clear financial deal that will allow it to understand in a very detailed way what it must bid to make its threshold economics
5450887 as a result their bids will be deemed much lower risk than any other potential projects by bc hydro in effect this should lead to a much lower discount rate to be applied to these projects
5450888 we think given our proximity to vancouver that we will be extremely competitive in the call for tender

5450916 its one of these cases that does go right to the heart of the procurement process
5450917 we maintain that our work for the nrc was free of even the potential for a conflict of interest
5450918 our work for other customers was entirely independent of the possible nrc standards at issue in the case as it was performed in support of the department of energy a federal department that is autonomous self regulating and separate from the nrc

5450922 saic was interested in pursuing the billions of dollars worth of business that would result from doe and other commercial nuclear facilities performing decontamination and decommissioning of their facilities
5450923 saic did not disclose this as an organizational conflict of interest relationship
5450924 if saic has an oci relationship to disclose it is not enough to simply bury it in the text of a technical proposal if there is an oci relationship it is not nrcs obligation to find it

5450928 it was approximately two miles from the runway we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft
5450929 we noticed it was flying low and literally within a split second we saw a light aircraft come in from the right
5450930 the twin engined aircraft struck the light aircraft and just totally destroyed it
5450931 such a show of violence is pushing kashmiri people especially our youth toward revolution
5450932 at this point i think the international community has to step in otherwise we fear a growing extremism this kind of anger comes at the worst time
5450933 pakistan has to put its political house in order before we can say what it means for kashmir
5450934 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5450935 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5450936 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5450937 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5450938 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5450939 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5450940 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5450941 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5450942 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5450943 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama
5450944 dat er nu ook wel een einde zal komen aan zijn anonimiteit

5450948 we are taking military action to stop these atrocities perpetrated by the milf
5450949 clear manifestation of the insincerity to the peace process of a significant portion of the milf
5450950 we would probably wait and see what ukraines response is what the eu u s and natos response is then we would try to draw up a new balance sheet which takes these things into consideration

5450971 teuerung ist kein schicksal f r sozial und umweltorganisationen ist der konsequente kurs auf die energieunabh ngigkeit sterreichs eine klare koalitionsbedingung
5450972 jetzt schon k nnen es sich 313 000 menschen in sterreich also vier prozent der wohnbev lkerung nicht leisten die wohnung angemessen warm zu halten
5450973 wenn nichts passiert wird diese zahl n chstes jahr auf eine halbe million anwachsen
5450974 einkommensschwache sitzen in der energiearmutsfalle da das untere einkommensf nftel kein kapital hat um notwendige investitionen zu t tigen
5450975 sterreich muss bis 2040 den v lligen ausstieg aus fossilen brennstoffen erreichen
5450976 ein land mit derartig guten voraussetzungen wie sterreich stichwort wasserkraft sollte sich aber deutlich mehr vornehmen um als den gesamtprozess positiv zu beeinflussen und industriepolitische impulse zu setzen als zwischenziel muss entsprechend der vorgaben des weltklimarates der co2 aussto bis 2020 um 40 prozent gemessen am niveau von 1990 verringert werden noch in der n chsten legislaturperiode m ssen die kyoto verpflichtungen bis 2012 durch berwiegend inl ndische ma nahmen erreicht werden das hei t der co2 aussto sterreichs muss sich gemessen am aktuellen stand um rund 30 prozent verringern
5450977 das ist der richtige weg den die gr nen vehement vertreten diese ist nicht nur der schl ssel im klimaschutz sondern auch ein zentrales sozial und wirtschaftspolitisches projekt
5450978 der steigende lpreis ist einer der hauptgr nde f r die teuerung die immer mehr menschen in die armut treibt ohne gegenma nahmen k nnen sich n chstes jahr eine halbe million menschen keine warme wohnung mehr leisten wenn nicht rasch gehandelt wird dieser erschreckende befund von armutskonferenz und greenpeace erfordert umgehende gegenma nahmen
5450979 ein energieunabh ngiges sterreich bietet auch gro e wirtschaftliche chancen statt weiterhin viele milliarden euro f r l und gasimporte aus geopolitisch instabilen und demokratisch zweifelhaften regionen zu importieren wird dieses geld in sterreich in neue technologien investiert und schafft zehntausende neue arbeitspl tze
5450980 die energiewende ist f r die gr nen ein zentrales und unumst liches projekt auch nach der wahl
5450981 die fp verweist seit langem darauf dass die hohen und weiter steigenden energiepreise vor allem die bezieher niedriger einkommen vor gr te probleme stellen auch zu sparen oder der umstieg auf erneuerbare energietr ger ist f r diese bev lkerungsgruppe besonders schwierig
5450982 man muss nat rlich geld in die hand nehmen um den altbau und altwohnungsbestand ad quat zu sanieren
5450983 zum anderen ist damit eine markante senkung der heizkosten zu gew hrleisten
5450984 wir haben in unseren antr gen alle f r die umsetzung dieses ansinnens relevanten parameter aufgelistet die von der beschleunigten einf hrung des geb udeenergieausweises ber adaptionen der landes bauordnungen und die schaffung eines tragf higen erneuerbare energien gesetzes ein verbot von l und erdgasdirektheizungen in neubauten und den verpflichtenden einbau von solaranlagen in mehrgeschossigen wohnh usern bis hin zu fachlich fundierter energieberatung reichen um den notleidenden menschen die sich das heizen nicht mehr leisten k nnen zu helfen muss in sterreich vor allem und das ist ziel unseres hauptantrages im parlament eine thermische sanierungsoffensive f r den althaus und altwohnungsbestand durchgef hrt werden
5450985 diese 800 millionen euro direktzuschuss j hrlich sollen einen beitrag leisten um zu einer raschen sanierung des althausbestandes zu kommen denn soziales wohnen hei t in zukunft nicht mehr dass man billig zu einer wohnung kommt sondern dass man sich die betriebskosten leisten kann

5451016 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5451017 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5451018 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5451019 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5451020 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5451021 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5451022 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5451023 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5451024 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5451025 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5451026 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5451027 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5451028 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children

5451033 barack obama on the issue of life is further left than anybody in the congress of the united states he not only pro abortion but pro abortion on demand he is pro late term abortion pro partial birth abortion he objected to the supreme court ruling that upheld the ban
5451034 but most important barack obama and the illinois legislature supported or rather opposed a bill that would have protected the life of babies born from a botched abortion who were alive three times and i do know republicans are planning or rather 527s are planning attack ads on this and i will be interested to see if rick warren brings it up

5451062 for women over 40 receiving a mammogram should be equal across income education racial and geographical levels
5451063 our study discovered rural african american and native american women were less likely to receive the screening
5451064 the results indicate a greater need to educate women particularly with culturally sensitive messages about the importance of these screenings
5451065 it also is imperative that we work with health professionals to provide culturally competent care
5451066 the results indicate a greater need to educate women particularly with culturally sensitive messages about the importance of these screenings
5451067 this program has had a tremendous impact on the lives of women
5451068 of course we can always do more to educate women on the importance of these screenings we continue to evaluate the program looking for ways to serve women better

5451073 reducing the psychosocial impact of acne is considered one of the guiding principles for its clinical management and it is important to measure and evaluate this impact
5451074 knowledge of these patient preferences may help dermatologists balance clinical trial results with patients expectations of therapy
5451075 randomized blinded placebo controlled clinical trials have shown that three to four months of conventional acne therapy including topical benzoyl peroxide topical retinoids and oral antibiotics typically produces reductions in lesion counts in the 40 percent to 60 percent range
5451076 it has also been suggested that the incidence of scarring from facial acne approaches 95 percent thus adolescents marked preference for total clearance over partial 50 percent clearance or clearance with scarring suggests that physicians must weigh high patient expectations against these clinical data
5451077 the hope is so high that it will have some effect that everybodys asking for it
5451078 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
5451079 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5451080 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant

5451089 in conclusion we feel that the evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of stay
5451090 the potential benefits to individual patients in health economics terms are such that a well designed large scale blinded randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm is warranted to answer the question of whether gum chewing can significantly reduce the length of stay after abdominal surgery or whether it merely represents a placebo effect

5451104 como persona soy el mismo me han inculcado los valores de can bar a y tengo la misma educaci n de siempre en cambio como futbolista he ido evolucionando y madurando entiendo mucho m s el juego en qu momento has hacer una pausa en el juego qu necesita el equipo y hablo mucho m s en el campo
5451105 estoy muy contento de haber superado a todos estos mitos del barcelonismo y todav a me quedan un par por superar migueli y reixach porque todav a
5451106 el hecho que de pep estuviera lesionado y que yo debiera ocupar su posici n en aquel momento cuando l era un s mbolo de la culerada fue un reto incre ble
5451107 yo s lo ten a 18 a os y asumir el rol que ten a pep en aquel equipo fue muy dif cil pero todo el mundo me apoy mucho y van gaal confi plenamente en m adem s recuerdo mucho el apoyo de pep a n cuando l estaba lesionado y en su d a nos quisieron enfrentar recuerdo mucho su madurez y sus consejos
5451108 le gustaba mucho ordenar y tenerte siempre controlado l era el eje de aquel equipo y por lo tanto era un jugador que mandaba mucho ya era un enfermo del f tbol y no ha cambiado
5451109 no pas bamos por un buen momento ni social ni deportivo y aquello pesa pero a la vez te hace m s fuerte a jugadores como a m y a carles puyol nos pes mucho la verdad es que es triste por suerte nos rehicimos
5451110 las sensaciones que est dando este equipo en la pretemporada la din mica que se ve en el juego el car cter ganador la presi n que hacemos ahora en campo contrario etc son situaciones y sensaciones que me hacen pensar que este a o puede ir muy bien
5451111 so severe that it often drives women and men to suicide

5451113 the number of clients is going up by the day some ask to come at night so theyll not be seen some call whispering sometimes they dont want to give you their name they come saying my husband is going to leave me if i dont have children and the men once they find out they come every day if they have an appointment at 9 a m they show up at 8
5451114 were not looking at this in a punitive way we want to see people if theyre going to be in jail for a number of years lets get them in a training program an apprentice program maybe work towards a journeymans certificate some type of occupational standard that when they finally are released from prison they have some way of taking care of themselves rather than doing that illegally
5451115 i speak to him at least three four five times a week
5451116 in the same way that theres a long tail of content we see a long tail of licensees
5451117 if you talk to a portal or website it can be a nightmare trying to get quality content from a large ip owner most arent geared up to handle those small transactions and queries a large independent tv production company might have a sales team of 20 people but these people dont take phone calls from people offering them 500 in the meantime the person who really wins is the pirate who will upload the content to youtube
5451118 yeah why do you think viacom is suing youtube tf1 suing dailymotion
5451119 youll have to ask the old man about that he was the editor of the sun for 13 years you have to have a certain personality to create that hes a singular character and ive learned a huge amount from him i value his input
5451120 he knows a lot of people in media what you want from chairmen is guidance on strategy and frankly their ability to help you get somewhere you couldnt get yourself they pick up the phone and people will take the call whereas before it might have taken us a bit longer

5451127 brian is home and i want to leave as soon as possible what needs to get done
5451128 only god really knows that but since we have to pick someone to make this choice i believe the choice should rest not with the legislature or the courts but with the women in consultation with her pastor

5451135 max linn is wrong in criticizing this historic piece of legislation it shows his lack of understanding of both the housing foreclosure crisis and the fact that it is worth celebrating that our leaders in congress finally acted in a way that worked through the complexities of the multiple and legitimate needs of different constituencies to craft a comprehensive legislative response that works for all americans
5451136 treasury secretary henry paulson and rep barney frank d ma personified the type of nonpartisan and constructive leadership essential for our system to function in order to solve our nations problems
5451137 when we see our national leaders taking positive collective action it is important to recognize it and express our appreciation

5451157 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
5451158 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
5451159 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law

5451162 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
5451163 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa

5451165 before we tolerated everything they did to us at the plant we worked very hard but we lived free
5451166 now we have no work we are not free and we have no idea what will happen to us
5451167 the first step must be getting off the wrong battlefield in iraq and taking the fight to the terrorists in afghanistan and pakistan this is the war we need to win
5451168 theres not a job on the planet above the pay grade of the president of the united states
5451169 the first step must be getting off the wrong battlefield in iraq and taking the fight to the terrorists in afghanistan and pakistan this is the war we need to win
5451170 as president i would pursue a new strategy and begin by providing at least two additional combat brigades to support our effort in afghanistan
5451171 waste deep in the big muddy the big fool says to push on
5451172 the first step must be getting off the wrong battlefield in iraq and taking the fight to the terrorists in afghanistan and pakistan this is the war we need to win

5451183 la seguridad ciudadana trasciende el mbito policial pues tiene que ver tambi n con las pol ticas del estado que tienen un impacto fuerte en la sociedad y en nuestras barriadas
5451184 dos de los ejes fundamentales de la seguridad ciudadana son caracas segura y ruta segura elementos de seguridad que han tenido comentarios favorables por parte de las barriadas caraque as
5451185 en el rea metropolitana hay alrededor de 5 mil efectivos y a nivel nacional unos 10 mil efectivos porque hemos direccionado el plan caracas segura a otros estados como carabobo bol var aragua lara entre otros con el fin de llegar a completar lo que llamamos venezuela segura
5451186 el programa gubernamental ruta segura ha impactado positivamente al tiempo que se mantienen unos 15 mil efectivos policiales en las calles venezolanas
5451187 forma parte de una integraci n de varias pol ticas p blicas implementadas en cooperaci n con diferentes organismos como la fiscal a general y el tribunal supremo
5451188 queremos dejar atr s la vieja percepci n totalmente represiva y defender estrategias profil cticas ante la incidencia delictiva donde los uniformados interaccionen junto a las comunidades con el mismo prop sito final el bienestar social

5451197 pr ximamente se tendr una f brica de plantas para la creaci n de estas m quinas potabilizadoras de agua en el pa s
5451198 sencillamente lo que hace es desnaturalizar los procesos de integraci n que se est n desarrollando en el seno del parlamento de mercosur y todas las instancias en suram rica
5451199 telesur ha demostrado en tres a os su capacidad de crecimiento sin duda es un hermoso proyecto para que nosotros nos veamos nos conozcamos y nos informemos desde nosotros mismos
5451200 esto demuestra que el proyecto sigue creciendo y fortaleci ndose sigue su expansi n su capacidad de informar con la verdad y la hermosa diversidad de nuestro continente llegando ahora tambi n hasta europa a trav s de una red de canales
5451201 nosotros no nos negamos a que ellos y la senadora adriana pe a ejerzan sus derechos pero deben cumplir con las reglas del organismo inclusivo no se puede poner a una comisi n de derechos humanos tan sensible dentro y fuera del continente en funci n de cuestiones particulares y en este caso en funci n de cuestiones fascistas de venezuela eso fue lo que hizo la senadora integrante de la comisi n
5451202 ellos no han cumplido con procedimientos legales del organismo adem s los que hoy claman justicia fueron los que en abril del a o 2002 encabezaron un golpe de estado en contra del presidente de venezuela hugo ch vez fr as

5451206 rep loretta sanchez says shes happy for the chance to vote for hillary rodham clinton at the democratic national convention and she predicts that as many as half of the democrats in the house could join her
5451207 wallace collins has previously received 4 000 in donations from this secretive organization that took money from injured workers without their knowledge
5451208 collins has used this money for his own political purposes and should return that money at once
5451209 all candidates and those who had received funds from the working oklahomans alliance
5451210 well if were going to ask wallace collins to give back that money then we should ask all of them
5451211 because everyone who got that money should give it back
5451212 i doubt very seriously if any of these candidates or elected officials knew where that money came from
5451213 in campaigns you dont look gift horses in the mouth
5451214 i havent seen any proof that theyve done anything wrong or illegal
5451215 and i would certainly want to see proof of wrongdoing if thats what happened if mr warren can prove theyve done something illegal then id certainly like to know but just because he doesnt agree with them that doesnt mean theyve done anything illegal
5451216 they are registered with the state ethics commission so i dont know how that makes them secretive
5451217 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
5451218 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
5451219 was an attempt to divert attention away from the gops own problems
5451220 it seems strange ironic maybe that a group that has their own ethical problems such as disgraced former speaker lance cargill who is said to be under an ethics investigation for shaking down lobbyists would point the finger at someone else roger warren should worry about the beam in his own eye before he worries about the splinter in mine
5451221 well you guys did it so we get to do it
5451222 she thought moving him next to me would be good for him
5451223 it would take us half a day to write a little note to the other one
5451224 i could remember his hometown but not how to spell it
5451225 when he realized it was me you could have heard the noise he made three blocks away
5451226 they rented a motorhome in halifax and did prince edward island and came across to argentia and drove through newfoundland
5451227 they were nervous but i was nothing only a ball of butterflies
5451228 they cant get over the freedoms we have to go where we want when we want and do what we want
5451229 we have to move away from this total ban and find ways for people to let off steam a little bit more but safely
5451230 weve got to allow political videos but with some safeguards
5451231 its much more open today and we will continue to feel our way forward
5451232 we have to move away from this total ban and find ways for people to let off steam a little bit more but safely
5451233 we will do whatever is necessary and no one should have any illusion
5451234 the russian side is gravely violating the conditions provided for by the peace accord signed by the presidents of georgia france and the russian federation
5451235 persistent delay in the withdrawal of its forces from georgia
5451236 lets then start thinking negotiating how can we prevent the definitive estrangement of our two countries

5451240 nearly all of world population growth is now concentrated in the worlds poorer countries

5451242 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5451243 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5451244 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5451245 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5451246 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5451248 all i will say is that my client maintains his innocence
5451249 was not the bill that was presented at the state level
5451250 we are seeing evidence of ss 21 missiles in south ossetia
5451251 but let me be clear if it rolled in after august 6th it needs to roll out
5451252 that would be in keeping with the russian commitment on withdrawal
5451253 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the ceasefire and should be removed immediately
5451254 the only forces that are permitted to remain under the ceasefire agreement are the forces that were in there at the august 6th timeframe
5451255 were seeing them solidify their positions in south ossetia and abkhazia
5451256 i cant say whether they are actually moving people out right now or not but we do expect them to start moving out we expect them to move out slowly so this may take some time
5451257 when we received news of the first two ss 21 russian missile launchers into georgian territory
5451258 we are seeing evidence of ss 21 missiles in south ossetia
5451259 my family had already seen the film before we did the spanish captions my mother who doesnt speak english watched the film with tears streaming down her face i was very excited to see her reaction when she saw the dialogue in her own language she was so moved that made me very happy
5451260 when i was a teenager i decided to try to make it in entertainment
5451261 i knew also that i wanted to act but in mexico your choices are pretty limited so i auditioned for and got some roles on mexican soap operas telenovelas they were a hit and i became a star in mexico
5451262 i had made one film chasing papi that was the first latino focused film in hollywood
5451263 after i had been studying with her for a while she began to ask me questions like eduardo what are you doing to make your life meaningful
5451264 i was having still having fun but i was empty and not happy
5451265 i made a decision to go live in a monastery just give my life so i sold everything and went to talk to a priest i told him and my family that i was going to go be a missionary in south america
5451266 im so thankful for this angel god sent to me because my life turned around after that leo and i and alejandro formed our company metanoia films it means a conversion or turning toward god that is what has happened in my life everything i do i want to glorify jesus christ because he is the way
5451267 we saw many different scripts for films but nothing was anything we wanted to make so one day alejandro told us i have this story and he told us the story that was
5451268 usually when you make a film you are shooting each scene many times to get just the right feel and the right lighting
5451269 we were shooting in new york and so it was a little crazy sometimes setting up for a scene and hoping that the people and traffic around would work with us were very happy with the end result and got it done in 24 days
5451270 no that didnt come from my family but i did have two really close friends in mexico theyre very well known and for several years have had a public disagreement they wouldnt talk with each other or do anything like that
5451271 im very excited about the stories weve heard because i realize we accomplished what we wanted to do inspire and entertain people im very happy and excited about the results and very thankful to god
5451272 weve had many people contact us about possible projects but we want to be sure they meet our companys guideline to make inspiring educational and entertaining films that people will see and then go to do something for others

5451275 it will take some time to bring the density within a safe limit
5451276 in addition a large majority 69 per cent of the experts considers pakistan the country most likely to transfer nuclear technology to terrorists
5451277 in 2007 10 per cent of experts named the iraq war as the greatest threat to us security in may 2008 not a single expert did
5451278 were all in this together and the people of pakistan and the government of pakistan know that
5451279 so were confident that while we certainly all have more to do when it comes to fighting terrorism the government of pakistan will continue in the effort
5451280 while this political process is under way we certainly expect theyll keep up their fight against terrorists and extremists and because of what i just said this is a fight that they are in as well
5451281 thats what the prime minister said when he was in washington
5451282 president bush is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5451283 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5451284 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5451285 the extremist ideology is one that has been out there and among these groups for many years
5451286 lets be very clear about where this started and thats with the extremists
5451287 a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5451288 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism
5451289 we amp squo re all in this together and the people of pakistan and the government of pakistan know that

5451297 i hope you will respect yourself enough not to be talked into doing something you know to be wrong learn to say no ultimately you answer to god
5451298 it is necessary for most of the populace to cling to the myth that only bad people raise monsters
5451299 im not using or implying the term bad people im just questioning the term heroes i think most all of us fall somewhere in between

5451303 the clock is ticking for the chinese government to demonstrate its good faith regarding these so called protest zones
5451304 we think that you do not really understand chinas reality china has its own version and way of exercising our democracy
5451305 justifiable concerns about the whereabouts and safety of those individuals
5451306 china is presenting itself as a place with democratic freedoms where everyone has the right to protest even during the olympics but in reality the protest permits wont be granted

5451327 walgreens has the ability to create a project less intrusive than something else that could be there

5451330 designed and constructed to ensure proper conveyance of floodwaters and to eliminate the potential to cause backwater flooding on either side of the u s mexico border
5451331 remove debris from the fence within washes arroyos immediately after rain events to ensure that no backwater flooding occurs
5451332 the callousness displayed by homeland security in ignoring warnings to damage a national treasure is mind boggling
5451333 the border wall does not stop humans but it will stop jaguars and other wildlife it is already wreaking havoc on the southern part of organ pipe national monument
5451334 the contrast between the report findings and the environmental assessment displays the bush administrations wholly meaningless approach to environmental analysis
5451335 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
5451336 its time for homeland security to lift its embargo on environmental laws the border fence does not stop humans now we have more proof of the walls destruction of our national treasures

5451355 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
5451356 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5451357 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant
5451358 these interrogations and checkpoints are comparable to police practices in authoritarian regimes and especially apartheid era south africa which is even more ominous given the fact the residents of these new red zones are mostly african american and poor
5451359 such measures also recall the repression by police and private security firms in post katrina new orleans which accompanied the obstruction and expulsion of mostly poor and black residents from their homes
5451360 these policies have only empowered criminal gangs involved in the drug trade just as prohibition fed the growth of organized crime the aclu is right two of our most important freedoms the right of mobility and protection against warrantless search and seizure are being nullified for the sake of the disastrous war on drugs in violation of local law and the us constitution

5451474 9 11 cts dont even rise to the level of myth just a bunch of stupid lies
5451475 you post a lie it is proven 100 false you move the goalposts and post yet another lie and it continues on around till were back to the original lie as if it will somehow become true if its re iterated again the same misquotes over and over again the same hindsight bias appeals to authority etc
5451476 why hasnt mythbusters done a model of the collapse of a wtc tower

5451483 state street global markets has historically lacked a fixed income presence but over the past two years weve started to build up that operation
5451484 we dont carry any inventory and we dont issue any new bonds we connect the buy side to their counterparts thats it
5451485 we think a big advantage in todays market is to provide additional liquidity and we wont be building a short position while selling something long out to our clientele or vice versa
5451486 we also arent putting any capital to use and only match interest based on client needs
5451487 our sweet spot is in the corporate and asset backed space where weve send a majority of our activity
5451488 we have clients spread across the european region and the u s its really a cross border platform and it spans the currencies
5451489 it doesnt really exist in the fixed income space but were trying to get as close we can by matching up client interest off line in an anonymous one to many or one to one basis

5451497 im just fearful that they dont get caught up on a trap like they did before
5451498 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5451499 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5451500 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5451501 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5451502 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5451503 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5451504 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5451505 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5451506 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5451507 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5451508 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5451509 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5451510 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5451511 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

5451548 ive also had an orientation toward asia and a recognition that over time we are going to see more economic growth
5451549 in fact reading obamas absorbing 1995 memoir dreams from my father it strikes me that the tropes that surround and define obama can just as easily be read as those of another community entirely which raises the question could it be that our true first black president might also be our first asian american president

5451649 we agreed that you wouldnt quote shakespeare to me for at least a month
5451650 im not certain that mrs mahon is talking about that kind of love
5451651 well of course mrs mahon is a concubine or perhaps it is more accurate to say that she occasionally plays the concubine
5451652 mrs mahon is embracing sin as a friend because really what else can she do she must eat
5451653 yeah my sons just not good enough to make the nhl too bad
5451654 we think that operation sentinel and a lot of the surveillance initiatives that the police are planning are an attack on our right to privacy here in new york

5451661 in any case these machines are no longer running vista
5451662 the 35 is only an estimate but it shows a trend within our own user base
5451663 vistas installed base certainly doesnt equal the number of vista licenses that microsofts sold
5451664 one client is not doing vista at all but theyre refreshing their entire platform this year

5451681 what were looking at is a fire sale of properties in newer affordable neighborhoods that were bought or refinanced near the price peak with lousy mortgages what were still not seeing is this level of distress spreading to more expensive or established neighborhoods
5451682 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5451683 yes i prefer burger kings burger to mcdonalds however i find the mcdonald chicken mcnugget superior to burger kings chicken tender
5451684 honey i agree with you on the burgers but not so much on the chicken for chicken fingers i think you have to go with wendys
5451685 are you fucking kidding me you think burger king has better burgers if thats true than why is mcdonalds the biggest burger company you dont know shit youre so stupid
5451686 im stupid you friggin idiot youre the one who just follows the herd like a lemming
5451687 nosotros tambi n lo decimos si la ley lo permite pues que vengan no tendremos m s remedio que aguantarnos otra cosa es que en estos momentos la ley vigente no lo permite y efectivamente se est construyendo una tiende de descuento duro concretamente lidl perteneciente a una cadena de distribuci n alemana
5451688 si lo que se pretende es permitirle a dicha cadena que vaya trabajando que se presente con otro formato para que cuando llegue el momento de la aplicaci n de la directiva blokestein de la uni n europea 1 o1 2010 o cuando simplemente se reforme la actual ley de comercio pueda salir al mercado como una tienda de descuento duro eso nos parece lamentable
5451689 unas veces nos dicen que s se van a autorizar las tiendas de descuento duro otras que no el pasado fin de semana publica la prensa que en opini n de este se or no es segura la llegada de cadena lidl por otro lado el mismo consejero del gobierno de canarias reconoce que se van a autorizar una libertad total para que se instalen nuevas grandes superficies en el sur de tenerife de gran canaria y en islas como lanzarote y fuerteventura lo cierto es que con tanta incertidumbre no nos hacen ning n bien al peque o y mediano comercio es hora que dejen de contarnos historias y que nos devuelvan la confianza
5451690 nosotros no vamos a pedir su dimisi n nunca lo hemos hecho en relaci n a nadie ahora bien nosotros s sabemos que este se or no es amigo del peque o y mediano comercio l solo es amigo de sus amigos y si me lo preguntaran decididamente dir a que prefiero que haya otra persona en ese cargo tan importante tenemos una reuni n prevista con el presidente del gobierno de canarias all le presentaremos nuestras propuestas para poder afrontar los dif ciles momentos por los que pasa el comercio en canarias hasta ahora estamos muy dolidos y extra ados con lo que est pasando no se nos ha consultado ni tenido en cuenta para nada claramente se ha visto que no tienen inter s en favorecer al peque o y mediano comercio nos tienen abandonados no hay m s que ver las grandes inversiones en infraestructuras que hacen para favorecer la implantaci n de las grandes superficies mientras que en las ciudades y pueblos de canarias seguimos sin aparcamientos y con enormes dificultades de movilidad lamentablemente conocemos muy bien al actual director general de comercio y no creo que bajo su mandato se vaya a producir ning n arreglo seguir n favoreciendo a los de fuera y perjudicando a los de aqu de ello no tenemos la menor duda
5451691 nosotros no vamos a pedir su dimisi n nunca lo hemos hecho en relaci n a nadie

5451722 this legislation represents a real threat to the vibrancy of that online environment
5451723 the activity online proves that a broad range of stakeholders with varying interests and vantage points care deeply about this issue
5451724 there are so many canadians that have issues will this bill
5451725 and the online forum has helped us get informed which leads to offline rallies

5451744 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
5451745 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5451746 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant

5451769 randomized blinded placebo controlled clinical trials have shown that three to four months of conventional acne therapy including topical benzoyl peroxide topical retinoids and oral antibiotics typically produces reductions in lesion counts in the 40 percent to 60 percent range
5451770 it has also been suggested that the incidence of scarring from facial acne approaches 95 percent thus adolescents marked preference for total clearance over partial 50 percent clearance or clearance with scarring suggests that physicians must weigh high patient expectations against these clinical data

5451824 if you have a guy at homeplate you never come up and try to hit the guy in the chest i felt that was an illegal slide and the umpire should have ejected him after that the game got out of hand

5451840 assessing the condition of oil related infrastructure cleaning up oil spills or other environmental damage at oil facilities engineering design and repair or reconstruction of damaged infrastructure assisting in making facilities operational distribution of petroleum products and assisting the iraqis in resuming iraqi oil company operations
5451841 the fact that the department was planning for the possibility that it would need to repair and provide for continuity of operations of the iraqi oil infrastructure was classified until march 2003
5451842 this prevented earlier acknowledgement or announcement of potential requirements to the business community
5451843 the u s considered such contingency planning necessary because of saddam husseins actions in kuwait in 1991 when iraqi forces damaged 750 wells
5451844 that destruction resulted in an environmental disaster as well as a tremendous blow to kuwaits oil production capability
5451845 from behind the obsidian mirrors of his wraparound sunglasses ray rodon surveys the vast desert landscape of southern iraqs rumailah oilfield a project manager with halliburtons engineering and construction division kellogg brown amp root rodon has spent months preparing for the daunting task of repairing iraqs oil industry working first at headquarters in houston and then out of a hotel room in kuwait city he has studied the intricacies of the iraqi national oil company even reviewing the firms organizational charts so that halliburton and the army can ascertain which iraqis are reliable technocrats and which are saddam loyalists
5451846 rodon represents the vanguard of what is expected to be a growing army of halliburton employees in iraq where the u s is preparing to embark on the grandest exercise in nation building since its occupation of japan after world war ii at the center of that undertaking will be u s companies with halliburton probably chief among them
5451847 indeed texans wearing kbr baseball caps are arriving by the planeload at kuwaits airport
5451848 the liberation of iraq couldnt come at a better time for halliburton whose business has been dogged by a host of troubles from a slowdown in domestic oil production to nightmare asbestos litigation last year revenues declined 6 to 12 6 billion and the company reported a net loss of 984 million but ceo dave lesar who took over when his predecessor dick cheney went to washington is starting to put halliburtons problems behind it he has cut costs sold unproductive assets curtailed money losing overseas operations and devised a bold plan to settle asbestos related lawsuits
5451849 the dod through its us army logistics civil augmentation program logcap iii contract with kbr tapped the company in november 2002 to develop the contingency plan implementation of the plan is being executed through a separate contract kellogg brown amp root now holds with the us army corps of engineers
5451850 kbr was selected for the iraq contract based on the fact that kbr is the only contractor that could commence implementing the complex contingency plan on extremely short notice
5451851 we made the contract broad enough so we could handle issues just like this

5451856 the ones who killed my husband they have money and they threw me in jail i am 100 per cent innocent i have no one no brother to look after me

5451890 we believe the oxyotr tm accessory package is one of the few and most compelling otr innovations in the past five years
5451891 several companies have offered otr testing equipment for many years and their systems have earned a reputation as essential equipment for otr testing but we think labs will find many reasons to incorporate the new cost effective oxyotr tm in their laboratories
5451892 the oxyotr tm add on is not intended to replace existing otr equipment from industry leaders such as mocon and dansensor but rather to offer a cost effective way of expanding a labs otr testing capacity
5451893 oxysense r was the only supplier that offered a fully integrated system with the required operating and testing capabilities
5451894 the oxyotr tm add on offers laboratories a distinctive advantage in being able to test finished packaging even those filled with real product which have been sealed on the production line
5451895 the oxyotr tm accessory system is designed to provide cost conscious labs with something theyve never had before a cost effective alternative for gaining access to or expanding their oxygen testing capabilities we believe its going to have a big impact on the industry

5451908 one of the most fun things in the preseason is that the cameramen are still getting into shape too
5451909 they told me we were gonna get a roommate and it was gonna be the prince the vietnamese called him the prince so i asked my nurse what was his name they said john mccain
5451910 i took one look at him and my brain instantly said they dropped this guy off on me to claim that we let him die
5451911 he was just emaciated very very skinny in this full body cast just filthy
5451912 he had this gimpy knee where hed busted his knee this arm had been fractured in a couple places hed been bayoneted in the leg this arm was out at the shoulder and in fact during that time it was out at the shoulder so long it wore a hole in this bone
5451913 they roped me under the arms tied my hands behind my back ran another rope to that got me up on a chair threw that rope up over a rafter and jerked the chair out from under me and your own weight just tears your body apart
5451914 john said well well gather up some bamboo and he was in a bandage on his leg at that time so i got some strips of bamboo smuggled them into the room john put his foot in my arm pit and pulled on my wrist till we could get the bone forced back down it wasnt exactly perfect but it worked out he got it back to where it was functional
5451915 i mean you could smell him for 25 feet bunch of food and nasty stuff in his hair and down his neck and inside his cast the cast was not lined so every time he would move inside this cast it was just eating a hole in his arm or his elbow or someplace and he was just in he was in pain
5451916 and when i finally did regain use of that it was after months and months of dragging this hand and finger on the wall of the prison cell
5451917 john would help me john would pull my fingers out straight they would just instantly recurl and finally one morning i had just the slightest bit of movement in this hand finger and we both cried
5451918 it also wasnt in his playbook to die in fact he quickly became a leader
5451919 he said sure he had a great handle on the episcopalian liturgy he could just repeat it verbatim
5451920 ive never seen any shortcomings or any shortfall out of him talking about that but he just doesnt trade on that i think he feels that its wrong to trade on being a hero but he is

5452042 the macro economic factors pressuring consumers and the ongoing challenges and uncertainty of the financial markets suggest a cautious sales forecast for the balance of fiscal 2008 is prudent

5452048 you have seen that pakistans stock market has responded very positively and you have seen that the rupee has appreciated against the dollar and the restoration of judges will only improve things even further
5452049 we are very clear and consistent in our stance that general pervez musharraf should be brought into a court of law to answer for the crimes he has committed against the people of pakistan

5452071 we took the same approach to this record as weve done to our previous records which is actually a lack of approach
5452072 theres no approach its just show up and lets play theres no plan we dont map it out we dont decide on a direction we just kind of let it happen real naturally thats how it happened
5452073 but what we do have is writing constantly while were touring any idea we have well try it we dont want to limit ourselves
5452074 weve always wrote about the number of songs that would end up on our records youre not going to hear long lost rise against b sides we rarely have anything extra but this time we wrote some 30 pretty solid ideas things were just flowing out of us we just kept spitting songs out we had to boil that down to a record that was the hard part
5452075 the chorus its definitely taking and looking at where we get our information from and whos telling us the information and whos right and whos wrong and how everything we do has some kind of spin on it and who can you trust
5452076 how we were brought up how we were raised everything and how we separate the truth from the lies and our entire upbringing and when it really boils down its hard to see what we know is true and what we know is false its interesting thought
5452077 thats something we deal with when we play shows that have a recruitment tent
5452078 theres a guy from the army roping in kids were talking about those kids who see the army as an option when i was 17 years old i met with an army recruiter because i considered joining the army the armed forces i wanted to go out and see places and do this we get a lot of e mails from kids who are soldiers all branches from the armed services they come out to our shows they tell you their stories and their stories are in the first verse a sum of a lot of the stories that ive heard
5452079 neil young documented the kent state shootings in ohio and so many bands like creedence clearwater revival and buffalo springfield did so much
5452080 i learned more about the vietnam war from bands like that than i did from the history books as this war is hopefully coming to a close and as stories of what happened are coming out i needed to write a song that dealt with the reality of war
5452081 its a good way to start off this new record because i think the album has a lot of progression and something different to offer
5452082 its still about reaching people putting what were giving into these people making them think and challenge the ways of thought creating conversation and dialogue and putting new ideas forth for people to consider
5452083 and when you have a bigger fanbase thats even more fun to do because all of a sudden your voice is louder now you have a bigger bullhorn than you actually have its exciting and fun and i look forward to the next couple years with this record now that we have a fanbase its just a question of what are we going to do when weve been given the privilege that weve been given
5452084 just eat tofu and carrots or stop complaining to me about it

5452127 we are incredibly happy healthy and very much together here in los angeles recording our new record
5452128 besides this ridiculously overblown lawsuit we are having one of the most inspiring wonderful and exciting times that weve experienced to date
5452129 so as you may have heard we are being sued by our former record company for the ridiculously oversized totally unrealistic and pretty silly but slightly clever sum of 30 000 000 insane yea thats what we said too
5452130 we had been signed to our record contract for 9 years
5452131 basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than 7 years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts
5452132 not for failing to deliver music or for quitting but simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5452133 shouldnt a record company be able to turn a profit from selling that many records or at the very least break even we think so

5452159 good god what are you doing here better yet why out at this hour is everything all right
5452160 ah finally awake are you alright what happened mary was all tears she called every one when you went unconscious on them last night
5452161 i dont know mary and some guy so what happened were you mugged
5452162 she was here she left a couple of hours ago she said you went to some girls house last night
5452163 how did she know about that nothing happened i just drove her home
5452164 its none of my business but is that why your phone was switched off for more than 55 minutes when you were at sherins place
5452165 look nothing happened i didnt switch my phone off who told you that
5452166 mary of course she was outside sherins house the whole time i believe you saw them when you left
5452167 i dont know she mentioned his name once yes zufran dont you know him
5452168 i dont but i am in deep trouble now arent i she called me when i was there i didnt want to lie and i knew if told her i was at sherins place she wouldnt understand mary knows we used to date so i thought id come home and call her that way i could say i was at home it wouldnt be a lie
5452169 sounds like you got a lot of explaining to do oh and by the way sherin has called you a bunch of times
5452170 how did she get my number this looks bad doesnt it did you answer her does mary know
5452171 yes this is he who wants to know and why
5452172 the only moment brinkley drops her smile is when john edwards comes up
5452173 it was a little learning process early in camp but the last 10 days or so ive felt really really comfortable there on the left side
5452174 i feel like im kind of picking up where i left off
5452175 hes played both of them for us and we think hes played at a high level we thought it was natural the way the draft fell and being able to get a tackle in the draft that we felt was worthy of starting we felt that moving gross gave us the best chance at the tackle positions
5452176 honestly its not something im disgruntled about or anything like that
5452177 im not unhappy with it some guys are mad and they hold out
5452178 it didnt work out and i think we had different ideas about the parameters of the contract well see how it goes this year all we can do is have a good year and win some games everyone on the negotiating side gets along and likes each other it just didnt happen
5452179 ive never been a look down the road type of guy
5452180 especially because ive been moving back and forth every year i dont have time to look down the road
5452181 but being on the left side now if i have a great year well that is the spot on the o line that is most touted so that could be a good thing well see what happens
5452182 yeah i think were the side with the older players and the ones they can count on to know whats going on
5452183 right guard keydrick vincent and otah are learning still but they are doing a nice job but we defi nitely feel like the left side is the side that is going to be accountable every week
5452184 the first game against indianapolis went really well but that was a different type of defense than philadelphia played
5452185 after the rain delay i felt like the first offense did a better job yeah we came out slow and that might be training camp legs i dont know
5452186 but im excited about what our offense is doing this year and i think jake is looking good once we get everyone back on the field i think well have a good unit out there

5452206 this is a significant milestone for the company as it represents the first true senior debt the company has secured i am proud of the team that put this financing together in a time when financial markets are struggling this debt comes with excellent terms and gives bpz the needed capital to continue appraising the assets in our acreage with 215 million of credit capacity in place along with corvina oil sales bpz should not have to access the capital markets to fund our upcoming capital expenditures
5452207 in addition as we are able to use a portion of this credit facility to secure the turbines for our power plant we are essentially breaking ground on our gas to power project we have sufficient gas in our corvina field to supply gas to the power plant for the next 10 plus years and this closing of the senior debt will now give us the ability to move forward with monetizing that gas perus power demand is growing year on year and we expect to be able to increase the size of the plant in the future the power plant will be located next to an existing substation thus allowing us to connect to perus national power transmission grid after the power plant is complete

5452422 the ongoing bundling of mobile packages bundled with broadband and fixed line services are creating offers which fixed line and broadband providers are unable to match
5452423 integrated fixed and mobile companies particularly those with a dominant position in mobile and a low share of fixed line are able to extract monopoly profits from their dominant mobile position and cross subsidise their fixed services
5452424 in addition callplus would expect that mobile to mobile termination rates would be in step with fixed to mobile rates as any artificial difference would drive substitution between fixed and mobile calling or the other way
5452425 to date the mobile operators have managed to bargain themselves out of having termination rates regulated by agreeing to a price decrease of one cent per year which has ensured their monopoly profits on mobile calls

5452444 people have responded to richard and judy because there has been no agenda
5452445 there have been such a wide range of recommendations and our customers really have come to trust the books they choose
5452446 its a fresh modern and exciting channel with books at its centre
5452447 time will tell whether the new show will be successful
5452448 uktv right now doesnt have a broad audience base and the richard amp judy show itself had been losing some viewers on channel 4 that said i think it is quite a coup for uktv in getting them to move to what is essentially a niche broadcaster
5452449 the move to uktv may actually help because i think they may put more energy behind books
5452450 but the power is in the stickers on the books when we put the books into our range they sell before and after the programmes air
5452451 i think the point now is that the book club and summer reads are totally outside the show
5452452 in a way it doesnt really matter about the show it is about the brand
5452453 the interesting thing is to look at how it will still be doing three or four years down the line if the show doesnt get the viewers will the brand decline i dont think so but i think retailers need to get behind it and publishers need to see that it is still important and continue to put forward the right books
5452454 it is like heinz baked beans suddenly being taken out of all the supermarkets and you could only get them in corner shops people would still buy them because they are a great brand but after a while when they are not front and centre they lose traction
5452455 richard and judy have to shout a little louder if they want to be more than just a niche programme and need to work all that much harder
5452456 they are not quite oprah but they do have resonance
5452457 some brands do disappear but if they continue to find the right partners and look to extend the richard amp judy brand they can keep the buzz going

5452486 i think theyve lost the plot what are they doing where are they going whats happening i dont get it any more they lost me i still appreciate what theyre doing or what theyre trying to do but i think theyre trying too hard not to be radiohead that seems a little ridiculous to me
5452487 i like them as a rock band all the buttons and sequencing and stuff like that i dont really care for im a fan of rock music and what theyre doing now i dont think is very good when you have that kind of money you can put on a great performance regardless of what you do if you cant go out and pick up your instruments and play a good show that doesnt do it for me i dont have any interest in that

5452548 poverty is seldom discussed in the state capitol and is generally treated as an insolvable problem it is time for lawmakers to not only make ending poverty a state priority but to be held accountable for their success in doing so
5452549 new york has a particularly unfair system of state and local taxes where the poor pay more as a percent of their income than the wealthy
5452550 the state budgetary needs should be met through tax fairness that restores the principle that those who can most afford it bear a greater share of the burden

5452555 sinceramente acho que ainda est tudo em aberto muito em especial no que se refere ao francisco mancebo e quilo que ele ainda pode conquistar mas n o ser f cil a primeira parte da prova foi um pouco estranha pelo que s posso acreditar que o que falta at chegada a felgueiras s pode ser melhor
5452556 mal t nhamos partido e ele j estava vomitar o que o debilitou para o resto da etapa e comprometeu irremediavelmente as suas aspira es no mais o grupo est bem fisicamente e consciente que na segunda parte da volta tem de aparecer e fazer bastante melhor do que o conseguido at ao momento
5452557 foi um dia de testes muito positivo sucederam algumas situa es oriundas da juventude do carro de n o ter sido constru do de raiz para provas de circuito ou pista sendo apenas concebido para provas de montanha onde em espanha o carro campe o em t tulo
5452558 no entanto o silver car est a dar os primeiros passos em provas de circuito tendo at ao momento demonstrado todo o seu potencial com pequenos ajustes que torna o silver car muito competitivo aqui no teste de hoje em braga sucederam duas situa es normais de competi o foi bom que tivesse sucedido aqui em vez de numa prova
5452559 primeiro surgiu um problema de desgaste de uma r tula e o apoio do escape que motivado pelas altas temperaturas acabou por partir levando destrui o dum fole da transmiss o que foi logo substitu do pela equipe t cnica da multit cnica competi es
5452560 tendo em conta as voltas que dei pista onde nunca tinha andado nem conhecia consegui fazer um crono de 1 24 8 que depois vim a saber que foi um bom tempo tendo em considera o que o rapport n o era o mais indicado penso que com a mudan a do rapport com certeza que os tempos melhoravam substancialmente com o auxilio de mais alguns acertos t cnicos
5452561 estreei o carro nesta prova correu bem terminando no 4 lugar da geral e foi uma demonstra o clara que t nhamos carro para discutir as posi es da frente foi uma prova feita com muita cautela j que n o houve tempo para rodar o carro antes pois o mesmo chegou uns dias antes oriundo da f brica em espanha
5452562 depois foi a serra da estrela onde contamos com o apoio de f brica que esteve presente ajudando e muito nos acertos do carro e no final fui o 2 melhor piloto portugu s em prova de seguida surge figueir dos vinhos tive problemas com os pneus que n o eram os mais indicados para esta rampa para al m de nos debatermos com alguns acertos t cnicos ao ponto de ter dado um toque numa das subidas
5452563 j em bragan a duas semanas mais tarde foi uma prova que correu muito bem foi uma nossa aposta tendo aplicado pneus novos e n o fossem as falhas no arranque poderia ter ganho a rampa finalmente em mur a voltamos a ter problemas com os pneus ao ponto de ter piorado os tempos quando da minha 1 passagem por esta mesma rampa os acertos escolhidos n o foram os mais acertados o que n o normal pois ainda estou a conhecer os segredos do carro

5452569 the most normal thing in the world theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing
5452570 why are you asking me that question im being as honest as i can possibly can be
5452571 i ended a relationship because there is no lying i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right i dont waste peoples time
5452572 i guarantee you that 20 percent of the people on this street right now who are in a relationship wish they could get out but they dont know how and im going to be honest on the way in to my relationships and im going to be honest on the way out of my relationships
5452573 ive been a doctor for 35 years and this is the first time ive ever seen such a thing happen this is somewhat of a medical miracle weve informed the health ministry and i guess theyll appoint a commission of inquiry the hospital will ask for an external investigation of the case

5452593 absolutely it can arise in many different ways but one of the areas where this comes up most frequently is in making child custody decisions without some guiding principles how do you decide what is in the best interest of the child i often use this example and i havent seen anybody publish it yet if you had a child custody case in which the parents appeared otherwise equally able to parent the child but one was a christian or a jewish person and the other was a satanist who do you give the child to the answer to that question is a religious answer you seldom have that extreme but you have variations of that issue that arise in child custody cases that is just an extreme example but the principle comes up in all kinds of situations of the law

5452610 vi nsker ikke en tilspidsning af situationen vi nsker at man respekterer os respekterer vort folk og det vi st r for
5452611 russerne nsker respekt som en gadedreng med en kniv i h nden
5452612 russerne bliver f rst villige til at spille med vesten efter vestlige regler hvis de ser reglerne som en fordel for dem selv i dag kan de ikke konkurrere p eus regler endnu mindre p usas s de opfinder deres egne
5452613 det nye sf st r for en tankegang om at indvandrere mere eller mindre skal assimileres og indordne sig man ser ikke l ngere integration som en tosidig ting og accepterer ikke at vores samfund er ved at ndre sig sfs ledelse er mere optaget af hvad der er stemmer i man s lger flygtninges rettigheder og respekten for indvandrere ved at give k b p idealerne
5452614 vi har alle sammen oplevet at vi m ske nok er et mindretal i partiet men n r partiledelsen ligefrem laver et frivilligt f lles udspil med socialdemokraterne som vi er s grundl ggende uenige med p det her omr de s er det en beslutning fra h jeste sted som vi ikke kommer v k fra lige forel big s kan vi r be og skrige s meget p bagklappen som vi vil
5452615 det er den mest triste del af socialdemokratisk politik man er g et ind p nemlig tankegangen om at der er noget galt med dem der kommer hertil det er vinklen p alle 14 punkter i udspillet selv med de bedste intentioner udtrykker det en dyb mangel p respekt for de her mennesker
5452616 under valgkampen fik vi hele tiden at vide at sf ikke skulle tale om asylpolitik fordi det var en tabersag at man bare risikerede at folk pillede os ned og misforstod os i stedet skulle det hele handle om skoler milj og ldre
5452617 lige pr cis udfaldet mod en lille lovlig og i vrigt fredelig forening som hizb ut tahrir er helt ude af proportioner og helt malplaceret i et samfund hvor vi har en vanvittig hetz imod alle muslimer jeg synes ikke at der er brug for flere skillelinjer jeg synes der er brug for dialog respekt og en ordentlig omgangstone men det ville ledelsen ikke h re p
5452618 lige som de radikale s skulle man have holdt fast man er n dt til at g foran med de ting som man virkelig synes er rigtige i stedet for at f lge med en folkestemning som er helt vanvittig jeg tror ikke at man kan ndre noget ved blindt at f lge efter befolkningens d rlige stemninger
5452619 der er gr nser for hvor mange kompromisser man kan indg hvis der kommer en regering med s og sf s er der ingen opposition tilbage i danmark s st r de radikale og enhedslisten helt alene med deres f procent stemmer til at forsvare hele det humanistiske verdensbillede og respekten for internationale konventioner
5452620 til en vis grad har det v ret en rigtig strategi at professionalisere vores kommunikation noget mere men det er trist n r det kommer ind over politikken og selv ns budskab bliver designet for at samle v lgere vi er et parti og ikke en koncern det handler faktisk om id er og idealer for hvordan vi nsker samfundet skal se ud
5452621 alle ved der vil ske noget i zimbabwe donorerne er ved at aftale hvilken rolle hvert land skal have men danmark s tter sig selv uden for d ren
5452622 vi er n dt til at vide hvad zimbabwe nsker at det internationale donorsamfund skal bidrage med f r vi indg r i dialog
5452623 ministerens indsats er meget reaktiv og forsigtig danmark sover i timen her fordi vi s tter os uden for d ren i forhold til noget vi gerne vil
5452624 observat rerne kan ikke deltage seri st og trov rdigt i den tentative planl gning med fn og andre donorer n r der ikke er et politisk mandat fra ministeren
5452625 n r danmark er sidst i r kken betyder det at vi ingen indflydelse f r p processen og vi bliver sidst i k en n r der skal v lges hvem der skal lave hvad vi opfordrer ulla t rn s til at tr ffe en beslutning ellers vil opgaverne blive overladt til nogle donorer der er d rligere til at klare opgaverne end danmark
5452626 vi baserer vores samarbejde med et land p baggrund af landets prioriteringer og nsker n r de stadig forhandler mener jeg ikke det vil v re hverken korrekt eller nskeligt at vi formulerer en langsigtet strategi for zimbabwe
5452627 men vi laver ikke en forkromet overtagelsesplan af et land

5452629 we have allowed andy to go on loan to go to bristol city until the january transfer window
5452630 we feel it will be beneficial for him to get regular football there and we hope he can return to the level we all know he is capable of
5452631 andy has had a torrid time since he arrived at rangers and it will be good for him to get games every week in another environment
5452632 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5452633 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5452634 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5452635 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5452636 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5452637 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5452638 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5452639 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5452640 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5452641 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5452642 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5452643 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5452644 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5452645 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5452646 the hope is so high that it will have some effect that everybodys asking for it
5452647 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
5452648 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5452649 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant
5452650 poverty is seldom discussed in the state capitol and is generally treated as an insolvable problem it is time for lawmakers to not only make ending poverty a state priority but to be held accountable for their success in doing so
5452651 new york has a particularly unfair system of state and local taxes where the poor pay more as a percent of their income than the wealthy
5452652 the state budgetary needs should be met through tax fairness that restores the principle that those who can most afford it bear a greater share of the burden
5452653 the purpose of us going up to toronto for two games is just preparation for our upcoming season

5452659 one of the curious aspects of pixars story is that each of the leaders was by conventional standards a failure at the time he came onto the scene animator superstar john lasseter landed his dream job at disney out of college and had just been fired from it tech genius and founding ceo ed catmull had done well respected work as a graduate student in computer graphics but had been turned down for a teaching position and ended up in what he felt was a dead end software development job alvy ray smith the companys co founder had checked out of academia got work at xeroxs famous palo alto research center and then abruptly found himself on the street steve jobs had endured humiliation and pain as he was rejected by apple computer overnight he had transformed from boy wonder of silicon valley to a roundly ridiculed has been

5452661 as the software industry began to gel in the mid 1980s they wrote computer manuals hawking their soft cover books at conferences

5452667 but i would submit this will be a much more advanced system than they have in place
5452668 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5452669 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5452670 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5452671 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5452672 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5452674 karl rove has already declared congressman steve kagen their 1 candidate to beat in 2008

5452677 karl rove has no recollection of ever saying that rep steve kagen was the number 1 candidate to beat in 2008 perhaps his recollection of karl saying this is as vivid and wrong as that of his first visit to the white house

5452680 lower their taxes these hard working millionaires pay way too much to the us government and it must be getting them down and effecting their play
5452681 we just wanted to try something different we always do our industry panels at every convention where we go through our trailers promote our shows and do a q amp a we wanted to mix it up a bit and present ourselves in a different way
5452682 we had never done a night panel before a couple of us from bandai went to one of geneons last year just as attendees it was really fun we liked the atmosphere and it had a different vibe from the industry panels during the day
5452683 its case by case we dont want to do it every time because itll lose its uniqueness otakon specifically has a nice nighttime atmosphere i wouldnt be surprised if it happened again in the future
5452684 it was the business side of it i really didnt want to do it because i love football and running around
5452685 it was really no big deal it gave me extended time to further prepare myself for the season
5452686 but he was competing and fighting hell probably be a little sore tomorrow but hes in good shape
5452687 i cant worry about it now i havent lost faith in them i still think they want me here thats all ive got to go on
5452688 if she had nothing shed find something to give you
5452689 weve had time in the past i think were all going on six years together now reading body language coming out of routes is big for me and i think seeing them run those routes for six years has spoken for itself
5452690 it came out and went right back in on the field
5452691 with the position he plays it shouldnt be an issue as it would with some positions
5452692 you normally dont game plan until the third game if theres one position ive got to hang my hat on its our offensive line im more than confident that theres nobody more capable than those guys to keep me clean
5452693 beginning to walk but by no means were they running
5452694 if that was a u s brigade it would not have gone into combat
5452695 from what ive heard a lot of the 4th brigade was hit pretty hard
5452696 some of the soldiers seemed really grateful for the things we taught them
5452697 come from the hills of georgia and some of them sign for their paycheck with an x
5452698 overall goal is to bring georgia up to nato standards
5452699 i know specifically that bravo company im sure and i hope from what i did for them that theyre better off than they would have been if this happened four weeks ago
5452700 it was not an absolutely decisive factor whether georgians were trained by americans or not
5452701 what happened was due to the political decision of georgian authorities and not the performance on the ground
5452702 im not saying that were suffering here with the one million thread count sheets or checking out the local females at the pool
5452703 but if our job now is to sit here and put down roots in the couch id rather do it at home
5452704 as you know you have to go to war with the army you have not the army you want
5452705 to me anyone whos using ie is so blatantly irresponsible and reckless regarding security that they dont deserve such a classification

5453323 theyre heavily concentrated in states where home prices are plummeting
5453324 could go down the street and get that loan somewhere else
5453325 it was pretty evident that the only thing that was supporting these loans was higher home prices
5453326 the home buying public is going to have to pay
5453327 i tell you solemnly it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven yes i tell you again it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven
5453328 the moment we think this problem in washington is not going to get solved we have to pull the plug because all were doing is wasting money
5453329 theyre not going to chase a company whose business model has been broken so if it doesnt feel like its headed towards a solution were done
5453330 dichosos por encontrarse juntos esos esp ritus se buscan unos a otros
5453331 si unos encarnan y otros no no por eso dejan de estar unidos por el pensamiento los que se conservan libres velan y auxilian a los que se hallan en cautiverio
5453332 pueden por tanto los esp ritus recorrer as ilimitado n mero de existencias corp reas sin que ning n golpe reciba la estima mutua que los une
5453333 del hecho de que un hombre haya tenido diez encarnaciones no se sigue que va a encontrar en el mundo de los esp ritus diez padres y diez madres all encontrar siempre a los que fueron objeto de su afecto
5453334 ok drug test guy was major flirting and i had to hand him my cup of urine awkward
5453335 lol he was cute he said it was the same color as my sweater
5453336 he said your urine was the same color as your sweater
5453337 you dont comment on a girls urine nor do you compare it with her clothes
5453338 that is seriously one of the greatest things i have ever heard
5453339 both candidates agreed to the format of two consecutive interviews
5453340 agreed to and understood that in order to maintain a level playing field sen mccain wouldnt see or hear any of sen obamas appearance
5453341 he made sure there was no signal in that room
5453342 like there will be a tax question there will be an environment question he did not give them specific wording except on two questions and he did that because this forum was new ground and he didnt want them to be nervous he wanted them to be comfortable
5453343 so it was a level playing field except obama had the extra intel of that question
5453344 mr warren did not share with his audience of more than 2 200 in the church and millions watching and listening to the live television broadcasts radio programs and streaming on the internet that he had alerted the candidates to any of the questions in advance
5453345 you know full well that had obama gone second that his kronies would have been texting him the questions
5453346 the campaign of sen john mccain r ariz has assured the organizers
5453347 i tried to put my head against the wall to see if i could hear any of the answers
5453348 mccain didnt need to cheat so accusing him of cheating is stupid
5453349 the fact that barack obama would show up at an evangelical church and take the tough questions is a credit to him
5453350 never obamas fault he cannot answer questions without a script
5453351 if you really felt sorry for me youd let me eat your liver

5453353 were truly a vacation destination now were hoping with the opening of this hotel well bring more people to the bangor area because when they come here theyll shop and eat and dine at other locations and businesses around the area
5453354 whilst the mepa decision to restrict development in the buffer area around villa bologna is an improvement it does not address the basic issue that an area indicated for decades since 1965 as an area to be retained as undeveloped had its designation changed overnight without consultation when the local plan for the area was finalised
5453355 wir haben zu wenig nach vorne getan deshalb kann ich mit dem spiel nicht zufrieden sein

5453360 but when he saw the wind he was afraid and beginning to sink cried out lord save me
5453361 i love the lord for he heard my voice he heard my cry for mercy because he turned his ear to me i will call on him as long as i live
5453362 um everyones looking at you theyre probably like look at the one girl spinning around

5453366 people want fit for purpose content many businesses are in danger of being caught on the hop
5453367 if this ceasefire clause on pre 7 august positions is not applied quickly and in its entirety i will convoke an extraordinary council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5453368 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5453369 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5453370 we will have to determine if the russian intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response
5453371 in which case there will be inevitable consequences for its relations with the european union
5453372 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the eu
5453373 our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication
5453374 some of russias actions were not proportionate but it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame
5453375 we must stick to the partnership with russia even after these recent events which of course do not please us
5453376 bechtel ought to get the job its a natural for them given bechtels excellent performance on the jubilee line

5453381 i hope that by next year we will be back down to 60 to 80 a barrel
5453382 some in the west speak as if we are dealing with a limited local conflict
5453383 but thats a mistake if the strait of hormuz between the united arab emirates and iran were closed oil prices would be at 400 a barrel overnight

5453391 i want what i want right now because i deserve it and because im the most important person or obligation that you or anyone else on this planet has ever known and im going to bitch and whine and complain and threaten you if its not done when i want it done

5453393 the only difference between us and 1984 is we dress better
5453394 provided that the dalai lama renounces claims of independence and in particular exerts his influence to stop the present violent activities in tibet and acknowledges that tibet and taiwan are inseparable parts of china we can resume discussions with him
5453395 if the dalai lama genuinely relinquishes independent tibet claims and stops splitting the motherland especially stops inciting and planning the violent and illegal actions in tibet and thereby harming the beijing olympics and acknowledges that tibet and taiwan are inseparable parts of china we agree to continue discussions with him

5453401 having endpoint data leak protection technology alone is not sufficient to provide the maximum coverage for data leaks and reconnex had a unique value proposition with unique architecture complementary to our portfolio
5453402 we are going to grow the reconnex business and work very hard at integrating it not only with our host data leak protection technology but also with our epolicy orchestrator epo
5453403 we have a very successful formula here which we believe is repeatable integrating technologies quickly with epo and providing the maximum value to customers
5453404 one of the core things you do in data leak protection is you define what sensitive data you want to protect
5453405 so you have to define your data twice in completely different ways
5453406 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
5453407 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
5453408 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
5453409 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
5453410 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
5453411 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
5453412 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
5453413 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
5453414 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5453415 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
5453416 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
5453417 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
5453418 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
5453419 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
5453420 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving

5453426 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
5453427 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
5453428 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
5453429 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca

5453431 the copyright royalty board last year decided that the fee to play a music recording on web radio should step up from 8 100 of a cent per song per listener in 2006 to 19 100 of a cent per song per listener in 2010
5453432 soundexchange the organization that represents performers and record companies said it supports the higher royalties for internet radio because musicians deserve a bigger cut of internet radio profits
5453433 soundexchange officials argue that because different media have different profit margins it is appropriate to set different royalty rates

5453443 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
5453444 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5453445 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant
5453446 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5453447 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5453448 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5453449 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5453450 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5453451 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5453452 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5453453 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5453454 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5453455 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5453456 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5453457 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5453458 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5453459 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient

5453473 no matter how much the americans argue that nato is now focused on other threats for russia it remains an enemy force and no matter how often the americans say missile defense is aimed at iran and other so called rogue nations it remains an existential threat to russias aging and shrinking nuclear capability
5453474 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
5453475 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5453476 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5453477 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5453478 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5453479 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5453480 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5453481 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5453482 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5453483 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5453484 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5453485 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5453486 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5453487 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
5453488 bruce is the best coach for the galaxy and certainly one of the best coaches in the history of the league
5453489 and i said yeah i speak german like a native
5453490 there was a drug store i went in called the number and they said dean you stay outside and well pick you up in a staff car and they drove me up towards mount vernon and thats how i ended up at fort hunt it must have been end of november early december 1944
5453491 my job was to interrogate scientifically trained and experienced germans who had been sent to this country by the military
5453492 one of them was a person who worked on enriching uranium and i didnt know why anybody would want to enrich uranium i mean what does this have to do with anything
5453493 and so my job was to find out what he was doing and how it was being carried out and then i reported this to the pentagon
5453494 many of the archives were destroyed directly after the war and so if we didnt have the opportunity to speak with these men and capture their stories much of it may have been lost forever
5453495 there were a group of men sitting around a table in a room with great huge recorders recording everything these people said to each other
5453496 and so it sort of threw the prisoners off how did you know this how did you know that my daughter was 17 on march 28th so it really put them at a disadvantage
5453497 i was a pretty good athlete i would do sports with them in order to make them more cooperative i would take some of the people out for dinner at a restaurant in town in civilian clothes
5453498 it took quite some time before he was willing to cooperate the war had ended in europe and at that point he said hes willing to help us but his wife was at that point in what was in the russian zone
5453499 we told the sales person what size and so on and the woman held up a pair of panties
5453500 that should be long so as to cover their legs
5453501 for 63 years nobody ever said thank you and it was very nice to receive recognition that what we did was being recognized of being helpful to our country
5453502 yes we threatened them with being sent back to russia but there was no other personal harm of any kind and people thought they could be most effective as interrogators by being nice to the people they interrogated

5453506 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of a lot of the constitution
5453507 reasonable supreme court observers of all political stripes who do not necessarily agree with justice thomas jurisprudence consider his work to be scholarly and of top quality and yet senator obama is sadly unable to acknowledge even that much about an intelligent wonderful and kind man who broke racial barriers to rise to the very top of the legal profession
5453508 apparently obama can do no better than to recycle discredited statements of harry reid when it comes to justice thomas like other liberal elites obama cannot stand it when a black man strays from the ideological plantation and refuses to implement liberal policies through the courts but obama will never point out any intellectual deficiencies in justice thomass work because he cant justice thomass opinions consistently reveal faithfulness to the constitution judicial modesty and deference to the will of the people in our representative democracy that is opposed to everything that obama and the liberals are trying to do in grabbing power from the people and giving it to the courts

5453514 we didnt lose our confidence we had played west point a close game and that was encouraging
5453515 you would have thought our kids had just won the world series
5453516 the big difference this time against west point was we hit the ball good and got hits in clutch situations
5453517 before the game i just told the kids to go out and have fun and relax and they did they showed confidence and played really well
5453518 i was really excited about my bike 51 55 it was the second fastest for the women

5453543 shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
5453544 was not the bill that was presented at the state level
5453545 there is no way that the bill would have had any effect on any method of abortion
5453546 americans can differ on the issue of abortion but senator obamas extreme record on this issue and his willingness to misrepresent that record should concern any american who believes that we should be working towards a society where there are fewer abortions not more
5453547 seven times he had the opportunity to stand up against republican anti choice legislation in the illinois state senate
5453548 that in the medical judgment of the attending physician has a reasonable likelihood of resulting in a live born child shall be undertaken
5453549 protect the life of a child born alive as the result of an induced labor abortion
5453550 every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development
5453551 whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or other elements of the constitution
5453552 were saying they are persons entitled to the kinds of protections provided to a child a 9 month old child delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place
5453553 a physician inducing an abortion that results in a live born child
5453554 provide for the soonest practicable attendance of a physician other than the physician performing or inducing the abortion to immediately assess the childs viability and provide medical care for the child
5453555 all children who are born alive are entitled to equal protection under the law regardless of the circumstances surrounding the birth
5453556 this important legislation ensures that every infant born alive including an infant who survives an abortion procedure is considered a person under federal law
5453557 this reform was passed with the overwhelming support of both political parties and it is about to become the law of the land
5453558 committee and floor debate served to clarify the bills intent and assure us that it is not targeted at roe v wade or a womans right to choose
5453559 lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade
5453560 no longer will they call you deserted or name your land desolate but you will be called hephzibah and your land beulah for the lord will take delight in you atheism as her feelings of emptiness continued to grow after living in poverty with her mother and continuing on to live more wealthy with her grandparents she felt dissatisfied with life its funny cause i kind of had the two extremes i was really poor and then i went to live with my grandma who was really rich i remember thinking is this it is this all life has to offer and if it is im not satisfied with it and i dont believe what the world has to offer you is enough
5453561 i never knew my dad but this really did catch my attention because this man at the church didnt know me and the more he kept saying about pain the more my heart broke into a million pieces finally when i was more desperate than id ever been he asked if i wanted to pray and i said yes i had my head in my hands and he prayed for gods peace to come over me jesus saved me and it was the most awesome freedom ive ever known it was then and there that god gave me the begining of a new life
5453562 unless you change how you teach and how kids work new technology is not really going to make a difference
5453563 theres a lot of ownership by the kids in their work instead of teachers lecturing and being the givers of all knowledge
5453564 the classes are just much more alive they dont sleep in class
5453565 its caught fire in indiana and weve got to have this kind of education to prepare our young people for the future in a global economy that is immersed in technology

5453572 if to talk to oneself when alone is folly it must be doubly unwise to listen to oneself in the presence of others
5453573 he says smith adds that when teachers correct spelling they waste valuable time they could be spending on bigger ideas
5453574 the real weakness of his as i see it is that he has never realized the importance of institutions
5453575 he just leaves all the institutions of pakistan so weak including the political ones who are to now run the affairs of the country
5453576 onward his standing was on shaky grounds and the power began to slip away from him
5453577 musharraf was a hotheaded and impulsive political leader from day 1 to the end
5453578 this was very unfortunate that he always put his personal ambitions ahead of the interests of the people of pakistan
5453579 for the last years he has been ruling the country and hes been no good to it
5453580 so i think it is better that he has resigned and its over now
5453581 the critical choice to join the fight against al qaeda the taliban and other extremist groups
5453582 the united states supported the transition to democratic government in pakistan
5453583 partly because the u s stayed in visible support of musharraf even after it became clear that the voters had rejected him
5453584 shut up and do absolutely nothing but respond to initiatives from the new government
5453585 the central terrorist threat to the united states lies in northwest pakistan and afghanistan and not iraq
5453586 se debe adoptar pol tica p blica que fomente el valor del trabajo y desaliente la dependencia en la beneficencia social
5453587 la pobreza implica opresi n dependencia injusticia y es por lo tanto un hecho generado y mantenido por unas estructuras por lo que no es posible resolverla sin trabajar con ellas esta realidad hay que examinarla en el contexto de un sistema contributivo que impone la carga contributiva en la clase media
5453588 desde el punto de vista de productividad y mercado de empleo donde todos saben hacer lo mismo el trabajo vale muy poco la competencia por un empleo es feroz desaparecen las oportunidades y s lo queda como opci n el gobierno

5453602 i dont think we could have blown up the bubble that fast in kirkland
5453603 our attention to detail i dont think is very good right now
5453604 there is a trickle down affect here so i start with my coaching staff and hopefully they listen and carry it on to the to the players
5453605 i feel worse than i did right after the game
5453606 we played a horribly sloppy game horribly sloppy you gain 500 yards and the other team gains 200 and youre in an overtime game how does that compute
5453607 well it computes because you had six turnovers 12 penalties you got a couple of blocked punts i mean it was horrible i wont stand for it it was too much of a playground the other night
5453608 charlie falls in the other category right after the game i was not very happy with charlie then i looked at the film and charlie got hit a lot that coupled with the fact it was his first start for us and theres a lot of new stuff weve thrown at him charlie is a tough guy i was actually proud of the way he hung in there
5453609 of all the guys up front he was as consistent as anyone we had
5453610 i see what you see but he has to feel like hes ready to play and were not there yet
5453611 there is a bit of russian in all of us
5453612 the hope is so high that it will have some effect that everybodys asking for it
5453613 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
5453614 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5453615 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant
5453616 the surgery went as planned and annie is now recuperating at home
5453617 annie would like to send her thanks and appreciation to all that have sent their well wishes in the past few days
5453618 i should have been attending the final press blitz of the week but my back suddenly went into spasm last night giving me more pain than ive ever experienced in my life and a totally numb left foot
5453619 a very nice doctor from cancun had given my aching vertebra some adjustments and a great big which should help me to get to the airport tonight im gutted of course because i was really primed up to attend the media event but at this point in time im actually having difficulty getting out of bed
5453620 i came back to the u k and got wheeled off the plane a first i must say felt a bit like elizabeth taylor got an mri scan this morning and am now sitting up in bed with my left foot like a dead fish freezing and numb im going to have to get myself a crutch and a parrot so i can fob myself off as a pirate
5453621 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5453622 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5453623 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5453624 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5453625 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5453626 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient
5453627 the mom was playing religious tapes in the room and obviously was very focused on looking for a miracle
5453628 caught her in the side of the head she had no pulse when they pulled her out of the water
5453629 we just cant shut that machine off then you know what we cant shut that machine off
5453630 if its only one day and then its cool afterwards its not a problem
5453631 but usually these heat waves last for some days and it becomes a health problem
5453632 what im personally very concerned about is the middle east and northern india its a heavily populated area and its already very hot there today but it will become much hotter there so they will experience temperatures that will reach up to 125 degrees fahrenheit
5453633 there its not very easy for people to turn on the air conditioning or to pick up and move just because they dont have as many resources
5453634 my preliminary research on india suggests that the impacts on mortality could be quite dramatic
5453635 i think its becoming clearer and clearer that the costs of climate change wont be spread evenly around the globe unfortunately theyre going to be concentrated in countries least able to deal with them just due to low income levels
5453636 changes in temperature are not going to accrue overnight so there will be a lot of time to adapt
5453637 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response
5453638 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5453639 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5453640 theres too many variables going on to find the right open water to train in
5453641 its either too cold its too warm its too wavy its not safe theres a lot of things living in a lot of bodies of water that you dont want to mess with why take those risks and pools are easy to train in
5453642 in open water races sometimes a hundredth of a second does separate first from second
5453643 but the only difference is that weve been racing for an hour and 50 something minutes so its as intense as pool races its just it doesnt get that intense until the very end
5453644 a couple of years ago i was racing against him and it just kinda dawned on me during the race that there was no chance i was gonna beat this guy and so i said if you cant beat him find a race that he wont swim and that was probably the genesis of realizing that i needed to do something besides pool swimming
5453645 we think of open water as like the english channel open
5453646 and you think of pacific and atlantic ocean and its not like that its very tight very compressed yeah you swim a 10k and theres no lane lines but my goodness you are breathing each others air and ill probably end up with a black eye because youll get kicked in the face or something like that so its a crowded elevator is what it is
5453647 just nobody knows about it its a subculture of a subculture its finally getting its first due in the olympic games
5453648 democrats because weve burned in the last few elections get nervous and skittish right around this time
5453649 just kind of sprung full bore out of the guys head
5453650 just days before the start of the democratic convention in denver which will culminate in the crowning of barack obama are we in fact seeing the early outlines of a first rate political cover up

5453679 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5453680 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
5453681 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
5453682 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5453683 because of the great emphasis on harmony and family integration in many asian cultures family conflict is an important factor to consider when studying suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5453684 our study suggests that we need to more precisely determine the kinds of family conflicts that are associated with suicide risk among asian americans and find means of preventing these family problems
5453685 this is the first nationally representative investigation of family conflict and suicidal behaviors among asian americans
5453686 our findings suggest that high family conflict has an independent and additive effect in predicting lifetime suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among asian americans
5453687 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5453688 i did not resign because i was guilty of anything
5453689 i resigned because i was told that was the only way to get a letter that says i didnt do it

5453692 men who underwent tonsillectomy alone bled significantly more than women 11 2 percent and 5 4 percent respectively
5453693 further investigation of this relationship is needed with stratification of patients by the number of cigarettes smoked and attention to the length of time before and or after surgery that patients refrain from smoking

5453699 if we were younger all wed talk about is sex and hot guys
5453700 now all we talk about is food and our many ailments
5453701 victims are unknown to them prior to the injury event and the clinicians frequently need to make rapid life and death decisions with little time to determine victims values and preferences for care
5453702 the findings of the surveys pose challenges for trauma professionals hospital administrators insurers and society as a whole
5453703 issues need to be discussed in the clinical and public arenas and within the curricula of health professional education rich and sensitive dialogue is needed so that all dying trauma patients and their families receive quality end of life care
5453704 reducing the psychosocial impact of acne is considered one of the guiding principles for its clinical management and it is important to measure and evaluate this impact
5453705 knowledge of these patient preferences may help dermatologists balance clinical trial results with patients expectations of therapy
5453706 randomized blinded placebo controlled trials have shown that three to four months of conventional acne therapy including topical benzoyl peroxide topical retinoids and oral antibiotics typically produces reductions in lesion counts in the 40 percent to 60 percent range
5453707 it has also been suggested that the incidence of scarring from facial acne approaches 95 percent
5453708 thus adolescents marked preference for total clearance over partial 50 percent clearance or clearance with scarring suggests that physicians must weigh high patient expectations against these clinical data regarding efficacy and risk of sequelae
5453709 dermatologists are keenly aware of the ways skin diseases may have a substantial impact on a patients overall quality of life
5453710 however in an environment in which health expenditures are allocated by non physicians it is critical to demonstrate the burden of skin disease relative to non dermatologic disease to funding sources government agencies and the lay public
5453711 in terms of social value preference weighted questionnaires are instrumental in evaluating the extent to which increased health care expenditures lead to patient benefits because they incorporate a summary description of health status social values and life expectancy
5453712 fundamentally utilities measure true patient preferences uninhibited by physician assumptions such measurement refocuses physicians on the primary goal of our profession improving the care of our patients
5453713 evidence based clinical practice guidelines strongly recommend that elderly trauma patients be treated as aggressively as non elderly patients
5453714 however some studies have suggested that age bias may still exist in trauma care even in the prehospital phase of that care
5453715 the problem of age bias raised in this study may negate efforts to improve clinical care for elderly trauma patients within trauma centers if the system as a whole does not function properly and deliver patients appropriately to needed resources
5453716 however it may be difficult to change attitudes of age bias and may require a broad societal campaign nevertheless it may be possible to address this problem without directly addressing age bias a focus on retraining the providers about triage protocols may be sufficient
5453717 additionally it may be helpful to highlight the literature that now suggests that elderly trauma patients do in fact return to productive lives after their injury which can eliminate the perception of futility of care that may be used consciously or subconsciously to justify age bias
5453718 the tracking system is deployed and working which is great news
5453719 we started ultrasonic tagging programs in maine in 1997 and have learned much about salmon ecology in the estuaries and bays of the gulf of maine
5453720 our team is really excited that fish from our most recent work in the penobscot river have been detected so far along on their migration northward the first data provided valuable information about how long it took atlantic salmon from the penobscot river to reach halifax
5453721 given the fact that we are looking for a fish that is still less than a foot long that could be anywhere in the northwest atlantic ocean finding them in such apparent concentrations hundreds of miles from brewer maine is remarkable and very encouraging
5453722 broad scale ocean arrays such as the halifax array are a great tool to examine the marine ecology of such an uncommon fish in a large marine environment
5453723 we have three scientists in the labrador sea right now working with canadian colleagues as part of the international salmon at sea salsea project to determine where atlantic salmon are and are not and to try to get detailed genetic and dietary information about the various north atlantic salmon stocks
5453724 atlantic salmon are an iconic fish but theyre endangered and people want to know whats happening to the population
5453725 this is the first step to finding out where the salmon are dying and whats causing the decline
5453726 postoperative ileus inability of the intestines to pass contents is regarded as an inevitable response to the trauma of abdominal surgery and is a major contributing factor to postoperative pain and discomfort associated with abdominal distension nausea vomiting and cramping pain
5453727 postoperative length of hospital stay was assessed in four trials comprising 134 patients
5453728 this was also reduced in the chewing gum group by longer than one day however this result was not statistically significant
5453729 in conclusion we feel that the current evidence suggests that gum chewing following abdominal surgery offers significant benefits in reducing the time to resolution of ileus however the studies are insufficiently powered to identify a significant benefit in length of stay
5453730 the potential benefits to individual patients in health economics terms are such that a well designed large scale blinded randomized controlled trial with a placebo arm is warranted to answer the question of whether gum chewing can significantly reduce the length of stay after abdominal surgery or whether it merely represents a placebo effect
5453731 our study underscores the high rate of poor quality and inadequate sleep in adolescence coupled with the risk of developing high blood pressure and other health problems
5453732 we also found that a low sleep efficiency may be more consistently associated with pre hypertension than a shorter sleep period
5453733 although the overall frequency of sleep insufficiency in children is unknown our studys prevalence of 26 percent may be under estimated due to the exclusion of children with known sleep disorders and other illnesses
5453734 part of the problem is the technological invasion of the bedroom with computers cell phones and music
5453735 there are teens who text message or listen to music all night compounded by early school hours adolescents need nine hours of sleep parents should optimize sleep quality for their family with regular sleep and wake times and bedrooms should be kept quiet dark and conducive to sleep
5453736 these groups already are known to be at higher risk for hypertension and other adverse outcomes
5453737 their high prevalence of poor sleep quality and deprivation could be due to disruptive home environments and neighborhoods as well as unrecognized psychological and medical problems
5453738 meanwhile pediatricians should view sleep quality and patterns as an intervenable health concern
5453739 our data underscores the need to monitor quality and quantity of sleep as part of a childs overall health strategy

5453743 it is important that people with epilepsy and their caregivers take steps to prevent these tragedies
5453744 people with active epilepsy should shower instead of bathe take medication regularly to control seizures and should have direct supervision when swimming
5453745 we want to make sure that all the information our voters need is readily available
5453746 local election offices have procedures in place so only one ballot would count
5453747 were working with the election assistance commission to try to make sure that the data is as sound as possible for the 2008 election as well as to be sure our numbers are sound so that as we go forward we have the best information possible to continue to make improvements

5453759 in hollywood there is a huge surplus of talent that doesnt get its output through the hollywood bottleneck theres only about 700 movies made in one year but in los angeles alone there are more than 100 000 actors and theres no room for all of them in the movies

5453763 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5453764 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5453765 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5453766 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be

5453812 no monthly return would be required regarding the meeting with the deputy minister
5453813 in this case the consultant lobbyist is not expected to and should not report it
5453814 however the corporation or association who participated in the meeting is required to report it via their corporate or organizations lobbying registration
5453815 if he or she is required to register as a lobbyist under the act
5453816 any reasonable person would consider what you described to be a reportable activity under the act
5453817 i dont remember it being discussed because who could conceive of something so ridiculous
5453818 one of the unique ways ibm research stays ahead of the competition is by looking at innovations that will have a real world impact
5453819 now through our collaborative model we are helping the it market explore new growth opportunities enabled by our state of the art speech technologies and solutions
5453820 speech is becoming increasingly equivalent to text due to decades of research investment such as that of ibm research improved performance and tools for interpreting the resulting text are driving rapid growth for example of speech as an interface to mobile phones
5453821 one particularly effective approach is the voice search model just say what you want and get it to shorten transactions transcription of voicemail and call center conversations to text makes it possible to quickly search and analyze the result creating new growth and flexibility in unified communications and customer service analytics
5453822 we are working at the ultimate edge of what is possible progressing toward advanced next generation semiconductor technologies
5453823 this new development is a critical achievement in the pursuit to continually drive miniaturization in microelectronics
5453824 a year ago i advocated that the u s move from a musharraf policy to a pakistan policy i hope all of pakistans friends will now seize the opportunity created by musharrafs exit to focus on the urgent issues of today confronting the threat of extremist violence dealing with food and energy shortages and helping the pakistani people build a stable secure democratic future
5453825 the situation in pakistans frontier regions requires immediate and continued attention and i hope that the elections for president musharrafs successor will serve to reconcile the pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally it is critical that the united states continue to work in partnership with the pakistani people and their democratically elected government to tackle the many challenges we both face

5453828 but with the spot paintings ive realized im doing 1 1 2 millimeter dots and one painting 7 foot square will take me 20 years so i figure i can do that for the rest of my life
5453829 the spots are going to stay im going to carry on doing those the butterflies are going to stop im going to stop the spins and with the formaldehydes there are just a few works i want to make
5453830 to add stronger more prominent warnings in the product label
5453831 at noon the collective sigh of the chinese people became a hurricane which attacked chinese sports heavily in one minute the whole country lost its breath in that moment
5453832 yao ming is just as famous but nobody expects him to win a gold medal

5453837 we knew that we wanted to go around them on the outside that was our game plan going in and im glad that we found that eventually
5453838 i liked chalupny very much during the world cup at center mid
5453839 the thing is shes a quality defender shes two footed and she can beat players the way we play having the outside backs going forward we need that kind of player
5453840 i love playing out of the back and facing the whole field
5453841 the way we play sundhage encourages me to get forward and get into the attack even more and more and more its really fun to play there im enjoying it
5453842 almost an entire half of the entire venue was taken up with reserved seats for every gold medal michael phelps swam there were hundreds and hundreds of empty seats in these areas
5453843 historically they have been too big and we need to really push hard at changing the traditional size of these areas and to shrink them and expand the number of seats we can sell to the public
5453844 i think given the experience here in beijing we are going to find we have some support in doing that
5453845 the one i would say i am not satisfied with yet is the press every seat at a table that a press person takes is three seats that spectators could sit in i think they are far too big and unnecessary for a lot of people
5453846 we know the demand for winter sport in our city is going to be beyond what it has ever been for a winter games and were willing to put in that effort and that fight to free up as many seats as we can

5453863 we would like to be a part of it from day one
5453864 it will be another tool to open up investment in this community
5453865 this is the start of a discussion that will get broader in the community
5453866 it would certainly allow for our transportation and highway systems to be supplemented and would reduce cars on the roadway
5453867 the challenge will be to make it efficient and build it in a way thats patterned after normal business practices
5453868 being unwanted unloved uncared for forgotten by everybody i think that is a much greater hunger a much greater poverty than the person who has nothing to eat we must find each other

5453885 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5453886 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5453887 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5453888 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud
5453889 microsoft has other online perhaps cloud services such as its live services and new live mesh service for synchronizing devices of every kind it is also testing a consumer version of office that will combine a basic version of desktop office with an array of online services
5453890 last friday i spoke with workday a saas erp company ive been tracking since its start
5453891 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5453892 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5453893 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5453894 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5453895 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5453896 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5453897 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5453898 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5453899 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice

5453902 if a fly falls in the vessel of any of you let him dip all of it into the vessel and then throw it away for in one of its wings there is a disease and in the other there is healing antidote for it i e the treatment for that disease
5453903 you have shown that you are a very dangerous individual indeed i consider that you pose a very significant risk to the public and you are a dangerous offender
5453904 given to him by oink37 and bestows it upon cyress8 you
5453905 you dont just create an audience in this business you create a kind of community
5453906 and i need to be able to talk to this community about this and to try to assuage what i suspect will be frustration and anger at losing a voice that they felt spoke for them
5453907 simply living time after time getting a new body eventually losing it and getting a new one
5453908 the trial is proceeding we feel really good about our claims and were hopeful that justice will be done

5453912 there are bad storms and there are nice ones and this is a nice one
5453913 it cleans out all the trees it gives people a little work to do and it gets the tourists out of here for a few days
5453914 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5453915 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5453916 ive got a generator and ive got a concrete home that i built myself so i know it can withstand this
5453917 every hurricane that we have we have additional lessons learned and experience
5453918 this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall

5453931 canadas first adult video channel offering significant canadian adult content
5453932 i think as canadians there is a bit of a tiredness in seeing all american stuff
5453933 there is always that thrill for something that is local and you get the sense that these are people you can meet at the supermarket
5453934 not less than 50 percent of the broadcast day and not less than 50 percent of the evening broadcast period to canadian programming
5453935 we want to be canadas adult channel and i think to do that 15 percent wouldnt cut it
5453936 we continue to be adequately capitalized and we are committed to raising additional capital were financially sound and have strong liquidity

5453939 i dont think mccain actually lives up to any of the claims he makes for himself but that is not the political point
5453940 about faith mccain goes to the vietnamese torture a guy came in at one point a guard came in then motioned him to stay quiet then loosened the ropes tying him he came back later to tighten them one day outside that same guard came next to mccain and drew a cross in the ground then quickly rubbed it out at that one moment there were just two christians

5454060 im just gonna grab something from the corner store hon need anything
5454061 this is another example of the enemies of afghanistans complete disregard for the people of afghanistan and the rule of law i strongly condemn this callous and heartless attack on the people of afghanistan on this highly significant day of national celebration
5454062 my resolve and that of the international community remain unwavering in our efforts to support the government of afghanistan and the people of afghanistan in bringing peace and security to their nation
5454063 for 10 of the last 11 weeks weve sustained less than 200 attacks per week nationwide
5454064 it is undeniable that iraq is in a much better place than it was several months ago
5454065 an increasingly effective iraqi security force one that is growing in capability and in confidence
5454066 and as a result we have seen signs of hope and prosperity return to many parts of the country that were once previously threatened by criminals and terrorists and others who dont want iraq to achieve its full potential
5454067 were making progress in each of these areas every day
5454068 and while these efforts are progressing at a different pace they all are moving forward in a positive and tangible manner
5454069 today the multinational corps iraq is operating in more areas of the country with fewer troops and our security gains continue to trend in a positive direction even after the redeployment of five brigade combat teams and most recently the georgia brigade
5454070 in the north al qaida is in disarray and its capability to conduct well planned and coordinated attacks is limited but they still pose a real threat to the population
5454071 and a couple of weeks ago i walked through an open market in mosul that was several kilometers long and it was overflowing with iraqis
5454072 now thats something that would not have been possible just a couple of months ago and this is a clear sign that we are making progress indeed
5454073 suicide vests which are a trademark of al qaida account for less than 3 percent of the total number of all of attacks but they account for 65 percent of all casualties
5454074 so you can see that while al qaida is in disarray they are still capable of ruthless attacks
5454075 as a result of the improved security in places like basra and amarah were seeing fewer numbers of lethal accelerants making their way into baghdad
5454076 today these militias are largely disrupted and ineffective because of iraqi operations and because the people have turned against them
5454077 absolutely impressed with the commitment and the professionalism of our soldiers sailors airmen and marines
5454078 their hard work continues to have a positive impact on the lives of the iraqis
5454079 theres still much work to be done but were making steady progress every day
5454080 its important for the people of florida to know the citizen soldiers and airmen of the florida national guard are prepared to respond to tropical storm fay as assigned by the florida division of emergency management
5454081 the national guard is poised to provide humanitarian aid security equipment debris removal and search and rescue assistance
5454082 the guard has continuous contact and coordination in effect with the florida division of emergency management in tallahassee and has established planning cells to ensure a rapid build up of personnel and equipment if needed
5454083 we have much experience in responding to emergencies and we will continue to rise to the occasion
5454084 the army was interested in combining training exercises for its dive team with public service projects and contacted us about efforts in puget sound
5454085 we were already making plans for the tire removal and excited to take them up on the offer
5454086 this is a great cooperative project and wdfw is very appreciative of the skills labor and funding provided by these partners
5454087 cleaning up puget sound is an immense task and more successes will be possible through joint efforts such as these
5454088 the pass is one of many areas that contain discarded fishing gear nets and abandoned shrimp and crab pots that are posing significant threats to the marine resources in puget sound
5454089 we mixed up the lineup and had some nice combinations and i was pleased to see us score goals

5454101 da gibt es keines au er vielleicht die der produktionssteigerung durch motivationssch be

5454117 the world burns such lovely crimson its a shame my message dies with those ashes
5454118 it seems you can survive outside this dead world this burning town
5454119 even if i survive im just a fragment a ghost you you are a guardian you carry the burdens of all who live here who lived here you can lighten their loads when you see fit you carry the messages of those who have lived before to those who will live after
5454120 this new city is young beautiful the old is dead and burnt to ashes now you you carry in you those ashes its a tragedy that this world is in for such hard times
5454121 let the dead rest but never forget their spirit their memory
5454122 their messages their memory their spirit that is their only tie to those who need help you are a pillar of light to those lost in their own darkness
5454123 guide them to you and aid them its for the better but be wary for even the meekest of souls can devour the lights of a guardian
5454124 industria was burning its burned now to ashes go and scatter my ashes eternal sentinel
5454125 god speed my eternal love god speed to all youre after
5454126 this world is burnt down i must go and scatter the ashes let the dead rest and the broken lay forever

5454144 i contend that we are both atheists i just believe in one fewer god than you do when you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods you will understand why i dismiss yours
5454145 calling atheism a religion is like calling bald a hair color
5454146 an atheist is a man who has no invisible means of support
5454147 no philosophy no religion has ever brought so glad a message to the world as this good news of atheism
5454148 it is said that men may not be the dreams of the gods but rather that the gods are the dreams of men
5454149 it may be that our role on this planet is not to worship god but to create him
5454150 i distrust those people who know so well what god wants them to do because i notice it always coincides with their own desires
5454151 is god willing to prevent evil but not able then he is not omnipotent is he able but not willing then he is malevolent is he both able and willing then whence cometh evil is he neither able nor willing then why call him god
5454152 god is not dead he is alive and working on a much less ambitious project
5454153 dont you know there aint no devil its just god when hes drunk
5454154 if it turns out that there is a god i dont think that hes evil but the worst that you can say about him is that basically hes an underachiever
5454155 religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature the heart of a heartless world amp the soul of soulless conditions it is the opium of the people
5454156 organized religion is a sham and a crutch for weak minded people
5454157 humanity without religion is like a serial killer without a chainsaw
5454158 we must respect the other fellows religion but only in the sense and to the extent that we respect his theory that his wife is beautiful and his children smart
5454159 men never commit evil so fully and joyfuly as when they do it for religious convictions
5454160 the way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason
5454161 the church says the earth is flat but i know that it is round for i have seen the shadow on the moon and i have more faith in a shadow than in the church
5454162 the fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one
5454163 and if there were a god i think it very unlikely that he would have such an uneasy vanity as to be offended by those who doubt his existence
5454164 creationists make it sound like a theory is something you dreamt up after being drunk all night
5454165 gods are fragile things they may be killed by a whiff of science or a dose of common sense
5454166 in christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point
5454167 of all religions the christian is without doubt the one which should inspire tolerance most although up to now the christians have been the most intolerant of all men
5454168 i still say a church steeple with a lightening rod on top shows a lack of confidence
5454169 it aint the parts of the bible that i cant understand that bother me it is the parts that i do understand
5454170 no man ever believes that the bible means what it says he is always convinced that it says what he means
5454171 the good part of christmas is not always christian it is generally pagan that is to say human natural
5454172 the first clergyman was the first rascal who met the first fool
5454173 men will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest
5454174 why should i allow that same god to tell me how to raise my kids who had to drown his own
5454175 philosophy is questions that may never be answered religion is answers that may never be questioned
5454176 the philosopher has never killed any priests whereas the priest has killed a great many philosophers
5454177 as people become more intelligent they care less for preaches and more for teachers
5454178 the world holds two classes of men intelligent men without religion and religious men without intelligence
5454179 question with boldness even the existence of god because if there be one he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear
5454180 history i believe furnishes no example of a priest ridden people maintaining a free civil government
5454181 in no instance have the churches been guardians of the liberties of the people
5454182 the divinity of jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity
5454183 the number the industry and the morality of the priesthood and the devotion of the people have been manifestly increased by the total separation of the church from the state james madison
5454184 every new and successful example therefore of a perfect separation between the ecclesiastical and civil matters is of importance and i have no doubt that every new example will succeed as every past one has done in showing that religion and government will both exist in greater purity the less they are mixed together
5454185 leave the matter of religion to the family altar the church and the private schools supported entirely by private contributions keep the church and the state forever separated
5454186 in god we trust i dont believe it would sound any better if it were true
5454187 the trouble with theocracy is that everyone wants to be theo
5454188 anger leads to hate hate leads to the dark side
5454189 the idea that there are several points of view all equally worthy of merit even when they are perhaps contradictory seems like a reasonable compromise to some but infact its really quite pretentious relativism is would appear is spreading partly to placate multi culturalism but there is really something special about scientific evidence planes fly magic carpets and brooms do not anyone who questions the existence of gravity is invited to take a jump out of the nearest 10 storey window
5454190 i offer my unconditional love to you i love you without needing to receive anything in return

5454296 were all in this together and the people of pakistan and the government of pakistan know that
5454297 so were confident that while we certainly all have more to do when it comes to fighting terrorism the government of pakistan will continue in the effort
5454298 while this political process is under way we certainly expect theyll keep up their fight against terrorists and extremists and because of what i just said this is a fight that they are in as well
5454299 thats what the prime minister said when he was in washington
5454300 president bush is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5454301 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5454302 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5454303 the extremist ideology is one that has been out there and among these groups for many years
5454304 lets be very clear about where this started and thats with the extremists
5454305 a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5454306 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism

5454327 we are seeing evidence of ss 21 missiles in south ossetia
5454328 but let me be clear if it rolled in after august 6th it needs to roll out
5454329 that would be in keeping with the russian commitment on withdrawal
5454330 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of the ceasefire and should be removed immediately
5454331 the only forces that are permitted to remain under the ceasefire agreement are the forces that were in there at the august 6th timeframe
5454332 were seeing them solidify their positions in south ossetia and abkhazia
5454333 i cant say whether they are actually moving people out right now or not but we do expect them to start moving out we expect them to move out slowly so this may take some time
5454334 when we received news of the first two ss 21 russian missile launchers into georgian territory

5454341 the russian side is gravely violating the conditions provided for by the peace accord signed by the presidents of georgia france and the russian federation
5454342 persistent delay in the withdrawal of its forces from georgia

5454439 sag mir dass du dich an diesem tag furchtbar schlecht gef hlt hast und diese sechs nichts weiter als ein ausdruck deiner k rperlichen verfassung ist ich glaube n mlich nicht daran dass meine beste sch lerin sich derma en verschlechtern kann in nur vier wochen
5454440 julie du l ufst seit einer woche herum als h tte ein riesiger komet einen krater in dein leben geschmettert ich wei dass junge frauen oftmals probleme haben aber du solltest dich nicht davor scheuen mit mir zu reden ich war auch einmal so alt wie du
5454441 na gut ich verstehe wenn du es f r dich behalten m chtest aber wenn du in der n chsten arbeit wieder eine sechs schreibst werden wir wohl oder bel miteinander reden m ssen und mit deinen eltern
5454442 bist du verr ckt wie kannst du es ihr erz hlen wei t du eigentlich was das hei t du musst verr ckt sein
5454443 aber sie ist war f r mich da seit der grundschule ich dachte ich kenne sie
5454444 und du hast dich get uscht bei so was musst du doch aufpassen du kannst es doch nicht jedem x beliebigen auf die nase binden wenn wir auffliegen was denkst du was dann passiert es wird ger chte geben die sich verbreiten wir werden schief angesehen die anderen werden bemerkungen von sich geben sie werden sich nicht mehr mit uns in einer umkleide umziehen wollen die lehrer werden es mitbekommen sie werden mit uns sprechen wollen mit unseren eltern und wenn die es erfahren kannst du es sowieso vergessen
5454445 sie wird uns nicht verraten sie hat erkl rt dass sie mit menschen wie uns nichts zu tun haben will und du glaubst sie wird es nicht jedem verraten der es wissen will du bist vollkommen naiv
5454446 julie kann nicht damit umgehen aber sie w rde mir niemals so etwas antun
5454447 julie mein gott du schwitzt ja was ist denn los sag doch etwas
5454448 lass uns nicht warten bis zur n chsten sechs bis zu einem gespr ch mit deinen eltern sag mir was los ist
5454449 glauben sie dass jemand mit sechzehn jahren ganz genau wei was er tut
5454450 es kommt sicherlich darauf an was du meinst nicht in allen lebensbereichen sind jugendliche dazu f hig schon ganz ber ihre handlungen reflektieren zu k nnen aber auch vielen erwachsenen fehlt diese gabe und in manchen bereichen sind junge menschen auch ehrlicher zu sich selbst als erwachsene
5454451 wenn ihnen jemand sagen w rde in diesem alter dass
5454452 julie ich wei doch wen du meinst glaubst du ernsthaft dass ich mit blindheit geschlagen bin
5454453 eher durch zufall wir sind uns einmal bei einem treffen im stadtzentrum bei der psychologischen beratungsstelle wo ich ehrenamtlich arbeite begegnet es war f r sie ebenso schwer es auszusprechen wie f r dich aber erz hl mir wie du es erfahren hast
5454454 sie wissen doch dass wir schon lange befreundet sind seit der vierten klasse michi hatte die schule wechseln m ssen weil ihre mutter umgezogen war sie hat es nicht leicht gehabt wir waren eine eingeschworene gemeinschaft sie war furchtbar allein an einem nachmittag als ich gerade nach hause laufen wollte habe ich sie gesehen wie sie bei dem kleinen fluss hinter der sporthalle gestanden hat mit den f en im wasser mitten im winter das wasser war eiskalt stellenweise sogar gefroren das m ssen sie sich mal vorstellen
5454455 du hast sie ge rgert hast gesagt dass sie doch bl d sei mit den nackten f en ins eiskalte wasser zu gehen du hast gemeint dass sie sich ganz sicher eine lungenentz ndung holen w rde und sie meinte dass ihr das egal sei weil sie gar nicht mehr leben wolle niemand mochte sie mehr ihr vater war weggegangen ihre mutter k mmerte sich um den neuen job und keiner in der schule konnte sie leiden
5454456 sie hat mir auch von eurer ersten begegnung erz hlt
5454457 ja hat sie ihnen auch gesagt dass sie mich mit dem eiskalten wasser von oben bis unten voll gespritzt hat
5454458 das hat sie und sie hat gelacht bis ihr die tr nen kamen aber sie hatte auch allen grund ich habe geh rt dass du sie mit schnee beworfen und sie beleidigt hast sie wusste damals nicht dass es nur ein man ver war um ihr zu helfen aber heute ist es ihr klar sie wei dass du sie necken und ihr helfen wolltest
5454459 wollte ich am anfang gar nicht ich fand es wirklich ziemlich doof wie sie da im fluss stand aber als sie mir von ihrem vater erz hlt hat und dass sie so allein war das tat mir irgendwie leid das resultat daraus war dass wir am n chsten tag beide erk ltet in die schule kamen aber von da an alles gemeinsam gemacht haben
5454460 ich wei eure m tter sind sogar zusammen in meine sprechstunde gekommen und wollten daf r sorgen dass ihr zusammen bleibt michis mutter war der meinung dass es f r ihre tochter furchtbar w re dich wieder zu verlieren wo ihr euch gerade erst n her kennen gelernt hattet aber ich konnte damals nichts tun deshalb wurdet ihr auf unterschiedliche klassen verteilt
5454461 das war f r michi ganz furchtbar es war irgendwie seltsam nicht mehr mit ihr gemeinsam im unterricht zu sitzen aber wir hatten zeitgleich schule aus wir hatten fast dieselben lehrer wir konnten uns mit den klausuren absprechen
5454462 ja das hat sie und das alles nur wegen dieser fixen idee die sie sich in den kopf gesetzt hat
5454463 nat rlich sie hat sich in ein m dchen verliebt so ein unsinn noch dazu in eine ltere sch lerin das hat sie doch nur aus diesen komischen japanischen comics die sie viel zu oft liest das ist doch alles gro er m ll
5454464 meinst du vielleicht haben ihr diese comics nur offenbart was sie schon lange gef hlt hat michi hat mir zumindest erz hlt dass sie schon vor etwa vier jahren angefangen hat sich dar ber gedanken zu machen
5454465 vor vier jahren aber sie hat nie mit mir dar ber geredet
5454466 julie ihr wart zw lf in diesem alter sprechen m dchen gew hnlich davon wie sie sich das erste mal verlieben aber in einen jungen in deiner klasse war das doch nicht anders ich wei noch wie die m dchen verr ckt gespielt haben als dieser neue referendar an unsere schule kam das ist ganz normal in der pubert t aber f r michi war das nicht normal sie hat damals gemerkt dass sie nicht empfindet wie die anderen m dchen du bist zwar ihre freundin aber ich bin sicher dass sie sich erst einmal selbst dar ber im klaren werden wollte was bei ihr passiert
5454467 sicher schief gelaufen sie glaubt dass sie frauen mag normal kann das ja wohl nicht sein
5454468 wie kommst du zu der annahme dass es nicht normal ist wenn frauen sich in frauen verlieben
5454469 weil frauen eben zu m nnern geh ren und m nner zu frauen das ist nun einmal so
5454470 gut ich gebe dir recht es ist die norm dass frauen sich in m nner verlieben und umgekehrt aber die norm ist nicht gleichzusetzen mit normalit t normalit t ist das nat rliche das was von der natur aus geschaffen wurde und die natur sorgt daf r dass wir menschen uns unterschiedlich entwickeln bei unserer erzeugung unserer entwicklung laufen so viele prozesse ab die sich bei jedem menschen unterschiedlich gestalten sie sind sich in groben z gen hnlich aber bei diesen prozessen passiert soviel dass die verschiedensten ergebnisse heraus kommen k nnen so dass niemals ein individuum dem anderen gleichen wird das ist die natur und das ist wunderbar findest du nicht was wir menschen schaffen in dem wir genexperimente vornehmen in dem wir die natur in regeln zwingen in dem wir unter anderem auch der sexualit t gurte anlegen das alles ist k nstlich ein konstrukt ein gesellschaftlicher zwang den wir eingehen um miteinander auskommen zu k nnen an manchen stellen mag er sinnvoll sein an anderen zerst rt er soviel nat rliches im menschen
5454471 sie wollen damit sagen dass es normal ist dass frauen frauen und m nner m nner lieben
5454472 richtig es ist vollkommen normal wenn es nicht normal w re nicht von der natur eingerichtet w re es l ngst beseitigt worden ebenso wie die natur alles abst t was der mensch heutzutage erschafft
5454473 aber damit unterst tzen sie eine krankheit sie w rden sich doch auch gegen die pest aussprechen aber gegen homosexualit t nicht
5454474 naja es ist doch eine mutation eine abweichung von der nat rlichen norm der zweigeschlechtlichen liebe damit eine krankheit wie die pest auch
5454475 ich verstehe du meinst also dass alle mutationen krankheiten w ren ja na gut nehmen wir einmal an dass die normgr e eines menschen bei etwa 1 7 metern liegt das hei t dass jeder mensch der deutlich von dieser normgr e abweicht also unter 1 6 metern und ber 1 8 metern gro ist eine mutation aufwiese und damit eine krankheit nach deiner einsch tzung von mutation zumindest
5454476 ich gebe dir vollkommen recht mit dem was du gesagt hast julie homosexualit t weicht von der zweigeschlechtlichen liebe ab die in unserer gesellschaft f r gew hnlich als die normale sexualit t angesehen wird weil sie prozentuell am h ufigsten in der natur vorkommt nur begehen wir den denkfehler homosexualit t als etwas unnormales anzusehen nur weil sie nicht in derselben prozentualen verteilung vorkommt obwohl sie eigentlich einen recht hohen anteil in der gesellschaft ausmacht das problem ist dass wir ber die jahrhunderte einen tunnelblick entwickelt haben der uns die augen vor allen abweichungen verschlie en l sst hinzu kommt ein religi s gepr gtes bild vom zusammenleben zweier menschen das meiner meinung nach aber liebe auf reine fortpflanzung beschr nkt w re sexualit t und liebe nicht in aller augen auf die fortpflanzung ausgerichtet g be es kein problem mit homosexualit t dann w re die liebe zwischen zwei frauen oder zwei m nnern ebenso zul ssig wie die zwischen mann und frau aber nur mann und frau k nnen sich eben fortpflanzen
5454477 findest du michi eklig nur weil sie auf m dchen steht sie mochte m dchen schon vor zwei jahren und du hast es nicht einmal gemerkt f r dich war sie nur deine freundin und dass sie gerne mit einer frau zusammen w re irritiert dich pl tzlich macht dein ganzes weltbild von eurer freundschaft kaputt
5454478 sie hat mir erz hlt dass sie angst davor hatte es dir zu gestehen sie wusste wie deine eltern dar ber denken und glaubte dass du ebenso empfinden w rdest ich habe ihr dazu geraten mit dir zu sprechen denn du bist die wichtigste person in ihrem leben nicht ihre mutter nicht ihr vater sondern du
5454479 ja ich habe sie gerade unten mit einer aus der zw lften reden h ren mit der ist sie zusammen
5454480 du bist sechzehn jahre alt die meisten m dchen sind mit sechzehn in irgendeinen jungen verliebt
5454481 ich habe da dr ber nie nachgedacht michi und mich haben diese ganzen geschichten und dieses gekreische immer total genervt mir sind jungs schnuppe aber deshalb stehe ich nicht auf m dchen
5454482 das habe ich auch nicht behauptet aber wieso interessiert es dich wen michi liebt wenn du dich selbst f r dieses thema gar nicht erw rmen kannst michi ist und bleibt dieselbe person
5454483 nein da t uschen sie sich da ist etwas zu ihr hinzugekommen von dem ich nicht wusste dass es existiert es ver ndert vielleicht nicht michi aber es ver ndert unsere beziehung zu einander sie k nnen nicht einfach sagen dass alles ist wie vorher es ist anders
5454484 hast du angst sie k nnte sich in dich verlieben oder dich ber hren obwohl du das nicht willst
5454485 nein quatsch das hat michi noch nie gemacht und sie hat doch eine freundin
5454486 aber wo siehst du ein problem in michis sexualit t
5454487 du willst nicht dass sie anders ist als du ihr seid wie zwillinge und dass ihr euch einmal anders entwickeln k nntet ist dir nie in den sinn gekommen habe ich recht
5454488 doch das passiert julie es h tte auch etwas anderes sein k nnen fr her oder sp ter vielleicht schon nach dem abitur h ttet ihr euch vermutlich getrennt um an verschiedenen universit ten zu studieren oder eine ausbildung zu machen jeder mensch muss seinen eigenen weg gehen das hei t nicht dass er dabei den anderen zwangsweise aus seinem leben verbannt michi will dich nicht verbannen aber sie muss auch an sich und ihre gef hle denken du kannst ihr dabei helfen ihren weg zu finden oder du kannst sie alleine lassen es gibt nur diese zwei m glichkeiten entscheide welche f r dich akzeptabel ist ich kann dir nur sagen dass michi froh w re deine unterst tzung und deine hilfe zu haben die sie noch brauchen wird oft im leben nicht nur weil sie lesbisch ist
5454489 sie meinen ich lasse sie im stich wenn ich das nicht tue oder
5454490 nein nein das w rde sie verstehen du l sst sie nicht im stich nur weil du einen anderen weg einschl gst
5454491 vielleicht redest du ja noch einmal in aller ruhe mit ihr
5454492 es ist also in ordnung f r dich dass ich m dchen mag
5454493 wie meinst du das lieben im sinne von freundschaft f r jemanden empfinden oder richtig lieben
5454494 ich meine liebst du mich genauso wie diese zw lftkl sslerin mit der du zusammen bist
5454495 na mit der du dich heute in der pause bei den spinden gestritten hast
5454496 zarah aber ich bin doch nicht in zarah verliebt wir sind nicht zusammen sie ist nur auch lesbisch aber sie gibt es nicht zu sie hat angst davor alle eltern hier sind noch so konservativ
5454497 aber du hast gesagt dass du in ein m dchen verliebt bist in welches denn bist du mit ihr zusammen oder nicht
5454498 ich bin verliebt aber ich bin nicht mit ihr zusammen
5454499 du willst es wirklich wissen vor einer woche w rest du froh gewesen ich h tte dir nie etwas erz hlt
5454500 eine woche das ist doch schon eine ewigkeit her in wen bist du verliebt sag schon und warum nicht mit ihr zusammen wei sie nichts davon liebt sie dich nicht
5454501 wenn du die wahrheit wissen willst musst du sie auch verkraften k nnen meinst du das schaffst du

5454555 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5454556 i am going with the satisfaction that whatever i have done was for the people and for the country i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5454557 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5454558 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5454559 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5454560 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5454561 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that

5454563 on the other hand are the people of this country the business community and there too i dont see any new initiatives

5454585 we replace the metaphor of progress with the metaphor of a norm the notion that at the bottom the aims and genius of man have remained fundamentally the same that temporal events may cause him to stray far from his sources but that he repeatedly struggles to restore under new particularities the same basic patterns of the good life

5454622 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5454623 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5454624 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5454625 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5454626 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5454635 what is marriage how do i know that i have found it
5454636 there is a forest in front please walk there and dont look back you can only cut one tree and cut the one that you think is the highest because that means you have found marriage
5454637 because according to my previous experience after walking thru the wheat field i came back with nothing so this time when i saw this tree and i think this tree is not so bad i decided to cut it and bring it here i dont want to risk losing it again

5454778 von dem willen eines mannes sondern von gott geboren sind
5454779 das blut jesu seines sohnes reinigt uns von aller s nde
5454780 denn so hat gott die welt geliebt da er seinen eingeborenen sohn gab damit jeder der an ihn glaubt nicht verloren gehe sondern ewiges leben habe
5454781 alle haben ges ndigt und erreichen nicht die herrlichkeit gottes
5454782 wenn wir sagen da wir keine s nde haben betr gen wir uns selbst und die wahrheit ist nicht in uns
5454783 und wenn jemand nicht geschrieben gefunden wurde in dem buch des lebens so wurde er in den feuersee geworfen
5454784 denn aus gnade seid ihr errettet durch glauben und das nicht aus euch gottes gabe ist es nicht aus werken damit niemand sich r hme
5454785 und es ist in keinem anderen das heil denn auch kein anderer name unter dem himmel ist den menschen gegeben in dem wir errettet werden m ssen
5454786 so viele ihn aber aufnahmen denen gab er das recht kinder gottes zu werden denen die an seinen namen glauben

5454952 it is the first time that so many people have travelled with deutsche bahn in germany in the first half
5454953 es un sistema de elecciones populares destinado a la formaci n de un sistema bipartidista en torno a dos grandes partidos pol ticos o coaliciones
5454954 las anteriores consideraciones nos permiten concluir intuitivamente al menos que el sistema electoral juega un rol fundamental en la generaci n de incentivos para la cooperaci n
5454955 de lo anterior por tanto debe quedar claro que cu n proporcional o mayoritario sea un sistema es algo que escapa a la discusi n sobre cu n democr tico es o no un sistema el car cter democr tico debe buscarse en las garant as y derechos queprovee el sistema pol tico y no en el procedimiento de decisi n y representaci n
5454956 uno de los rasgos caracter sticos del sistema binominal es que hace que los bloques en disputa se orienten hacia posiciones medianas del electorado es decir cada bloque se mueve hacia su oponente ideol gico de manera que los bloques en disputa tienden a converger tal convergencia se debe a que cada partido sabe que las posiciones extremas de su propio espectro por definici n lo prefieren a su oponente ya que est n m s pr ximas a ellos que del partido opositor los votantes m s radicales u ortodoxos se ven forzados a votar por el partido o bloque m s cercano a su posici n no importa cuanto se alejen las pol ticas propuestas por ste de su ideal de gobierno
5454957 en la medida en que ambos partidos aplican dicha estrategia en un esfuerzo por atraer a los votantes moderados aquellos cuyas posiciones se ubican entre ambos partidos sus posturas pol ticas se vuelven m s y m s mesuradas y menos radicales la ventaja de orientarse hacia posiciones m s moderadas representadas por el punto medio de la distribuci n mediana de posiciones ideol gicas radica en que dada la forma de la distribuci n cada vez que un partido se mueve hacia el centro mediana en este caso dentro del eje izquierda derecha logra captar una mayor proporci n de votantes
5454958 el sistema binominal hace que los partidos tiendan a agruparse en grandes bloques independientemente que estemos o no en presencia de un sistema multipartidista
5454959 dado que en un sistema binominal se privilegian las grandes mayor as los partidos tender n r pidamente a unirse y fusionarse en alianzas para conseguir umbrales de votaci n mayores de los que individualmente captar an
5454960 como consecuencia de este proceso permanente de fusi n y negociaci n los gustos y preferencias de los votantes llegan a ser relativamente homog neos en el largo plazo

5454964 the main reason that serious content providers or laborers such as plaintiff provide content to youtube com at all

5455019 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5455020 we arrived at saddleback and went into a holding room which is a separate building from the main church in the room there were four or five staff people plus mccain and there was no tv no audio no nothing we talked through a few of the topics we had spent time in the afternoon preparing doing q amp a and we did a few more questions to warm him up at about ten til six the advance guys came to get mccain to take him to the stage because the handshake with obama was a few minutes before 6 p m mccain never heard any of this stuff

5455064 first where adam was second how he was to be saved from where he was third a few words about baptism
5455065 but when they believed philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women even simon himself believed and after being baptized he continued with philip and seeing signs and great miracles performed he was amazed
5455066 while peter was still saying these things the holy spirit fell on all who heard the word and the believers from among the circumcised who had come with peter were amazed because the gift of the holy spirit was poured out even on the gentiles for they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling god then peter declared can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people who have received the holy spirit just as we have and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of jesus christ then they asked him to remain for some days
5455067 for in christ jesus you are all sons of god through faith for as many of you as were baptized into christ have put on christ there is neither jew nor greek there is neither slave nor free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus this was the first century there were no baptisteries it was done outside both believers and unbelievers would have witnessed the baptisms so this was not only an encouragement to the believers but a witness to the lost everyone would know that a person being baptized had forsaken their old religion and now followed and worshipped christ as lord now we have to be careful here the new testament describes two baptisms the first is an invisible baptism in the spirit the second is a visible baptism in water for just as the body is one and has many members and all the members of the body though many are one body so it is with christ for in one spirit we were all baptized into one body jews or greeks slaves or free and all were made to drink of one spirit

5455084 the standardization of video ad formats by the iab was a critical first step in streamlining media buying planning and creative processes across the digital video medium
5455085 our research was a result of our desire to provide data about the effectiveness of those new standards to our clients and partners and to lay a foundation for future research initiatives to build and expand upon
5455086 for the in stream advertising market to evolve the efficacy of ad formats
5455087 this research begins to fill the knowledge gap between the formation of standards and the prophetic future of an efficient and scalable online advertising industry
5455088 this study offers a window into the measurable effectiveness of new video ad formats and it moves forward the broader discussion of online brand building and advertising daniel taylor senior analyst at yankee group
5455089 as the industry develops new ways to engage online audiences its important to benchmark the progress we make

5455099 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5455101 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5455102 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5455103 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5455104 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5455105 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5455106 at its core free the airwaves is a call to action for everyday users you dont need to be a telecommunications expert to understand that freeing the white spaces has the potential to transform wireless internet as we know it when you visit the site youll be invited to film a video response explaining what increased internet access could mean for you to sign a petition to the fcc to contact your elected officials to spread the word and more when it comes to opening these airwaves we believe the public interest is clear but we also want to be transparent about our involvement google has a clear business interest in expanding access to the web theres no doubt that if these airwaves are opened up to unlicensed use more people will be using the internet thats certainly good for google not to mention many of our industry peers but we also think that its good for consumers

5455154 first the difference between ecmascript 3 1 and ecmascript harmony should be made clear 3 1 is a bug fix for the current javascript
5455155 harmony will pick up from 3 1 and try to introduce many of the types of features that were slated for es4 but with different syntax and from a different approach this is great news for everyone since it means that the standards body is going to be working toward a future which is deemed good or bad based on whats good for the language as it will exist in web browsers there is likely a mandate for the language outside of the browser environment but designing the next language in a vacuum of real world users of new syntax was going to hound the es4 effort that risk is now gone
5455156 first you can forget a lot of what you learned about ecmascript 4 previously many of the complicated concepts contained in the language have been tossed instead there is a considerable amount of effort going in to making sure that new features will be easily duplicable through other means
5455157 it will feature many of the things es4 was trying to accomplish but may attempt them from different directions and will focus much more on incremental step wise evolution of the language
5455158 some of the features that were in es4 were reasonable so a new project called harmony is starting which will look at adapting the best of es4 on top of es3 1 the success of this project will depend on the ability of tc39 the ecma technical committee drafting the standard to do a better job of managing the tradeoffs between innovation and stability and adopting a discipline for managing complexity simplicity should be highly valued in a standard simplicity cannot be added instead complexity must be removed
5455159 the folks who have written it this way have gotten it wrong not least of all because they havent been sitting in the meetings and havent see how the resulting differences come from good faith disagreements not simple strategic posturing
5455160 es4 as outlined last fall wasnt adobes language and there was no chance that es3 1 would have ever been as tepid as many assumed microsoft wanted it to be
5455161 major changes to the semantics of adobes initial contribution ensured that any truly compliant es4 implementation from adobe would have required many concessions including the inclusion of a client side compiler
5455162 like adobe microsoft has jumped ahead in the evolution of javascript via the seemingly forgotten jscript net
5455163 like adobe microsoft has had to come back from that position to meet the web where it really is microsoft now ships 3 yes thats right three javascript ish languages which are capable of running in a browser jscript via windows scripting host jscript net and jscript for the dlr dynamic language runtime via silverlight make no mistake about it these are all separate implementations which likely share little if any code
5455164 microsoft can still hold the web hostage to their ailing wsh vm windows scripting host virtual machine by continuing to ignore its performance regardless of bug fixes and syntactic updates doesnt matter if its amputation or debilitating arthritis crippled is crippled for what its worth my interactions with the microsoft reps on tc39 give me no reason to believe that they wont be improving their vm and adobe can still chose to implement a language which implements an ecma spec they can do this any time they damn well please it may not align so cleanly with their current technology roadmap but its absolutely feasible
5455165 what died was an assumption that the web can evolve without implementations being out in front of the spec as3 was one implementation of a javascript like language that might have been a contender for crown of the next one but so was jscript net that neither of them won simply because they had been built in good faith is as true a sign as i can find that the process is working lets end the silly meme that adobe lost or that microsoft won the game has hardly begun and it wont be settled in a standards body anyway what matters and what we all need to keep our eyes keenly trained on is what the big implementations do in the way of compatibility performance and feature set once es3 1 arrives
5455166 these two groups continued to work side by side but a struggle was inevitable
5455167 the ecmascript 3 1 group wanted to add changes to the language that would affect the result of ecmascript 4 this struggle over the past year finally came to a head this past month at the meeting of tc39 the committee responsible for both ecmascript 4 and ecmascript 3 1 dubbed the oslo meeting this discussion between the two groups saw an ultimate conclusion the two efforts had to be merged otherwise neither one would succeed
5455168 unfortunately as is the case with many standards the situation became a tug of war standards arent just about the good of the community they are also now recognized as competitive advantages a new standard for ecmascript thus became mired in a morass of bickering infighting and sometimes out and out name calling the politics of competition it became clear that members could not arrive at the consensus needed to allow a decade of advancements to be incorporated into the next generation of ecmascript
5455169 actionscript 3 is not going away and we are not removing anything from it based on the recent decisions we will continue to track the ecmascript specifications but as we always have we will innovate and push the web forward when possible just as we have done in the past
5455170 actionscript 3 isnt changing and we are not going to dumb down future versions or actionscript
5455171 we are going to continue to innovate on the web with the flash player

5455223 why should we try to maintain something that is actually impossible to maintain which also causes little bother for others and for a certain group actually signifies much pleasure
5455224 of course there are strict rules attached thus condoms must always be cleared away it must never take place in the neighbourhood of childrens playgrounds and the sex must be restricted to the evening and night time

5455226 only have to take corrective action if there is a question of actual offensive behaviour that is visible from the public path
5455227 cruising is something belonging to all time and banning it does not work anyway they do it surreptitiously and mostly without others being annoyed by it but homos at cruising spots are often attacked by now agreeing rules of behaviour on this safety can be increased

5455359 our government is taking real action to support initiatives like these that lead to concrete economic and social benefits for aboriginal and northern communities
5455360 this is one of the main goals of our integrated northern strategy
5455361 i am delighted with this decision to support our partnership with selwyn resources
5455362 were committed to working with selwyn resources to ensure that opportunities for education and training are in place to provide a skilled labour force to fill many of the human resource needs that will be required by the mining company these funds will greatly support our vision for a healthier productive community through a diverse work force and the royalty benefits that will accrue from resource development on kaska traditional territory
5455363 selwyn resources is very pleased to learn of the announcement of the support of the ministry of indian affairs and northern development in providing funding to the liard first nation to participate in the negotiation of a socio economic participation agreement with selwyn for the development of its selwyn project that straddles the yukon and northwest territories border
5455364 we are pleased that the liard first nation have this financial support to allow the timely completion of the sepa and we look forward to the commencement of formal negotiations with them and their participation in the development of this project
5455365 googles goal here is to really see more people having access to the internet

5455367 if its only one day and then its cool afterwards its not a problem
5455368 but usually these heat waves last for some days and it becomes a health problem
5455369 what im personally very concerned about is the middle east and northern india its a heavily populated area and its already very hot there today but it will become much hotter there so they will experience temperatures that will reach up to 125 degrees fahrenheit
5455370 there its not very easy for people to turn on the air conditioning or to pick up and move just because they dont have as many resources
5455371 my preliminary research on india suggests that the impacts on mortality could be quite dramatic
5455372 i think its becoming clearer and clearer that the costs of climate change wont be spread evenly around the globe unfortunately theyre going to be concentrated in countries least able to deal with them just due to low income levels
5455373 changes in temperature are not going to accrue overnight so there will be a lot of time to adapt
5455374 such a move almost certainly would wipe out existing holders of the agencies common stock with preferred shareholders and even holders of the two entities 19b of subordinated debt also suffering losses
5455375 although we think the term stagflation greatly exaggerates the pain in the us economy at least relative to the 1970s when it was initially coined it certainly describes the feel of the past weeks economic data
5455376 inflation surprised on the upside while sentiment remained poor credit conditions tightened and domestic economic activity flagged the only bright spot in the economy is the massive improvement in trade with the rest of the world
5455377 bhps operations leave it in an incredibly strong position over the next 12 months

5455383 if this ceasefire clause on pre 7 august positions is not applied quickly and in its entirety i will convoke an extraordinary council of the european union to decide what consequences to draw
5455384 i expect a very fast very prompt withdrawal of russian troops out of georgia
5455385 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5455386 we will have to determine if the russian intervention against its georgian neighbour was a brutal and excessive response
5455387 in which case there will be inevitable consequences for its relations with the european union
5455388 i do not advise any knee jerk reaction such as suspending talks on a partnership and cooperation agreement with the eu
5455389 our interest in this is as great as russia itself talks in the nato russian council are essential too because we need open lines of communication
5455390 some of russias actions were not proportionate but it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame
5455391 we must stick to the partnership with russia even after these recent events which of course do not please us
5455392 i didnt miss a day of work in the past two years and it paid off

5455395 some in the west speak as if we are dealing with a limited local conflict
5455396 but thats a mistake if the strait of hormuz between the united arab emirates and iran were closed oil prices would be at 400 a barrel overnight
5455397 the fire department of new york is going to christen us with a jet of water
5455398 up to this point all our interactions with the fda will be on the fast track

5455405 even in a challenging economy these incredible and passionate people come through for the jimmy fund and because the tragedy of cancer is pervasive we want to contribute in any way that we can to help dana farber cancer institute battle this insidious disease
5455406 the commitment by dunkin donuts is extraordinary and is vitally important to the work of dana farber we are so grateful for their continued devotion to the jimmy fund and the priority they give it it serves as a vivid example of selfless commitment at its best
5455407 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5455408 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5455409 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5455410 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5455411 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5455412 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5455413 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5455414 i cheated a little bit i actually looked at this idea ahead of time and i think it is a i think its a great idea
5455415 we have safely placed senator mccain in a cone of silence
5455416 now my first question was the cone of silence comfortable that you were in just now
5455417 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5455418 the insinuation suggests that the obama campaign is grasping at falsehoods the facts are that senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed last night senator mccain demonstrated to the american people that he is prepared to be the next president senator mccain never heard or saw any of senator obamas appearance
5455419 pastor rick saw his job as setting up the ball up at the net so the candidates could spike it
5455420 for a minute there there was just two christians worshiping together
5455421 the insinuation that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5455422 cuando el amor llega puede ser ciego pero cuando se va es muy l cido de ah la importancia de acertar en la elecci n y ste me parece un asunto central
5455423 lo que decidas que sea tu noviazgo ser tu futuro matrimonio
5455424 m s vale un trauma en el noviazgo que un matrimonio traum tico
5455425 los novios est n llamados a vivir la castidad en la continencia en esta prueba han de ver un descubrimiento del mutuo respeto un aprendizaje de la fidelidad y de la esperanza de recibirse el uno y el otro de dios reservar n para el tiempo del matrimonio las manifestaciones de ternura espec ficas del amor conyugal deben ayudarse mutuamente a crecer en la castidad
5455426 hace falta una purificaci n y maduraci n que incluyen tambi n la renuncia esto no es rechazar el eros ni envenenarlo
5455427 el servicio m s importante que podemos brindar a nuestros hermanos es el anuncio claro y humilde de jesucristo
5455428 para que el se or sea cada d a m s conocido amado seguido y alabado en esas benditas tierras
5455429 la hora presente es una ocasi n providencial para que con sencillez limpieza de coraz n y fidelidad volvamos a escuchar c mo cristo nos recuerda que no somos siervos sino sus amigos
5455430 l ha vencido el pecado y la muerte nos otorga cotidianamente su perd n nos ense a a perdonar y nos llama a vivir una vida alejada del ego smo que nos esclaviza y colmada del amor que nos engrandece y dignifica
5455431 l nos instruye para que permanezcamos en su amor sin amoldarnos a los dictados de este mundo
5455432 de este modo con toda nuestra vida con el gozo de sabernos amados por jes s a quien podemos llamar hermano seremos instrumentos v lidos para que l siga atrayendo a todos con la misericordia que brota de su cruz
5455433 beban el agua vivificante que mana del costado del salvador y sacien de su frescura cristalina a todos los que est n sedientos de justicia paz y verdad a los que est n sumidos en la cerraz n del pecado o en la oscuridad de la violencia sientan el consuelo de cristo y ofrezcan el b lsamo de su amor a los atribulados a los que andan apesadumbrados por el dolor o han quedado heridos por la frialdad del indiferentismo o el flagelo de la corrupci n
5455434 estos retos exigen superar el individualismo y el aislamiento y reclaman robustecer el sentido de pertenencia eclesial y la colaboraci n leal con los pastores con el fin de formar comunidades cristianas orantes concordes fraternas y misioneras
5455435 a la oraci n perseverante la meditaci n ferviente de la palabra de dios la obediencia al magisterio de la iglesia la digna celebraci n de los sacramentos y el testimonio de la caridad fraterna
5455436 llega la fuerza potente del esp ritu santo que con sus dones y carismas contin a impulsando a la iglesia a pregonar la buena noticia de la salvaci n a cada persona en particular a las que desconocen a cristo o tal vez lo han olvidado llegando hasta los extremos confines de la tierra
5455437 a compartir con otros este tesoro pues no hay riqueza mayor que gozar de la amistad de cristo y caminar a su lado merece la pena consagrar a esta hermosa labor nuestras mejores energ as sabiendo que la gracia divina nos precede sostiene y acompa a en su realizaci n
5455438 en el que aparece cristo glorioso que con sus brazos abiertos acoge a todos
5455439 l nos precede en el camino de la vida y nos ayudar a aspirar a la santidad de modo que se despierte en cada bautizado el misionero que lleva dentro de s y se venza la vacilaci n o la mediocridad que a menudo nos asalta
5455440 ante las dificultades de un ambiente a veces hostil de la escasez de resultados de un ambiente a veces hostil de la escasez de resultados inmediatos y espectaculares o frente a la insuficiencia de medios humanos los invito a no dejarse vencer por el miedo abatir por el des nimo o arrastrar por la inercia
5455441 es demasiado precioso el bien de la vida humana y demasiado indigno del hombre morir o quedar inv lido por causas que en la mayor parte de los casos podr an evitarse
5455442 ante todo por parte de los automovilistas pues los accidentes se deben con frecuencia a la excesiva velocidad y a comportamientos imprudentes sigui diciendo conducir un autom vil en las carreteras p blicas exige sentido moral y sentido c vico
5455443 para promover este ltimo es indispensable la obra constante de prevenci n vigilancia y represi n por parte de las autoridades
5455444 como iglesia nos sentimos directamente interpelados a nivel tico los cristianos tienen que hacer ante todo un examen de conciencia personal sobre su propia conducta de automovilistas
5455445 precisamente de aqu procede la gran responsabilidad de la comunidad eclesial llamada a ser casa hospitalaria para todos signo e instrumento de comuni n para toda la familia humana
5455446 qu importante es sobre todo en nuestro tiempo que toda comunidad cristiana profundice cada vez m s en esta conciencia para ayudar tambi n a la sociedad civil a superar toda posible tentaci n de racismo intolerancia exclusi n y a organizarse con opciones respetuosas de la dignidad de todo ser humano
5455447 una de las grandes conquistas de la humanidad es precisamente la superaci n del racismo
5455448 por desgracia sin embargo reconoci se registran nuevas manifestaciones preocupantes del mismo ligadas con frecuencia a problemas sociales y econ micos que sin embargo nunca pueden justificar el desprecio y la discriminaci n racial
5455449 con atenci n y preocupaci n la situaci n en georgia y me siento particularmente cerca de las v ctimas del conflicto
5455450 un llamamiento para que se alivien con generosidad los graves perjuicios que sufren los refugiados sobre todo las mujeres y los ni os a quienes les falta incluso lo necesario para sobrevivir
5455451 deben garantizarse a las minor as tnicas involucradas en el conflicto la incolumidad y los derechos fundamentales que no pueden ser violados
5455452 la tregua en acto alcanzada gracias a la contribuci n de la uni n europea pueda consolidarse y transformarse en paz estable
5455453 a la comunidad internacional a seguir ofreciendo su apoyo para alcanzar una soluci n duradera a trav s del di logo y de la buena voluntad de todos
5455454 son motivo de profunda angustia las noticias cada vez m s dram ticas de los tr gicos acontecimientos que se est n verificando en georgia y que partiendo de la regi n de osetia del sur ya han causado muchas v ctimas inocentes y obligado a un gran n mero de civiles a dejar sus casas
5455455 que cesen inmediatamente las acciones militares y que se abstengan incluso en nombre de la herencia com n cristiana de ulteriores confrontaciones y retorsiones violentas que pueden degenerar en un conflicto de proporciones a n m s amplias
5455456 rean dese en cambio decididamente el camino del negociado y del di logo respetuoso y constructivo evitando as ulteriores lacerantes sufrimientos a aquellas queridas poblaciones
5455457 a la comunidad internacional y a los pa ses m s influyentes en la situaci n actual a poner por obra todo esfuerzo para sostener y promover iniciativas encaminadas a lograr una soluci n pac fica y duradera en favor de una convivencia abierta y respetuosa
5455458 promover la profundizaci n de la fe y el fortalecimiento de la iglesia para contrarrestar el efecto de las sectas que han captado a muchos cat licos y algunos conceptos teol gicos que han sembrado el desconcierto
5455459 poner al continente americano en estado de misi n para enfrentar el desaf o de que la misi n confiada a la iglesia se halla todav a en los comienzos
5455460 esta opci n permitir hacer de cada iglesia particular el mbito y contexto de la nueva evangelizaci n y la misi n ad gentes y a la vez destinataria y protagonista del anuncio de cristo

5455480 youre fine youre wonderful youre brilliant and competent and i love you sweet boy and i wish it was enough
5455481 just as an indescribable sunset or a breath taking mountaintop vista evokes a spontaneous response so we cannot encounter the worthiness of god without the response of worship if you could see god at this moment you would so utterly understand how worthy he is of worship that you would instinctively fall on you face and worship him
5455482 to pretend to homage to god and intend only the advantage of self is rather to mock him than worship him when we believe that we ought to be satisfied rather than god glorified we set god below ourselves imagine that he should submit his own honor to our advantage we make ourselves more glorious than god
5455483 who do people say that the son of man is
5455484 some say john the baptist others say elijah and others jeremiah or one of the prophets
5455485 you are the christ the son of the living god
5455486 if you dont want it to work you should be honest about it not cripple it with inadequate funding and staffing and what looks like an attempt to make it collapse from within
5455487 essentially the only thing keeping developers from doing what they want are major conflicts and lawsuits
5455488 he cracks his whip tightens his lines whistles to his trembling mustangs urges them to the brink of the precipice and they are going down rackety clatter bang sometimes the horses ahead of the stage and sometimes the stage ahead of the horses all however going down down with a crash
5455489 finally the conglomeration of chains harness coach mustangs and banning were found in an inextricable mass of confusion contusions cracks and breaks piled in a thicket of chaparral at the foot of the mountain

5455491 temos o dever de continuar buscando consensos para concluir a rodada de doha que pode trazer benef cios extraordin rios para os pa ses em desenvolvimento principalmente para os mais pobres

5455495 we feel that swedish based regain records is a solid and up and coming label here in the u s
5455496 they have a professional staff and the resources that are necessary to promote and further develop artists such as pro pain we look forward to a sound and successful partnership with regain
5455497 no end in sight is a great record track after track
5455498 this was not a hard decision to make pro pain are also a very hard working band with a die hard following and regain is very happy to be working with them
5455499 the new cd offers a wide variety of styles more so than any of its predecessors however a fair percentage of the recording is also very traditional in the pro pain sense and sonically heavy no end in sight is exactly the type of album that we wanted to create this time around so we couldnt be more pleased with it
5455500 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5455501 est se aproximando do momento de ter de decidir se fecha
5455502 n o v o apoiar uma companhia cujo modelo de neg cio se deteriorou portanto se n o nos aproximarmos de uma solu o estamos acabados
5455503 all the time and effort and energy they spent all goes for naught and theyre going to have to start over if they are going to do anything or appeal
5455504 either way i think we are in a much much better position
5455505 any mechanism where this city can purge itself of wrongdoing
5455506 we have to abide by the order of the court well review with mr goodman all our options
5455507 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5455508 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5455509 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5455510 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5455511 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern
5455512 for many veterans the closest va facility isnt close enough
5455513 from what ive heard a lot of the 4th brigade was hit pretty hard
5455514 some of the soldiers seemed really grateful for the things we taught them
5455515 come from the hills of georgia and some of them sign for their paycheck with an x
5455516 overall goal is to bring georgia up to nato standards
5455517 i know specifically that bravo company im sure and i hope from what i did for them that theyre better off than they would have been if this happened four weeks ago
5455518 it was not an absolutely decisive factor whether georgians were trained by americans or not
5455519 what happened was due to the political decision of georgian authorities and not the performance on the ground
5455520 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5455521 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5455522 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5455523 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5455524 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5455525 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5455526 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5455527 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5455528 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5455529 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5455530 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5455531 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5455532 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5455533 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5455534 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5455535 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5455536 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5455537 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5455538 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5455539 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5455540 pakistan and the united states have a joint interest in fighting terror
5455541 thats what were concentrating on that and helping pakistan to sustain its economy to build its schools its health we have a broad pakistan policy
5455542 it is a promo for our loyal users and online merchandisers
5455543 that the us could convincingly deny any involvement with the destruction it causes
5455544 further there would be no munition fragments that could be used to identify the source of the strike
5455545 this is a major step toward providing the ultra precision engagement capability that the warfighter needs to dramatically reduce collateral damage

5455553 enough zombie pcs to take down an entire countrys infrastructure for a month
5455554 the use of the internet to create an online mob has proven itself and will likely receive more attention in the future
5455555 some 120 governments are actively engaged in web espionage and cyber assaults
5455556 cyber assaults have become more sophisticated in their nature designed to specifically slip under the radar of government cyber defenses
5455557 attacks have progressed from initial curiosity probes to well funded and well organized operations for political military economic and technical espionage
5455558 were already starting to see that with state sponsored malware
5455559 i only think youre going to start seeing more than that because its easier to attack government xs database than it is to nuke their troops
5455560 the emergence of a complex and sophisticated market for malware
5455561 these super strength threats are more resilient are modified over and over again like recombinant dna
5455562 nuwar storm worm was the first example and there will be more in 2008
5455563 underground economy already includes specialized auction sites product advertising and even support services but now competition is so fierce that customer service has become a specific selling point
5455564 private criminals used the storm worm to created a botnet for hire containing millions of zombies
5455565 as you try to investigate storm it knows and it punishes
5455566 they find these things but never say anything about them
5455567 its running but its not doing anything you can brain dead anything
5455568 its getting more serious the more i look at it
5455569 im more concerned not so much about where storm is today but where its going
5455570 the majority of victims are not even aware that their computer has been compromised or their personal information exploited
5455571 through this process the fbi may uncover additional incidents in which botnets have been used to facilitate other criminal activity
5455572 the bots caused the infected computers to among other things repeatedly freeze or reboot causing significant delays in the provision of medical services
5455573 wouldnt you think its a really good deal considering what they paid for them it was a gift
5455574 we sold them for what the market determined them to be worth
5455575 oh cedric i cant believe you are dead oh cedric now youre in twilight instead oh cedric vampires are no fun to haunt oh but edward you can bite me if you want
5455576 five years ago when we were first starting out wed autograph shirts and say start your own band about books
5455577 we just wanted to present a different idea of what a band could be
5455578 we wanted to play music that you wouldnt normally see on the tv or the radio
5455579 we werent thinking we would create a wizard rock movement it just evolved
5455580 but its cool to see bands about books realized in some way
5455581 some people dont like twilight potentially becoming the new harry potter theres a lot of groaning and moaning about the movie coming out and the fact that there is twilight music kind of bothers some people
5455582 twilight is sort of like the hannah montana of literature
5455583 if youre outside the 14 to 16 year old age range you might listen to it and it might get stuck in your head but its not good literature its not really enriching your life the way harry potter might
5455584 love is never going to get old and if you can find new ways to talk about love you can find new ways to write about twilight but i dont think twilight is as powerful as harry potter is twilight is about love and being a teenager and wondering if you fit in and harry potter is that and so much more
5455585 for us its a community not so much a genre of music and i dont know if they have a community yet if they all get together if the bands are as close as all of us are
5455586 i dont think it could have a movement on its own
5455587 but wizard rock can expand to be bands themed about other books it doesnt just have to be about harry potter anyone who is singing about any book can be part of wizard rock
5455588 if youre a male twilight fan i highly recommend starting a band named edward and the cullens
5455589 financial responsibility changing ones financial path from consuming own savings to growing
5455590 o que fizeram os dirigentes georgianos excede os marcos da raz o seus atos n o podem ser explicados mais ainda deixados impunes

5455596 queria precisar termos existe o conceito de retirada e o de recuo na conversa do presidente da r ssia dmitri medvedev com o presidente da fran a nicolas sarkozy s se falou de recuo
5455597 espero que tenham percebido isto n o se trata de uma retirada
5455598 estamos convencidos de que dali gori n o emana nenhum perigo e por isto nos retiramos a partir de hoje
5455599 a ge rgia est disposta ao di logo para resolver todos os problemas conflituosos de forma civilizada mas para isto as tropas de ocupa o devem sair e devem parar de destruir a ge rgia
5455600 ik trek het mij persoonlijk aan dat u de waarde van uw beleggingen zo hebt zien kelderen
5455601 de overgrote meerderheid van aandeelhouders groot en klein en ook van onze klanten is gelukkig en steunt ons
5455602 kunnen wij conclusies aan deze bijeenkomst verbinden kunnen wij ons erop beroepen
5455603 dit soort avonden zullen we op reguliere basis voor u organiseren
5455604 eigenlijk heb ik niet zo veel grote zorgen over dit bedrijf alle financi le fondsen hebben het momenteel zwaar ik dacht dat ik fortis op het dieptepunt kocht op 12 euro als ik een zorg heb gaat die over het geringe vertrouwen dat er bestaat in de financi le sector in het algemeen maar ik denk dat in 2009 en 2010 het vertrouwen weer terugzal keren
5455605 wat gaan ze doen om het geschonden vertrouwen van de aandeelhouders te herstellen
5455606 een speciale aandeelhoudersvergadering zoals door de veb wordt voorgesteld is naar mijn mening overdreven er zijn wel enkele onderdelen uit het tienpuntenplanplan van de veb die volgens mij belangrijk zijn fortis zou bijvoorbeeld de risico en controlesystemen moeten versterken ook zou het bedrijf moeten werken aan de transparantie en die verbeteren zoals is voorgesteld
5455607 ik erger me groen en geel aan de mediahetze die dit bedrijf treft de georkestreerde campagne van de veb beleggersvereniging red heeft de problemen waarin fortis verkeert verergerd het begon met de kritiek op de beloning van bestuursvoorzitter votron vervolgens stapt meneer slagter directeur van de veb red het fortiskantoor binnen met een cameraploeg van het journaal in zijn kielzog en dan komt de beschuldiging van misleiding aan het adres van de raad van bestuur allemaal negatieve kritiek die niet het belang van de aandeelhouders heeft gediend
5455608 wanneer houdt de veb nu eens op met die hetze
5455609 votron moet terugkeren als bestuursvoorzitter hij is een fantastische vent een ziener met amerikaanse doortastendheid alleen hij is in staat om fortis weer uit de problemen te krijgen het is een schande dat hij het veld heeft moeten ruimen
5455610 flink verlies ik heb mn aandelen gekocht voor ruim 24 euro nu staat de koers onder de 10
5455611 de situatie met de kredietcrisis bezorgt alle beleggers veel onzekerheid maar voor de aandeelhouders van dit bedrijf is het extra pijnlijk dat het bestuur anders dan beloofd toch zijn dividendbeleid heeft gewijzigd
5455612 mijn aandelenbelang is te klein om echt boos te zijn maar ik ben erg benieuwd of het management eigenlijk zelf weet of alle leed nu is geschikt de onverwachte kapitaalmaatregelen van eind juni bewijzen dat de raad van bestuur er goed in is zaken te onderschatten
5455613 any legislation going before my committee will be held until the answers are before us or myself and my colleagues have time to thoroughly analyze all this legislation
5455614 its a bipartisan piece of legislation and it takes the best elements
5455615 it has both tax elements and a pooling mechanism unlike other legislation however the choice act creates a cooperative that can work with existing state law
5455616 the temple is sure to be rebuilt right now weve got to prepare to believe to make the redemption happen
5455617 for the launching of missiles or the exploding of the mosque
5455618 i learned about many cultures that i didnt even know existed and i heard many languages that ive never heard before
5455619 in the us alone we have 190 000 tech job openings per year with only 80 000 technology related college graduates

5455627 if its only one day and then its cool afterwards its not a problem
5455628 but usually these heat waves last for some days and it becomes a health problem
5455629 what im personally very concerned about is the middle east and northern india its a heavily populated area and its already very hot there today but it will become much hotter there so they will experience temperatures that will reach up to 125 degrees fahrenheit
5455630 there its not very easy for people to turn on the air conditioning or to pick up and move just because they dont have as many resources
5455631 my preliminary research on india suggests that the impacts on mortality could be quite dramatic
5455632 i think its becoming clearer and clearer that the costs of climate change wont be spread evenly around the globe unfortunately theyre going to be concentrated in countries least able to deal with them just due to low income levels
5455633 changes in temperature are not going to accrue overnight so there will be a lot of time to adapt
5455634 hasta hace una d cada la gente gay era considerada como una amenaza a la seguridad nacional y hasta hace tan s lo dos d cadas eran perseguidos y expulsados de las agencias de seguridad

5455641 thunderstorms triggered by an approaching cold front have the potential to become severe this afternoon main threats are torrential downpours damaging winds and intense lightning radar at 2 45 pm shows a band of thunderstorms extending from southern georgian bay to expected to start moving southeast at 40 km h later this afternoon and may reach the kitchener to hamilton areas between 3 30 and 4 30 pm a few thunderstorms are also developing ahead of this band closer to the lake erie shore
5455642 this tornado was rated as a fujita scale zero tornado with peak winds around 100 km h this rating is the lowest on the fujita wind damage scale which starts at zero and goes up to 5 this is the 9th tornado of the season so far in ontario

5455646 il suo stato un avvio di gara incredibile ma gi alla fine del primo giro ho capito che per lui sarebbe stato difficile fuggire 50 punti sono un bel vantaggio
5455647 sicuramente la vittoria di laguna seca stata molto importante per il morale mio e della squadra continua rossi da tre gare stoner ci faceva paura l abbiamo visto che ce la potevamo fare e abbiamo lavorato duro oggi sono state decisive in particolare le modifiche che abbiamo fatto dopo il warm up di stamattina abbiamo migliorato il bilanciamento di pesi e andavamo pi veloci in curva in pi avevamo le gomme giuste per arrivare fino in fondo
5455648 cold when i am denied it your light is ultraviolet
5455649 the hope is so high that it will have some effect that everybodys asking for it
5455650 we dont have any data yet that says taking an otherwise healthy adult whos vitamin d deficient and supplementing them prevents cancer reduces the risk of heart disease
5455651 you just have to keep your eyes and ears open to make sure something doesnt show up counterintuitive to what people thought
5455652 any kind of deficiency needs to be addressed whether patients are convinced or the medical world is convinced that vitamin d goes beyond bones is irrelevant
5455653 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense

5455664 as i walkd through the wilderness of this world and i laid me down in that place to sleep and as i slept i dreamed a dream i dreamed and behold i saw a man cloathed with raggs standing in a certain place with his face from his own house a book in his hand and a great burden upon his back i looked and saw him open the book and read therein and as he read he wept and trembled and not being able longer to contain he brake out with a lamentable cry saying what shall i do

5455680 we see tremendous growth opportunities in providing the millions of users on business and social networks with an alternative to ebay and the ability to transform their personal profile pages beyond information sharing
5455681 i see open fields for far more important researches psychology will be securely based on the foundation already well laid by mr herbert spencer that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation evolution much light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history
5455682 when i mention the term behavioral neuroscience among a group of religious studies scholars or sinologists
5455683 most smile politely and begin slowly backing away casting about for a safe exit route
5455684 aquarius is a miscellaneous set of stars all at different distances from us which have no connection with each other except that they constitute a meaningless pattern when seen from a certain not particularly special place in the galaxy here
5455685 during many ages there were witches the bible said so the bible commanded that they should not be allowed to live therefore the church after doing its duty in but a lazy and indolent way for 800 years gathered up its halters thumbscrews and firebrands and set about its holy work in earnest she worked hard at it night and day during nine centuries and imprisoned tortured hanged and burned whole hordes and armies of witches and washed the christian world clean with their foul blood then it was discovered that there was no such thing as witches and never had been one does not know whether to laugh or to cry
5455686 most people i believe think that you need a god to explain the existence of the world and especially the existence of life they are wrong but our education system is such that many people dont know it
5455687 paranormal phenomena have a habit of going away whenever they are tested under rigorous conditions this is why the 740 000 reward of james randi offered to anyone who can demonstrate a paranormal effect under proper scientific controls is safe

5455689 but somehow he himself did not seem at home there even then and nothing seemed to belong to him though there was little enough in that house to be possessed by anyone apart from the two old chairs in which we sat down and the tiny misshapen table between them the few other objects i could see appeared to have been brought together only by accident or default as if a child had put all the odd leftover furnishings of her dollhouse into an odd leftover room a huge trunk lying in the corner its great tarnished lock sprung open and its heavy straps falling loosely to the floor would have looked much less sullen buried away in an attic or a cellar and that miniature chair by the door with an identical twin fallen on its back near the opposite wall belonged in a childs room but a child whom one could not imagine as still living even as a dim memory in the most ancient mind the tall bookcase by the shuttered window would have seemed in keeping if only those cracked pots bent boots and other paraphernalia foreign to bookcases had not been stuffed among its battered volumes a large bedroom bureau stood against one wall but that would have seemed misplaced in any room the hollows of its absent drawers were deeply webbed with disuse all of these things seemed to me wracked by their own history of transformation culminating in the metamorphoses of decay and there was a thick dreamy smell that permeated the room inspiring the sense that invisible gardens of pale growths were even then budding in the dust and dirty corners everywhere around me
5455690 what does it mean to be alive except to court disaster and suffering at every moment
5455691 on the situation with hummer brand we can say the following russian machines neither received any proposals to consider acquisition of the hummer assets nor is strategically interested in such a deal
5455692 now japan is a very small flat unified world everything is very small and very much the same there are no others it tends to be relaxing but it can also be dull you cant meet with the new or the strange
5455693 i think there are two types of people who depict things one is the writer who believes that nobody would understand so he puts all kinds of things into his work very vigorously the other type is a writer who has some sort of belief that somebody might understand his or her work and might be able to share the writers loneliness or sadness together this type will put only one keyword into his work
5455694 but important things do calm us and enrage us at the same time dont they
5455695 desperate times call for desperate measures and thats what were seeing from gm
5455696 its sad because if you look at the list its heavily minority it looks bad
5455697 the tribune is where minority reporters can go to die they get lost in the bureaucracy and theyre ignored
5455698 my daughters i dont want them to ever confront a situation where they are disadvantaged because of their gender

5455985 en este momento tenemos dos escalas de capacitaci n docente una es con los que reci n ingresaron este a o y otro grupo integran los docentes auxiliares avanzados que ya est n trabajando

5456093 he mccain was in a panel the other day with rick warren some of you may have seen it and rick warren asked him how do you define rich
5456094 i guess if youre making 3 million dollars a year youre middle class
5456095 i think if youre just talking about income how about 5 million dollars
5456096 im sure that comment will be distorted but the point is that we want to keep peoples taxes low and increase revenues
5456097 as was immediately predicted by john mccain after he made the remark barack obama is already distorting his comment about the definition of rich in america remember when barack obama said he was tired of distortion name calling and sound bite solutions to complicated problems neither do we
5456098 asked about defining who is rich in the context of raising taxes
5456099 firmly believes in not raising any americans taxes its not the job of government to define who is rich

5456107 some believe that it enables us to get in touch with our inner beings and draw on this source of inner strength others suggest that being able to focus the mind allows for greater productivity in problem solving we can learn what is and what is not important and what we should or should not be focusing on
5456108 numerous studies show that happy individuals are successful across multiple life domains including marriage friendship income work performance and health
5456109 well youre too smart for any of our playbook tricks to get past you and yet for some reason you never seem to resist any of them instead you give into them even when you can see them

5456111 and in this final moment may the god emperor be praised for onto us has he deemed us worthy to take us in rapture look around you my children gaze upon the wonder that is mans failing how even now as we all look upon the face of our demise we still scramble to live and in a fit of irony can we not accept
5456112 we have brought about the emperors wrath and even now in this final moment we deny his glory this demise is our own doing we may walk with our lord in heaven but here shall they be left to rot with not but the company of the heretics many in their heart know that what has occured and are finally understanding that the blow that has occured is a fatal one and seek deliverence
5456113 but what of the others how can we we who through the grace of the emperor shall be allowed a reprieve from apocalypse sit their and condemn them to this fate have we no heart nor compassion no soul i tell you this no good citizen of the imperium can walk away from those who suffer and though it is not our place to judge them it is in our place to save them
5456114 so rejoice my children for we have the power to do just that spare them the fate of oblivion the turmoil of the apocalypse we shall not walk alone in this final hour but shall do so with all of the god emperors children may we all walk together and in this final hour find salvation

5456131 as more and more information is collected and kept on all of us we are very concerned that appropriate safeguards go along with that
5456132 people should know what is happening with their information and have a choice

5456134 companies such as google and internet service providers are building up huge databases of data about internet users

5456160 brett now that youre getting married you can have as much sex as you want just dont rub this stuff on your penis it hurts
5456161 o k well just create a job specifically tailored to your skill set
5456162 we have to move away from this total ban and find ways for people to let off steam a little bit more but safely
5456163 weve got to allow political videos but with some safeguards
5456164 you have shown that you are a very dangerous individual indeed i consider that you pose a very significant risk to the public and you are a dangerous offender
5456165 this website whilst appearing to operate on the margins of legality was clearly a front for the sinister sexual abuse of children and an image trading ground for paedophiles
5456166 trying to be like white zombie and not even managing to do that
5456167 so i thought about taking up chewing tobacco but realized that that is fucking disgusting so i bought a pack of cigarettes instead
5456168 um maybe one or two but theyre really just there to make me feel bad ass oh y eah i also bought a bandana and tied it around my head hows that for road worthy
5456169 i know i mean theres a lot you can use a bandana for
5456170 seriously and maybe ill find a stick tie it around the end and use it as a little pack
5456171 and i can tie it around my face and hold up a bank
5456172 hmmm yeah and if im going to be an outlaw im want to be bonnie ish not wild wild west and i dont really have time to stop somewhere and buy a beret and violin case so i guess robbing a bank is out
5456173 totally ok keep brainstorming about things that nomad erin would do and call me if you think of anything else cool meanwhile im going to download some willie nelson
5456174 were excited to get our pads on its exciting because we have been waiting for this since last season ended and its finally here now
5456175 when youre not in pads it seems to drag on a bit and i can see the kids are pretty excited to finally get into full contact
5456176 our first pregame will just be to work the kinks out this year we have so many juniors were counting on that were waiting to find out who can actually play at this level
5456177 we got a lot of people who can play and that takes some pressure off of everybody else
5456178 once you get pads on thats when the football season really starts
5456179 thats when you start to find out whos a player and whos not theres only so much you can learn playing two hand touch
5456180 with most teams you have the opportunity to take your kids to a full contact camp before august
5456181 we didnt get that opportunity so i am still meeting a lot of the new players
5456182 theres going to be some bruised egos and who knows what else by the end of the week
5456183 we pretty much were together all summer for four days a week but there is nothing like the first day with pads strapping them back up
5456184 you have to retrain them that football is a collision sport and you find out the guys who play well in pads versus the guys that dont
5456185 the kids that like to hit are excited today and the kids are tentative arent right now eventually all our kids will be hitters but some arent ready yet mentally and physically
5456186 i was one of the first ones here because i couldnt wait to get it strapped up i want to hit somebody
5456187 im real happy we are playing our first game in 11 days although i wish it was in three days i dont want to sound too confident but were looking to win state nothing under that
5456188 this is my 25th year coaching and this is by far the fastest team ive ever coached and ive coached a couple state championship teams
5456189 we are about where we expected to be at this point in time but there is plenty of room for improvement
5456190 our first season goal is to make the playoffs and after that we will readjust our goals but we want to be a physical team
5456191 the behavior that we want to promote is to protect one of our most precious natural resources so that we all are doing our part to help the environment this water conservation rate provides a financial incentive for water customers to do just that
5456192 an increasing number of drugs are including genetic information in their labels and were finding out how genes affect some drugs that have been widely used for generations
5456193 studying this field can advance pharmacy care to remove some of the trial and error in how medications are prescribed
5456194 medcos partnership with the fda should help establish gene testing as a tool to help lower health care costs and improve the quality of care
5456195 this will come from reducing waste from treatments that do not work and also from helping prevent unnecessary hospitalizations from incorrect dosages or other adverse drug events
5456196 fall is a great time of year to visit put in bay

5456239 this survey data offers cause for concern about the financial habits of lmi americans especially those of hispanic descent
5456240 despite access to financial information low and moderate income people show very low awareness of basic financial concepts such as personal credit as well as of financial products that often constitute the foundation of personal wealth not surprisingly many need smarter money management habits particularly with regard to credit and debt providing education and access to asset building products seem to be the logical first steps to bridge this gap

5456317 not just to us but to the people who suffered at hands what we are talking about is dog breeding lets get this into perspective
5456318 the cavaliers brain is like a size 10 foot shoved into a size 6 shoe it doesnt fit
5456319 people are carrying out breeding which would be first of all entirely illegal in humans and secondly is absolutely insane from the point of view of the health of the animals in some breeds they are paying a terrible terrible price in genetic disease
5456320 the show world is about an obsession about beauty and there is a ridiculous concept that that is how we should judge dogs
5456321 it takes no account of temperament or fitness for purpose potentially as a pet animal and that to me makes no sense at all it is a parade of mutants a freakish beauty pageant
5456322 90 per cent of all pure breed dogs were healthy

5456326 it is similar to devices that used to be used in the province by other groups
5456327 but when it the semtex was passed over to different groups how it came to be in their possession i dont know at this point in time

5456356 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5456357 now go back to making your movies about women who love to handle big guns that shoot hundreds of people to death

5456359 i am excited to announce our first quarterly earnings results since our successful listing on the nyse arca on july 30 2008 our listing represents a major milestone towards achieving our vision to be the best comprehensive online education provider in china our well established brand diversified and extensive course offerings and high quality teaching and support services are the main drivers of our strategy to continue to penetrate the growing market for professional education in china and as a result we believe we are well positioned for further growth
5456360 we are pleased with our third quarter financial performance despite the impact from the sichuan earthquake in may 2008 this result reflects the strong demand for our education services across our product lines as well as investments we made to support the growth of our businesses such as increased headcount and spending on advertising and infrastructure as compared to the same period last year these investments are designed to support the companys growth plan to be the leading provider of online education in china
5456361 despite a challenging operating environment for the quarter we are proud to announce adjusted eps expectations above our q2 guidance
5456362 the broadcast group continues to deliver high margins and we intend to further invest and expand the television business with a particular focus on sports we believe this will be a significant driving force to our business over the next several years
5456363 we expect our future growth to be driven by the expansion of our media assets and distribution channels and the integration and coordination of such efforts across our operating groups our television viewer demographics are very strong and combined with our existing core competence xfmedia today is able to penetrate a significant group of households in china providing us with a strategic entry point to build on our advertising revenue
5456364 we looked up and it looked like lots of confetti falling out of the sky
5456365 a twin engined plane then came toward us falling all the time it was going to hit us or could have gone onto the housing estate
5456366 but i think the pilot must have realised what was going to happen because the plane then banked very very sharply like they do in those acrobatic displays
5456367 it the aircraft had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry it was approximately two miles from the runway
5456368 we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft which was also hoping to land at coventry
5456369 we are conducting a joint investigation with the air accidents investigation branch and warwickshire fire and rescue service to try to find out what has happened
5456370 i would not be surprised if it is windy enough to cause some disruption with trees in full leaf and heavy rain weakening soil it does not take much to bring branches down
5456371 the good news is the weather should calm down later in the week
5456372 the bank holiday weekend looks quite promising especially for southern and eastern areas of the uk which might get some nice warm weather
5456373 the jet stream is close to or south of the uk which means more wet and windy weather streaming through with intervals of sunshine however the different forecasting models are disagreeing with each other on where and when the rain will drop which shows that the outlook is very uncertain and theres very little confidence in the medium range forecasts at the moment
5456374 al fin te encuentro toma que ya lo ten a preparado
5456375 you have shown that you are a very dangerous individual indeed i consider that you pose a very significant risk to the public and you are a dangerous offender
5456376 forensic analysis by computer experts established that the defendant had 241 000 indecent photographs of children being one of the largest seizures of indecent photographs in the uk
5456377 the defendants role was to police the website which gave him the opportunity to transfer these images to his computer
5456378 the evidence recovered from his computer showed he had amassed a vast collection of indecent photographs of children
5456379 it appeared the defendant kept some of the most serious images to use as trading chips
5456380 the crown would say that this collection of indecent photographs and the subsequent police investigation revealed that this defendant has been involved in the distribution of these photographs for the last four or five years
5456381 one who is not taking part in the battle nor has the sheer intention to die is in the branch of hypocrisy

5456400 i saw a plane travelling east coming down sharply straight towards the woods
5456401 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50 feet up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees then i realised that the plane was going down and it disappeared into the woods it was weird because there was no bang
5456402 small pieces started falling down to the ground the twin engine was damaged to the right it plunged and then recovered a small height we thought it had managed to recover but it came down on our left hand side then we heard a large rumble
5456403 our aircraft was on its final approach to land at coventry airport and was in contact with air control it was just one minute away from landing
5456404 they were four highly respected and very well qualified members of the team all our thoughts and prayers are with the families we are a small company and we know all our employees very well we are like one big family
5456405 they were talking to air traffic control and were we believe cleared to land
5456406 we are used to dealing with traffic collisions where people can die but this is the first of its kind for me there was nothing that could have been done to have saved the people inside
5456407 as far as i am aware the single engine aircraft disintegrated pretty much in mid air
5456408 anybody who saw anything suspicious would they please come forward no matter how small the detail is to the police
5456409 this happened two days after he came home to sydney mr keohane said

5456422 it is growing increasingly likely that the treasury will recapitalize fannie and freddie in the months ahead on the taxpayers dime availing itself of powers granted it under the new housing bill signed into law last month
5456423 it may be curtains soon for the managements and shareholders of beleaguered housing giants fannie mae and freddie mac it is growing increasingly likely that the treasury will recapitalize fannie and freddie in the months ahead on the taxpayers dime availing itself of powers granted it under the new housing bill signed into law last month such a move almost certainly would wipe out existing holders of the agencies common stock with preferred shareholders and even holders of the two entities 19 billion of subordinated debt also suffering losses
5456424 that is a violation of grammar up with which i cannot put
5456425 well i report to chris but i also kind of report to sally
5456426 the companies fnma and freddie mac also appear to have boosted their capital ratios by sharply curtailing their repurchases of soured mortgages from securitizations theyve guaranteed the fourth quarter of last year for instance freddie mac took a loss of 736 million on loans repurchased in this years first quarter that figure dropped to 51 million a stunning decline in view of the continued deterioration of the housing and mortgage markets instead the company made the interest payments to bring the mortgage current a much smaller outlay but a tactic that only pushes an inevitable loss forward into the future quarters

5456437 i think that would be up to first of all to john to decide whether he wants a pro choice running mate then we would have to see how the republican party would rally around it

5456439 the last time i checked the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states

5456443 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5456444 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5456445 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5456446 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5456447 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5456448 we very much regret the need to continue with this action but we must protect our patients from illness and not expose others to illness along with the impact on staffing levels in some areas

5456465 its important for the people of florida to know the citizen soldiers and airmen of the florida national guard are prepared to respond to tropical storm fay as assigned by the florida division of emergency management
5456466 the national guard is poised to provide humanitarian aid security equipment debris removal and search and rescue assistance
5456467 the guard has continuous contact and coordination in effect with the florida division of emergency management in tallahassee and has established planning cells to ensure a rapid build up of personnel and equipment if needed
5456468 we have much experience in responding to emergencies and we will continue to rise to the occasion
5456469 include the police militia groups the taliban other anti government elements and the international forces
5456470 widespread intentional killings in violation of human rights or humanitarian law
5456471 we find much of the substance and the overall tone of his alstons statement inaccurate and unsubstantiated
5456472 we are surprised and reject the suggestion that international military forces have killed 200 civilians during 2008
5456473 in many cases appear to have been lawful though tragic
5456474 for which no state or military command appears ready to acknowledge responsibility
5456475 based on my discussions there is no reason to doubt that at least some of these units are led by personnel belonging to international intelligence services
5456476 it is absolutely unacceptable for heavily armed internationals accompanied by heavily armed afghan forces to be wandering around conducting dangerous raids that too often result in killings without anyone taking responsibility for them
5456477 shows no respect to the soldiers and airmen and women who day after day act within the laws of armed conflict often at risk of their own lives in order to reduce the risk to civilians to the minimum possible
5456478 such slipshod language is also evident in comments that there is no evidence of widespread intentional killings of civilians by international forces and that in many cases air strikes appear to be lawful this implies there are occasions when isaf forces do act unlawfully and this is not only rejected by isaf but we consider it irresponsible given the absence of evidence and the seriousness of the allegation
5456479 overwhelming source of extra judicial killings in afghanistan the insurgents
5456480 this disgusting tactic is inherently indiscriminate and involves combatants disguising themselves as civilians in order to close on isaf and other forces
5456481 as enforcers of law and order but as promoters of the interests of a specific tribe or commander

5456596 there is no way of proving what the bloggers hope which is that no mention of this story was made until after the books publication and even if that were the case all it would prove is that john mccain didnt tell this story until after the books publication not that it didnt happen

5456803 now peter is singled out and included in the group who are commanded to follow to galilee it is not yet too late for them to become disciples once more the message is thus not simply a command but an assurance that the death and resurrection of jesus bring forgiveness and the opportunity to begin again

5456827 i never minded the cutting weight the long hours the pain it was all part of the game i still love it but it hasnt been the same lately i didnt feel the same walking to the cage like i used to
5456828 first it was the shoulder then the hip then the back i used to jump out of bed in the morning and say lets go but now its like snap crackle pop as i take baby steps to get up i remember when i could reach behind my back and join my hands together in the middle
5456829 i wish i would have stopped after the art santore fight
5456830 i had my shoulder surgery and thought everything was ok so i took the terry martin fight but it wasnt okay i wasnt the way i used to be mentally and i think i let the surgery get to me
5456831 me and josh barnett used to run the stairs right over here and then go out and have fun
5456832 we would go to a bar and laugh about someday were going to be in the ufc dennis hallman and jeff monson would come up from olympia and we had aaron riley and benji radach here in those days it was just fun training with those guys
5456833 who would i like one last fight with nathan marquardt
5456834 just because i didnt perform well it was the main event that night and i just didnt bring it i asked for a rematch immediately but it never happened
5456835 if i had to pick one fight that was the high point it was probably andrei semenov i had some tears in my eyes after that one i went back to the locker room and said wow i did it
5456836 regrets none but i wish mma had gotten big earlier when i was a younger man i wish this huge surge the sport is going through happened when i was still fresh you know mo maurice smith salaverrys friend and training partner his old ass is still fighting but im done
5456837 the focus now is on building my teams with usa boxing and usa grappling
5456838 im focusing my guys on those amateur style tournaments and when they get four or five of each under their belts then well talk mma but its got to be a professional promotion i am so over the expletive pfc the parking lot fighting championships you know everyone thinks they can throw up a cage in a bar and let anyone in to make money now i wont let my guys do that stuff

5456848 being able to stand on the biggest stage an athlete has is the best feeling you could have
5456849 im more excited than nervous right now but i feel like the training will pay off
5456850 for me at my age and coaching 30 years and having this chance to live the dream man i havent slept in a month
5456851 what we hope for our olympics is to get that disabled athlete of any kind to think you know what i can do this too

5456857 training camp is very physically demanding theres some things that come up whether it be a foot or an arm
5456858 its just trying to be smart trying to understand its a long season and not going out there and aggravating something
5456859 im not naive to the challenge associated with this event
5456860 this is about the chinese government using the torch for political purposes and were going to use it right back

5456881 the chems are my heroes so its a bit strange to be warming up for them
5456882 i am feeling pretty nervous but probably not half as nervous as the chems as they were booted off the decks 14 years ago at space and they havent been back since
5456883 im feeling confident because my set last week at space was one of my best sets of the year
5456884 when you play week in week out sometimes you get a bit down on the road but every once in a while you get an amazing night that fills you with inspiration
5456885 last weeks gig will keep me going for at least a month
5456886 i dont spend enough time listening to other djs but i think its really important
5456887 for instance dubfire was inspired to change his sound after a trip to dc10 a couple of summers ago and look where he is today
5456888 being a dj is a dream come true and im going to keep it going as long as i can
5456889 one minute youre playing to 2000 people and a few minutes later youre in a hotel room by yourself
5456890 the difference between those two situations can leave you feeling lonely
5456891 nowadays it is harder more than ever to make it as dj
5456892 it seems like most promoters are too scared to book new djs so they end up choosing the same big names which doesnt help matters
5456893 when james zabiela and i broke through we were lucky to get there just for our dj skills but these days a dj has to be a producer as well
5456894 before i used to spend hours burning cds but now its so much easier to organise music
5456895 for instance on my flight over to ibiza i spent three hours preparing my set in traktor and working out the keys of my tracks with the mixed in key program
5456896 preparation is key for a dj set and now i always know my set time whos playing before me and whos playing after me
5456897 i have tried using ableton live for my dj sets but traktor feels a lot more exciting than ableton which can sometimes feel static
5456898 i think as a dj you have to pay respect to the next artist and give them room to move
5456899 we were joking earlier that id end my set with star guitar before the chems and then walk off triumphantly but theres nothing worse that somebody playing your biggest records before your set
5456900 so my set tonight got quite pumping in parts but i played it slow for the last 10 minutes in order to set the chemical brothers up properly
5456901 the chems are my heroes so its a bit strange to be warming up for them
5456902 i am feeling pretty nervous but probably not half as nervous as the chems as they were booted off the decks 14 years ago at space and they havent been back since
5456903 the chems are my heroes so its a bit strange to be warming up for them
5456904 i am feeling pretty nervous but probably not half as nervous as the chems as they were booted off the decks 14 years ago at space and they havent been back since

5456935 the device did not operate in terms of transmitting a signal because it found that particular channel was occupied
5456936 there would be zero chance of causing any interference to the signals because in that situation there certainly would not be a transmission of the signal in the first place

5456944 they dont believe that a disabled person should compete in the able bodied olympics because the paralympics are just as good
5456945 but before my accident i was an able bodied athlete
5456946 my brother was a swimmer and i used to sit on the side watching him i despised water and then one day when i was six i was sitting there and i said to my mom i can swim i jumped in i tried training and things went on from there
5456947 i was wearing a steel cap shoe there was only a dent in it
5456948 my leg burst open like if you drop a tomato on the ground
5456949 the bone burst through the skin that is why you see a big scar on the top of my leg
5456950 they were going to take muscle out of my back and insert it in there and try and add some length try to sort of piece everything together
5456951 they used this big exoskeleton to allign the bones but after four days it still hadnt knitted and i had been through 24 units of blood because they had to keep scraping away the dead tissue nothing was bandaged nothing could be sewn up
5456952 i remember asking my mom when are they going to amputate my moms answer was that they already had
5456953 i didnt know if i would be able to swim i didnt know how fast i would be able to swim i didnt know if i would be able to walk again breaststroke was difficult because i cant snap my legs together

5456971 since my involvement in the 1980 arnhem paralympic games the paralympic movement has grown tremendously i have always had a warm interest in the movement but the torino 2006 paralympic winter games were an eye opening experience for me it totally convinced me that i want to do my personal best for the paralympic movement
5456972 in 2005 i participated in an paralympic school day held in sweden which was lots of fun and very inspiring it is one of the wonderful initiative the paralympic movement created and i am looking forward to working with sir philip and the ipc to further help young athletes to develop

5457086 sie k nnen ihre vertragserkl rung innerhalb von zwei wochen ohne angabe von gr nden in textform z
5457087 gem 126b bgb erfordert textform dass die erkl rung in einer urkunde oder auf andere zur dauerhaften wiedergabe in schriftzeichen geeigneten weise abgegeben ist der sache nach verlangt diese vorschrift daher eine perpetuierung der erkl rung durch einen internetauftritt ist die perpetuierungsfunktion die 126b bgb fordert allein noch nicht erf llt denn der text verbleibt in diesem fall nur dann dauerhaft beim verbraucher wenn dieser aufgrund eigenen zus tzlichen willensentschlusses ihn ausdruckt oder abspeichert vom gesetzeszweck her ist es nicht m glich danach zu differenzieren ob es im nachhinein zu einer solchen perpetuierung kommt oder nicht denn die l nge der widerrufsfrist w rde sich dann danach richten wie sich der verbraucher verh lt bzw wie er technisch ausgestattet ist dies f hrte zu einer unertr glichen rechtsunsicherheit
5457088 wenn der gesetzesgeber fordert dass dem verbraucher eine belehrung in textform
5457089 bei verk ufen ber die auktionsplattform ebay ist eine ordnungsgem e belehrung des verbrauchers in textform vor vertragsschluss ausgeschlossen
5457090 hiervon abgesehen tritt die kammer zur frage der einhaltung der textform bei ebay verk ufen an verbraucher der zwischenzeitlich nach r cknahme der berufung rechtskr ftigen entscheidung des landgerichts flensburg vom 23 8 2006 mmr 2006 686 bei wonach bei fernabsatzvertr gen ber die internetplattform ebay der textform i s d 126b bgb gen gt sein d rfte wenn die notwendigen informationen f r den verbraucher im rahmen des angebots zur verf gung gestellt werden und der verbraucher die m glichkeit hat sie zu speichern und auszudrucken dessen schutzbed rfnis an einer dauerhaften verf gbarkeit der informationen wird dadurch hinreichend rechnung getragen dass er sich die informationen ohne besonderen aufwand ausdrucken und abspeichern kann zumal sie bei einem zuschlag kauf zusammen mit dem angebot noch 90 tage auf der ebay plattform gespeichert und f r ihn abrufbar bleiben
5457091 indessen enthalten die 355 ff bgb nur allgemeine vorschriften f r alle gesetze nach denen dem verbraucher ein widerrufsrecht einger umt ist speziell f r den fernabsatz ist in 312 c bgb n her festgelegt zu welchem zeitpunkt und in welcher form die widerrufsbelehrung mit dem in 1 abs 1 nr 10 bgb infov niedergelegten inhalt zu erfolgen hat die erf llung der informationspflichten nach 312 c abs 2 bgb hat in textform zu erfolgen und zwar bei waren darum geht es hier sp testens bis zur lieferung an den verbraucher 312 c abs 2 s 1 nr 2 bgb diese regelungen zur widerrufsbelehrung im fernabsatz sind als spezialregelungen zum zeitpunkt und zur art und weise der belehrung ber die rechtsfolgen des widerrufs anzusehen und gehen in ihrem anwendungsbereich 357 abs 3 s 1 bgb vor so auch lg flensburg mmr 06 686 687
5457092 nach auffassung des verfassers ist diese inzwischen wohl herrschende rechtsprechung zur monatsfrist
5457093 der verbraucher soll durch die belehrung nicht nur von seinem widerrufsrecht kenntnis erlangen sondern auch in die lage versetzt werden dieses auszu ben ein missverst ndnis des verbrauchers dar ber wann die frist in der er sein widerrufsrecht aus ben kann beginnt kann die aus bung dieses rechts beeintr chtigen m glicherweise meint ein verbraucher die widerrufsfrist sei bereits abgelaufen und bt das recht daher nicht aus
5457094 dass f r die wettbewerbswidrigkeit nach 4 nr 11 uwg ma geblich auf 312 d abs 2 bgb und nicht auf die anlage 2 zu 14 abs 1 bgb infov abzustellen ist ergibt sich zudem aus dem sinn und zweck der bei fernabsatzgesch ften vorgesehenen modifizierten widerrufsfrist die zus tzliche voraussetzung f r den lauf der widerrufsfrist in 312 d abs 2 bgb dass die ware beim kunden eingegangen ist dient dem schutz des verbrauchers um sicherzustellen dass dieser die im internet bestellte vor dem kauf nicht unmittelbar besichtigte ware vor ablauf der widerrufsfrist hinreichend pr fen kann dementsprechend ist der schutz von 14 abs 1 bgb infov zu versagen wenn sich ein fehler konkret zum nachteil des verbrauchers auswirkt
5457095 auf die schutzwirkung des 14 abs 1 bgb infov kann sich n mlich entgegen der vom olg hamburg ohne n here begr ndung vertretenen auffassung beschluss vom 12 09 2007 5 w 129 07 der unternehmer nur berufen wenn er dass muster unver ndert ausgenommen die umsetzung der gestaltungshinweise und die nach 14 abs 3 bgb zugelassenen weiteren angaben verwendet dies folgt daraus dass die verwendung des musters und nicht die einzelner musterbedingungen privilegiert ist weiter nderungen k nnen allenfalls dann die schutzwirkung unber hrt lassen wenn zu lasten des verbrauchers gehende unrichtigkeiten des musters berichtigt wurden
5457096 sind sich die verbraucher ber den beginn und l nge der widerrufsfrist im unklaren kann dies die aus bung des widerrufsrechts beeintr chtigen insoweit k nnte sich der unternehmer gegen ber anderen wettbewerbern eine wirtschaftlich vorteilhafte position verschaffen weil er der aus bung des widerrufsrechts durch verbraucher seltener ausgesetzt ist als andere
5457097 der gesetzgeber hat aber zum schutz des verbrauchers wie 8 abs 3 uwg zeigt eine konstruktion gew hlt die weitgehend von der pers nlichen betroffenheit des klagenden absieht denn nicht nur mitbewerbern werden die unterlassungsanspr che nach dieser vorschrift einger umt sondern auch institutionen die nicht am markt teilnehmen

5457105 the governor and his team have not given us the numbers needed for us to start making decisions
5457106 maybe its bigger than any of us have ever assumed maybe the governor is trying to hide what it is

5457170 a man on the street would say dont be ridiculous a natural feeling is of course that what we do we do of our own free will not completely but certainly to the point of knowing we can choose what button to push in an experiment
5457171 its kind of depressing when people cant communicate with each other
5457172 we know thats true in politics but youd think that wouldnt be going on here
5457173 as a determined determinist i would say that yes you bet an experimenters choice what to measure was fixed from the dawn of time and so were the properties of the thing he decided to call a photon

5457175 tim montgomerie its director said factual inaccuracies and mistaken assumptions have contributed to britons and europeans taking a hostile stance towards their most powerful ally which often acted against national interests

5457177 the survey showed that a majority agreed with the false statement that since the second world war the us had more often sided with non muslims when they had come into conflict with muslims
5457178 from 1973 to 1990 the united states sold saddam hussein more than a quarter of his weapons
5457179 they believe we all have two or three wives and or husbands and have historically as a nation never saw an opportunity to become involved in any war which would result in the killing masses of muslims

5457183 i am a christian and i am a devout christian i believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of jesus christ i believe that that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life but most importantly i believe in the example that jesus set by feeding the hungry and healing the sick and always prioritizing the least of these over the powerful i didnt fall out in church as they say but there was a very strong awakening in me of the importance of these issues in my life i didnt want to walk alone on this journey accepting jesus christ in my life has been a powerful guide for my conduct and my values and my ideals there is one thing that i want to mention that i think is important part of what weve been seeing during the course this campaign is some scurrilous e mails that have been sent out denying my faith talking about me being a muslim suggesting that i got sworn in the u s senate with a quran in my hand or that i dont pledge allegiance to the flag i think its really important for your readers to know that i have been a member of the same church for almost 20 years and i have never practiced islam i am respectful of the religion but its not my own one of the things thats very important in this day and age is that we dont use religion as a political tool and certainly that we dont lie about religion as a way to score political points i just thought it was important to get that in there to dispel rumors that have been over the internet weve done so repeatedly but obviously its a political tactic of somebody to try to provide this misinformation
5457184 we are at the bottom of the ladder in terms of having any influence with china
5457185 you want me to the tell the president of a country of 1 3 billion people you should do this and do that but i dont dare to say what to do to the premier of saskatchewan you have to put things in perspective

5457188 its 1 3 billion people and im telling you that they are moving fast you think that canada is very important in the world i remember when i was going to china the press saying mr chr tien you have to tell the president of china to do this and do that
5457189 you want me to the tell the president of a country of 1 3 billion people you should do this and do that but i dont dare to say what to do to the premier of saskatchewan you have to put things in perspective

5457192 of course tibet is a problem but tibet has been a province for them for a long long time to make the dalai lama an honourary citizen of canada was not a compliment to china
5457193 but for them the dalai lama is not a religious leader
5457194 i have to tell you that when you say resistant to change you should have been with me in 1994 when i visited china go to china today and youll see there has been a hell of a lot of change
5457195 the first western leader to make a speech about human rights in public in china at the university of beijing some people who say i never mentioned human rights they are completely wrong
5457196 you have to engage them you have to live with the reality they have if you gave the freedom of movement we give in canada today there would be 20 million people arriving in shanghai within a year how do you deal with 20 million refugees coming into one city its a very realistic problem

5457222 the memphis connection tour has a direct connection to what rhodes is all about
5457223 rhodes aspires to graduate students with a lifelong passion for learning a compassion for others and the ability to translate academic study and personal concern into effective leadership and action within their communities and around the world
5457224 this process begins with the memphis connection tour and continues throughout a students four years at the college
5457225 we hope seeing the vast range of resources available within the city of memphis will inspire our students to engage in some way as they pursue their academic studies at rhodes
5457226 i took the arts in memphis tour when i arrived at rhodes during welcome week says kristine overacre now a rising senior
5457227 i was able to meet art historians professors and gallery owners and as a result of this experience im minoring in art history since the tour i have continued to frequent many of the local museums especially the brooks last summer i interned at a gallery in my hometown of little rock arkansas
5457228 not only was i able to experience the religious practices of another faith during the visit to a local mosque the discussion we had afterwards helped me to better understand the role other cultures play in our daily lives especially in a city as culturally diverse as memphis it even made me look at current events in a different light the tour provided a memorable experience and provided invaluable information both of which i have carried with me ever since
5457229 we want to introduce students to the remarkable cultural traditions rich history and outstanding professional resources right here in memphis and we include in the mix the culinary traditions that have made the city famous
5457230 no tour of memphis would be complete without tasting authentic memphis barbecue thats included too
5457231 90210 remake theyre going to make us reporter folk actually wait to see it like everyone else

5457233 no one really knows enough about the use of cctv in schools its a very new issue we have set up a working group to look into the use of cctv and produce atl guidelines on best practice for schools and colleges throughout the uk
5457234 certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of cctv in schools and strict safeguards for its use although surveillance in schools can have some positive outcomes such as discouraging vandalism and violence we think there are some instances where it should be strictly controlled
5457235 students feel secure to know if there has been an incident such as bullying we can then go back and look what happened
5457236 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of this cease fire and should be removed immediately
5457237 the only forces that are permitted to remain under the cease fire agreement are the forces that were in there at the aug 6 time frame
5457238 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5457239 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5457240 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5457241 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5457242 if someone thinks that our citizens can be killed soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers killed with impunity we will never permit that
5457243 anyone who tries to do so will face a crushing response
5457244 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5457245 i wanted to be of service as this is an important event for china

5457276 quisimos agraciar a los que fueron oprimidos en la tierra y hacer de ellos imames y disponerlos herederos
5457277 en esa ocasi n los creyentes fueron puestos a prueba y sufrieron una violenta conmoci n
5457278 ciertamente que sobrevendr para la gente una poca en la que la verdad estar cubierta y la falsedad manifiesta y c lebre y ello ser cuando los de mayor preponderancia entre la gente sean sus enemigos se acerque la promesa de verdad se incremente la incredulidad y se manifieste la corrupci n entonces los creyentes ser n probados y sufrir n una violenta conmoci n los incr dulos les atribuir n calificativos de malvados y el esfuerzo del creyente consistir en resguardar su vida de quienes le son m s cercanos luego dios conceder el sosiego a sus amigos y el due o de la orden se manifestar a sus enemigos

5457299 it seems that labours unpopular plans for a national road pricing scheme are alive and well
5457300 they are determined to press ahead with their untried and untested spy in the sky national project even though it looks like an it disaster waiting to happen ruth kelly should start listening to drivers and scrap these pilots for a national road pricing scheme that is unnecessary and unwanted
5457301 if the government was true to its word and was kicking road pricing into the long grass why is it running trials
5457302 ministers have said that national road pricing is no longer on the agenda so either they are wasting millions of pounds of taxpayers money or they are not being honest with voters
5457303 we have been absolutely clear that any proposal for national road pricing would need to address the legitimate concerns people have
5457304 i look forward to working with you to further develop the bonds of good neighborliness that unite our peoples and nations and to deepen the friendly relations that so happily exist between the two countries
5457305 we hope that election of the prime minister removes the last barrier to speedy formation of a government constructive action on key issues facing nepal and a start on the difficult but necessary task of drafting nepals new constitution
5457306 we look forward to the new government delivering to the people to meet their expectations for a prosperous future and taking forward the peace process including through creating the environment for the drafting of a constitution that secures peace stability and democracy
5457307 it wishes that the peace process will continue through the concerted efforts of all political parties so that the happiness and prosperity of nepalis will materialize at the earliest

5457316 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud
5457317 the existence of an inner oort cloud has been theoretically predicted for many years but sq372 and perhaps sedna are the first objects we have found that seem to originate there its exciting that we are beginning to verify these predictions
5457318 there are bound to be many more objects like this waiting to be discovered by the next generation of surveys which will search to fainter levels and cover more area

5457334 one of the reasons the white house selected fallon for centcom was that hes known to be a strategic thinker and had demonstrated those skills in the pacific
5457335 he was charged with coming up with an over all coherent strategy for iran iraq and afghanistan and by law the combatant commander is responsible for all military operations within his a
5457336 when fallon tried to make sense of all the overt and covert activity conducted by the military in his area of responsibility a small group in the white house leadership shut him out
5457337 the coherence of military strategy is being eroded because of undue civilian influence and direction of nonconventional military operations
5457338 if you have small groups planning and conducting military operations outside the knowledge and control of the combatant commander by default you cant have a coherent military strategy you end up with a disaster like the reconstruction efforts in iraq

5457364 terrorists do not understand america the american people do not falter under threat and we will not allow our future to be determined by car bombers and assassins
5457365 the principal task of our military is to find and defeat the terrorists
5457366 and that is why we are on the offense and as we pursue the terrorists our military is helping to train iraqi security forces so that they can defend their people and fight the enemy on their own our strategy can be summed up this way

5457371 and so while i want to be a faithful and wise steward concerning preparing for those rough times ahead i feel very much like an ignorant child who has not a clue how to do that i know a little and i do it but so much i dont know i sometimes beat myself up for those things i dont know but that is foolish i just read tonight that we must become as a little child and i trust that part means that we must live life like he is our father

5457505 we do not disregard irresponsible actions by the iranian government we also oppose atomic weapons in principle and support the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction from the region however it is clear that the main source of the immediate danger of a new widespread war stems from the policies of the israeli government and the flow of threats from it backed by provocative military manoeuvres after serious consideration we reiterate our position that all the arguments for such an attack are without any security political or moral justification

5457531 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
5457532 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
5457533 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
5457534 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position

5457555 sin embargo la estaca era s lo un min sculo pedazo de madera apenas enterrado unos cent metros en la tierra y aunque la cadena era gruesa y poderosa me parec a obvio que este animal capaz de arrancar un rbol de cuajo con su propia fuerza podr a con facilidad arrancar la estaca y huir el misterio es evidente qu lo mantiene entonces por qu no huye
5457556 cuando ten a cinco o seis a os yo todav a confiaba en la sabidur a de los grandes pregunt entonces a alg n maestro a alg n padre o a alg n t o por el misterio del elefante alguno de ellos me explic que el elefante no se escapaba porque estaba amaestrado hice entonces la pregunta obvia si est amaestrado por qu lo encadenan no recuerdo haber recibido ninguna respuesta coherente
5457557 con el tiempo me olvid del misterio del elefante y la estaca y s lo lo recordaba cuando me encontraba con otros que tambi n se hab an hecho la misma pregunta hace algunos a os descubr que por suerte para m alguien hab a sido lo bastante sabio como para encontrar la respuesta
5457558 el elefante del circo no escapa porque ha estado atado a una estaca parecida desde que era muy peque o
5457559 estoy seguro de que aquel momento el elefante empuj tir y sud tratando de soltarse y a pesar de todo su esfuerzo no pudo
5457560 hasta que un d a un terrible d a para su historia el animal acept su impotencia y se resign a su destino este elefante enorme y poderoso no escapa porque cree que no puede el tiene registro y recuerdo de su impotencia de aquella impotencia que se siente poco despu s de nacer y lo peor es que jam s se ha vuelto a cuestionar seriamente ese registro jam s jam s intent poner a prueba su fuerza otra vez
5457561 cada uno de nosotros somos un poco como ese elefante vamos por el mundo atados a cientos de estacas que nos restan libertad

5457623 the new prime minister yousuf raza gilani who was in washington this week to meet president bush says he is doing his best to convince his country that this is pakistans war but he seems not to have won the argument within his own government
5457624 this complex situation calls for a careful and flexible response from the united states and to its credit the outgoing bush administration is making a relatively good start at fashioning that response
5457625 gillani on his first official us visit since being elected in february was left in no doubt that the bush administration had lost patience with the isis alleged double game
5457626 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5457627 the fact that we have young people over there who have u s passports is of tremendous concern because of their ability to come back into the united states
5457628 we have previously said that increased activity in the pakistani tribal areas gives us some reason for concern
5457629 we have also previously talked about our concerns that al qaida is seeking to recruit western looking sympathizers with no criminal records who could more easily blend in and attempt to travel to the united states
5457630 no credible information at this time to suggest an imminent threat to the homeland or u s interests at the olympics
5457631 i understand there is a problem of extremism at some madrassas
5457632 but to put everyone under this broad net of suspicion is beginning to infringe on peoples civil liberties
5457633 michael mccauls failed publicity stunt shows it is past time for new leadership in texas 10th congressional district
5457634 a nice sound bite that trivializes a very serious issue for this country
5457635 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5457636 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
5457637 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
5457638 and asked about leaked information that tipped militants to surveillance efforts by western intelligence services
5457639 thats probably something the government of pakistan ought to speak to
5457640 we and some of our allies have evidence not only from the scene of the explosion but evidence beyond it that unfortunately indicate a hand like that
5457641 we are fairly confident of what you are talking about
5457642 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5457643 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan
5457644 carrying what were seen as india influenced intelligence inputs had hardened the resolve of pakistans security establishment to keep supreme pakistans national security interest even if it meant straining ties with the us and nato
5457645 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
5457646 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
5457647 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006
5457648 the united states military has the capacity to direct a missile to a precise location at very short notice as it has done close to 20 times in the last few years to hit al qaeda targets inside pakistan
5457649 have long been intrigued by the presence of highly encrypted communications gear with mehsud this communication gear enables him to collect real time information on pakistani troop movements from an unidentified foreign source without being intercepted by pakistani intelligence
5457650 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5457651 there is a cold war between india and pakistan they say hands off kashmir we say hands off afghanistan
5457652 there is just enough pakistan co operation with the us to get away with it
5457653 but the us agenda is not innocent either they desire a larger role for themselves in the muslim world
5457654 the isi is going to determine the destiny of pakistan perhaps in the near future
5457655 during the afghan jihad so many things were created by pakistan now these elements are out of control
5457656 the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too
5457657 some rogue elements in the isi are working against the interest of the country they are being funded by a terror sponsor state the us
5457658 anytime the supreme court called the interior ministry or the defense ministry they could not get the isi into the court
5457659 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5457660 we have received information that nearly 800 militants are waiting to cross over to india at the borders
5457661 the wired fencing at border areas is being further strengthened
5457662 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5457663 mullah rahmatullah tried to show that the afghan government is weak in kandahar
5457664 after the arrest mullah rahmatullah confessed to his crimes and said he received orders and money for all terroristic activities and for the kidnappings from one of the members of pakistans consulate in kandahar
5457665 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5457666 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5457667 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
5457668 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
5457669 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
5457670 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
5457671 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5457672 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
5457673 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
5457674 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
5457675 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
5457676 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5457677 you are butchers liars and hypocrites you keep on talking about terrorism to the media but behind closed doors you support terrorism
5457678 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5457679 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
5457680 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
5457681 the united states is very keen that india become important
5457682 indias going to be doing what it wants to do in the area that china thinks is important and a more capable strong india will be able to prevent chinese hegemony more so than a weak india
5457683 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
5457684 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france
5457685 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
5457686 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
5457687 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5457688 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
5457689 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
5457690 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
5457691 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
5457692 this is not true we have no reports of missiles being fired into pakistan
5457693 it is not clear whether wazir survived the attack or not but his brother abdur rehman and one of their close relatives abdul salam were killed in the strike
5457694 they were three men who suddenly stood up during the meeting and one of them opened fire on him
5457695 if these kinds of operations continue against us in swat and in the tribal areas we will continue this
5457696 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
5457697 reiterated the resolve of the nation to remain determined and not yield to pressures created by such heinous crimes
5457698 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5457699 were being told by western envoys that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
5457700 we are very clear that we have no role to play in this impeachment process britain has no interest in talking about the fate of individuals
5457701 there is a link between musharraf and the army so humiliating him is like humiliating the army
5457702 the us administration would have much preferred to see a workable political arrangement between musharraf and the government not another looming transition
5457703 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here
5457704 this is a man who stood up against al qaida who will face al qaida after musharraf certainly not this coalition
5457705 the anti terrorist squad of uttar pradesh has arrested one isi agent of pakistan from rupaideeha in bahraich district we have come to know that his name is mohamad masrur alias manzoor ansari who is son of noor muhammad he is native of 154 4 garden west adul jabbar compound near nazeer hotel karachi
5457706 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5457707 extremists wanted to establish their hold in bajaur and the government had to take action
5457708 until today 462 militants have been killed in bajaur and a similar number have been injured twenty two troops have been killed and some are missing in action
5457709 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5457710 they dont realize they can succeed against me but the country will undergo irreparable damage
5457711 i will live and die in pakistan there is no other way
5457712 historians will not forgive musharraf he manipulated elections he hounded his opponents and he became a dictator its not much of a legacy
5457713 there will be a more balanced view of him in the future than there is now
5457714 a lot of things happened in pakistan for the good under his watch and i think that is something the history books will recall after some time
5457715 as far as democracy in pakistan is concerned historians will not forgive him
5457716 he manipulated elections he hounded his opponents and he became a dictator its not much of a legacy
5457717 he never tried to create an impression in pakistan that we were fighting for our own country and our own good
5457718 and because of that the pakistan army became a client army and pakistan became a client state in the eyes of the people it was a major failing on his part
5457719 he didnt understand that a country of 160 million people couldnt be ruled by just one man
5457720 we thought it might be good but it doesnt help us

5457725 ukraine is insisting the russian military must leave sebastopol when the lease on the base expires in 2017 the russian navy has made it clear it may refuse to do so
5457726 president musharraf made the critical choice to join the fight against al qaida the taliban and other extremist groups that threaten the peace and security of pakistan its neighbors and partners throughout the world
5457727 the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable prosperous democratic modern muslim nation

5457738 the games have not helped they have actually slowed down work that was progressing and increased abuses
5457739 the approach that beijing chose for the preparation of the games was to suppress any critical voices and to prevent these voices from finding an echo in the international media
5457740 they made that annoucement for the outside world but within the country they repress people
5457741 its clear that its because of the olympic games because we lost contact just before the beginning of the games
5457742 i was being followed and watched and the situation was very tense so i decided to leave
5457743 before the olympics the police authorities visited us and talked to the dissidents and they were prepared for their freedoms to be restricted during the olympics and from what we have seen so far many people have been followed or monitored
5457744 to date what had been announced publicly doesnt appear in reality to be happening and a number of questions are being asked
5457745 the ioc is keen to see those questions answered by the relevant authorities

5457768 while i can believe the promise of god because it is his promise and because he is my god and while i can trust my saviour because he is god and therefore mighty to save all goes well with me but i do find when i begin questioning myself about this and that perplexity thus taking my eye off christ that all the virtue of my life seems oozing out at every pore any practice that detracts from faith is an evil practice but especially that kind of self examination which would take us away from the cross foot proceeds in a wrong direction

5457881 the memphis connection tour has a direct connection to what rhodes is all about
5457882 rhodes aspires to graduate students with a lifelong passion for learning a compassion for others and the ability to translate academic study and personal concern into effective leadership and action within their communities and around the world
5457883 this process begins with the memphis connection tour and continues throughout a students four years at the college
5457884 we hope seeing the vast range of resources available within the city of memphis will inspire our students to engage in some way as they pursue their academic studies at rhodes
5457885 i took the arts in memphis tour when i arrived at rhodes during welcome week says kristine overacre now a rising senior
5457886 i was able to meet art historians professors and gallery owners and as a result of this experience im minoring in art history since the tour i have continued to frequent many of the local museums especially the brooks last summer i interned at a gallery in my hometown of little rock arkansas
5457887 not only was i able to experience the religious practices of another faith during the visit to a local mosque the discussion we had afterwards helped me to better understand the role other cultures play in our daily lives especially in a city as culturally diverse as memphis it even made me look at current events in a different light the tour provided a memorable experience and provided invaluable information both of which i have carried with me ever since
5457888 we want to introduce students to the remarkable cultural traditions rich history and outstanding professional resources right here in memphis and we include in the mix the culinary traditions that have made the city famous
5457889 no tour of memphis would be complete without tasting authentic memphis barbecue thats included too

5457909 a strategy that cannot be implemented or resourced is not a strategy but rather a critical failure in leadership and management it is nothing more that a statement of hopes and good intentions without credibility
5457910 a canadian colleague said we have created a strategy of co option we are trying he says to bring as many nations as possible into the fold of cooperation by offering benefits much as the us did in the post wwii era when it stitched together the grand system of alliances to counter an expansionist soviet union
5457911 today the implied benefit in the maritime strategy is that the us will act as a status quo power and itself operate within the confines of the system via this implicit promise the sea services have written a policy check to the world that future administrations may or may not cash
5457912 similarly the press the maritime strategy is getting in china is more positive than that emanating from inside the beltway given a choice i would opt for plaudits from the prc cooption may have a shot

5457941 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5457942 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5457943 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5457944 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5457945 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5457946 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5457947 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5457948 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5457949 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5457950 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5457951 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5457952 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5457953 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children

5457965 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5457966 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5457967 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5457968 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5457969 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5457970 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

5457976 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5457977 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5457978 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5457979 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5457980 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5457981 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5457982 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5457983 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5457984 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5457985 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5457986 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5457987 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5457988 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5457989 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5457990 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

5457993 i think we had to do something to be fair to the team and to be fair to olson trembley said
5457994 i told you he s the natural incredible he hit it like he knew it was coming he probably did he s had an incredible streak it s not for me to say it s for me to sit back and watch and appreciate it and enjoy it and for him to take all the credit in the world
5457995 melvin got a cortisone shot right before the all star break and the three days rest allowed the shot to work we talked about it a lot when he came back after the break he seemed to think that they hit the right spot that coupled with the rest that he had the three days he just took off i ve seen melvin hit the ball really really good before i ve seen him have a season in which he hit 27 28 homers i ve seen him have a season in which he 340 for us but this bit of a streak right here this is as hot as i ve seen him it s been six weeks now
5457996 man it s been awesome even his outs are hard he s become one of the best third basemen in the league in a matter of two months everything he s hit has just been whacked it s like whatever he wants to do he s doing it right now i ve never seen anybody this hot before in my life
5457997 if only the orioles had some kind of offense they might be able to really accomplish something
5457998 she basically choked ill be honest with you she choked
5457999 she didnt think or thought too much about what she had to do she was to be confident enough to know that she did this overseas several times im not out there to know what the pressure is like but for her to get that much pressure where she false started over seven other athletes i dont think she should have been doubling
5458000 you cant tell an athlete what to do when its a psychological sport
5458001 you have to let them learn from their own experiences and i think she learned now that in major championships she shouldnt be doubling
5458002 in the quarterfinals my start was really bad and i got jittery in the blocks and didnt get out good after false starting the first time
5458003 in that run the starter held the set for a while and that threw me off a little bit which it shouldnt have on the restart after false starting i lost my composure my feet started trembling and when the gun popped i was out of my race so it was over from the start
5458004 in the 100 you have to be technical have a good start know how to start get out be relaxed and gun it
5458005 i wasnt able to execute i guess my nerves got the best of me again not every time ill have a good race but unfortunately at the olympics i didnt have a good start but i know for my dominant race i dont need such a dominant or quick start and ill be more prepared for that
5458006 he just put it out on the table and laid it out to us
5458007 it was a real eye opener it really showed me its not only basketball and baseball
5458008 the first round felt really easy i got out of my drive phase and after my drive it was like i stopped running almost like you are relaxing to that point
5458009 i felt like l was in front or no one was really close but toward the end i realized there were two people on the inside of me i wasnt sure who they were but more like christine arron and lauryn williams to my knowledge so i was making sure i got top three so i could qualify for the second round
5458010 i still had it in me thinking i would do that
5458011 the first part of the race felt fine i didnt feel the fact that my body was out of position i was just trying to stay relaxed and drive the foot down but the girl inside of me 2004 olympic champ yuina nestsiarenka just kept going and i couldnt keep up with her my practice rhythm is fine but when i get out on the track and try to transfer it over im having a little trouble doing that
5458012 in the second round she did not do what she did technically before to put herself in position to run she got out and never really got up to accelerate off the drive phase
5458013 as a result when the ladies were able to move she wasnt able to move she stayed in that position the entire race and that pretty much was detriment
5458014 what ive experienced this time is selection they have the people they think are going to make it and most times your heats are drawn that way
5458015 when youre in the stadium they call out the top three that they think are going to qualify and they neglect the rest of the competitors which is fine
5458016 but the atmosphere was nice and the support was great so i cant complain about that
5458017 the people were nice the races are great so i guess i can enjoy other things outside of my downfall
5458018 i fell short of the national record but what i gained in experience i wouldnt trade it for the world
5458019 i got to the stadium about two hours before the competition and worked a lot on visualization breathing just staying focused on the task at hand
5458020 i got out there and felt good im pleased about it the coaches are also pleased i have something really positive to build on for next year
5458021 i know what i have to work on for next year and i cant wait
5458022 it was humbling this is by far the biggest meet ive ever been to
5458023 i expected to be a lot more nervous but surprisingly through a lot of talking with coach willis todman and being able to stay focused and relaxed on what i had to do i didnt get out of my zone so to speak i was able to calm the nerves go out there and perform at a good level there were thousands and thousands of people looking at you and saying hi but at the same time i was just focused on that ring the discus and what i had to do i felt i did a good job today accomplishing that

5458035 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5458036 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5458037 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5458038 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5458039 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5458040 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5458041 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5458042 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5458043 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5458044 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5458045 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5458046 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5458047 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5458048 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5458049 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy

5458061 i believe i performed great but my results werent where i wanted them to be
5458062 i wanted to be in the 90s but i did not get that opportunity i had been training in the 90s all week 590 to 595 but i hit in the 80s and didnt even check my score when it was over with because i wasnt in the finals
5458063 it was a great learning too bad im still learning at matches because we dont have too many matches in a year
5458064 shooting in this match was just an unbelievable experience to be with the athletes and feel match pressure like you never felt before knowing that when you hit that button you know youre at the olympics and five billion people are watching you
5458065 i would like to say that was match pressure or a little nerves taking me out which you can barely barely barely see in your sights
5458066 but if you hit a 9 9 its still a 9 i winked two shots from sight alignment but other that that it was 100 percent effort
5458067 we lost the lead for about two hours yesterday but we got it back today we tried not to listen to the radio and to what the other boats were catching our game plan was to just keep running with the ball and score as many touchdowns as we could after all this tournament is known as the superbowl of sports fishing its incredible and trust me not that easy at all to win

5458155 that does not mean that any landowner is not able to protect themselves and their property if they ever perceive that theres an issue with a mountain lion on their property absolutely not they do not need to have that hunting license to protect themselves or the property at any time
5458156 it was a good finish from fernando i was just behind the shot and i could see exactly where it was going it was a great strike and it gave the keeper no chance
5458157 the most important thing is that we got the win we have had pre season and that was our first game in the league so it was good to get three points on the board and keep a clean sheet
5458158 we have to be happy with that but we have to look at what we can do better because there are many many things that we can do better
5458159 the next game is at home against middlesbrough on saturday so hopefully we will do a lot better then
5458160 it was tough for us at the start of the game they came out of the blocks really quickly and set a really high tempo which youd expect because it was their first home game of the season

5458367 weve been waiting for quite some time to make this happen and were really excited that its moving along and well get some houses fixed
5458368 both started fighting and i could not control them at that time i saw emile grab a knife from my kitchen with which he started stabbing neeraj
5458369 emile also threatened to kill me and raped me twice after the murder
5458370 emile then chalked out a plan to dispose of the body at about 3 pm he took the body to the bathroom and started cutting it into pieces
5458371 i say that emile had killed grover in front of me

5458374 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5458375 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5458376 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5458377 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5458378 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5458379 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5458380 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5458381 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5458382 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5458383 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5458403 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5458404 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

5458408 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5458409 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5458410 rebecca is 28 shes old enough to make decisions to do things like that
5458411 she did talk to me about it and it was tastefully done and they air brushed out the underwear that she had on
5458412 she was determined when she won her first sports race at school when she was four or five she got a sticker for coming first
5458413 she was certainly good at swimming and could have had the opportunity to take that further
5458414 and she played hockey at school but i dont think anybody recognised or picked up that she had a particular talent at sport
5458415 she just went out one day having checked in the yellow pages for a water sport because we are not too far from the river and came back home and said she had joined kingston rowing club
5458416 a few weeks later her coach came round and said she had got real potential and it was likely that she was going to go far
5458417 i dont think she made any assumptions about that she just thought she would give it a go
5458418 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5458419 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

5458582 there are certain rules that drive the spectator to be sad or happy minor chords for sadness and major chords for happiness

5458609 part of the challenge is that there are 25 states with breach notification laws
5458610 if you look at each of them you will see that each one is slightly different and that does cause challenges it creates the requirement that if you are doing business across states you have to go through and try to rationalize them across states
5458611 nobody wants to become really good at knowing how to notify when theres a breach

5458677 our nearest competitor did about 1 62 lakh last fiscal year
5458678 we import almost 85 per cent of our coal requirement from china the chinese coal and coke prices have risen almost 150 per cent over last one year we have already started looking at other coal rich nations
5458679 we import mainly from australia and have long term contract with nmdc we are also having a coal block in mozambique
5458680 however the decision would add to the continuing raw material scarcity as coal and related fuel will cost more
5458681 this is a welcome step particularly for the indian it bpo industry
5458682 there seems to be a complete market failure as our subscribers are denied advanced value added services in contrast to world scenario where such internet based services are very popular
5458683 customers will ultimately benefit from cost effective and innovative internet telephony service
5458684 the trai has recommended that std service providers would be connected to internet service providers through a public internet network both the service providers would ink an agreement for connecting the calls details of which have to be mutually sorted out it said
5458685 recommendations are against the very basic principle of level playing field since they allow unrestricted internet telephony to isps at no additional cost
5458686 large numbers of indians are now downloading games using their mobile phones and with 3g availability of free games would become wider

5458689 in the us and europe broad access to media and entertainment has been available for decades through a large fixed distribution infrastructure and more recently in specialised devices like bipods to meet consumers entertainment needs

5458703 its a dog its ok you can get another one relax
5458704 things changed at the start of the second half saturday night at toyota park fans in brand new no 20 jerseys sat up straight section 8 quiet much of the first half suddenly found its voice a sense of electricity pervaded the nearly sold out stadium only the score didnt change
5458705 brazilian midfielder fred scored on a 27th minute header as united 9 9 1 atoned for last sundays 4 1 loss at new york earned its second shutout in three league matches and snapped a seven game unbeaten streak by the fire 9 6 5
5458706 one goal proved to be enough as united held on for the win thanks in no small part to the play of crayton the liberian international signed with the team friday and started his first mls game saturday in his debut crayton collected a win a shutout and made two saves
5458707 mcbride went to work immediately after entering he won headers at midfield and in the penalty box and narrowly missed out on an assist when andy herron drifted a shot over the crossbar in the 48th minute
5458708 the two big talking points will be louis craytons outstanding if understated performance and the officiating
5458709 clyde simms would be nice if he stopped giving the ball away sometimes though
5458710 there was a shifting of the gears that seemed to take place in my head during this match rather than dreading the inevitable moment of madness from the united defense that would lead to chicago sticking one in the net i was expecting a big play from blanco or mcbride to do the dirty deed thats a massive psychological shift when you worry about the other team having to do something rather than your own defense tossing up the mandatory brain fart
5458711 as for crayton he did a good job there were several times when i was like oh crap but about half of those he was fine it was mostly my leftover zach wells angst coming through crayton made me worry a few times aside from the wells related things but he never really let us down i expect if he can keep this up that once he gets to know our back line hell do better i mean he cant be worse than wells at this point and if nothing else he kept a clean sheet our second of the season
5458712 id like to say this was one of the worst mls officiating performances ive ever seen but ive seen too many mls games
5458713 what has happened to my fandom have i lost the faith
5458714 the job of all revolutions to make permanent their gains
5458715 economics are the method the object is to change the soul
5458716 she sees her mission as nothing less than eradicating labour party socialism as a political alternative
5458717 have to dismantle the governments bloated wasteful and unjust spending enterprises or risk national ruin
5458718 if the public thinks government is wasteful thats fine that reduces public faith in government which is precisely what the republicans want
5458719 over the past 30 years american politics has become more money centered at exactly the same time that american society has grown more unequal

5458755 were all in this together and the people of pakistan and the government of pakistan know that
5458756 so were confident that while we certainly all have more to do when it comes to fighting terrorism the government of pakistan will continue in the effort
5458757 while this political process is under way we certainly expect theyll keep up their fight against terrorists and extremists and because of what i just said this is a fight that they are in as well
5458758 thats what the prime minister said when he was in washington
5458759 president bush is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5458760 president bush appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaeda and extremist groups
5458761 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5458762 the extremist ideology is one that has been out there and among these groups for many years
5458763 lets be very clear about where this started and thats with the extremists
5458764 a friend to the united states and one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5458765 in addition a large majority 69 per cent of the experts considers pakistan the country most likely to transfer nuclear technology to terrorists
5458766 in 2007 10 per cent of experts named the iraq war as the greatest threat to us security in may 2008 not a single expert did
5458767 the first thing that he will do when he returns home is to focus on his health since he is fairly old
5458768 it sells people contraception that often is ineffective so when it fails its customers can return and demand medical treatment
5458769 no woman can call herself free who does not own and control her body no woman can call herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a mother
5458770 no one can doubt that there are times when an abortion is justifiable abortions will become unnecessary when care is taken to prevent conception care is the only cure for abortions
5458771 the women are now as crude and violent as the men great is that progress
5458772 my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military we have an epidemic here women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq
5458773 when you are over there you are lower than dirt you are expendable as a soldier in general and as a woman its worse
5458774 the best way to understand a rapist is to think of him as a torturer who uses sex as a weapon to degrade and destroy his victims
5458775 many american troops in iraq have deliberately shot children raped civilian women and teenagers tortured prisoners of war and abused their own comrades because they see no moral justification for the war and are reduced to nothing but self loathing anger fear and hatred
5458776 uos club team is full of players that were recruited from high school to play for their d1 team but didnt make it making them the most successful womens lacrosse team in the northwest
5458777 this unfair advantage makes them extremely hard to compete against
5458778 with that the skill level has been drastically increasing which amazes me every year
5458779 we have realized that we can play on their level and that we are good enough to keep the score even last season we were tied with them until the last 30 seconds of the game so they only won by one
5458780 during the fall and winter school terms we practice for about 6 hours a week mostly working on our conditioning and introducing new players to the sport
5458781 this is an important development time for the new players and old players to meet and get used to playing with each other in spring term our season starts and we end up going to tournaments almost every weekend
5458782 after going through a hard day of training in air force rotc the best thing i can imagine is going to lacrosse practice and letting all of that built up stress go
5458783 the laid back yet competitive atmosphere is what i really like about it
5458784 we have made it our personal goal to beat uo and go to nationals
5458785 hate to be responsible for turning multani into ins and having him deported
5458786 if they dont have any setbacks in practice i think they both will play and have a limited pitch count dungy said
5458787 cynthia mckinney green party candidate for president and rosa clemente green party candidate for vice president are not participating in any recreate 68 activities both candidates and the green party of colorado are refuting this announcement and are stating that neither candidate nor the green party of colorado are in any way associated with recreate 68 nor will any of their candidates be speaking at or attending any event nor are they in any way associated with the group recreate 68
5458788 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
5458789 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
5458790 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
5458791 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
5458792 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
5458793 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
5458794 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
5458795 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
5458796 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
5458797 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
5458798 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
5458799 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
5458800 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
5458801 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
5458802 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
5458803 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
5458804 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
5458805 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
5458806 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
5458807 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
5458808 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
5458809 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
5458810 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
5458811 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
5458812 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

5458821 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
5458822 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
5458823 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
5458824 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
5458825 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
5458826 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
5458827 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
5458828 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
5458829 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
5458830 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
5458831 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
5458832 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
5458833 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
5458834 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
5458835 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
5458836 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
5458837 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
5458838 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
5458839 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
5458840 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
5458841 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
5458842 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
5458843 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
5458844 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
5458845 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
5458846 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
5458847 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
5458848 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

5458860 the history of free men is never written by chance but by their choice
5458861 whatever a person frequently thinks and reflects on that will become the inclination of their mind
5458862 if the goal exists to prove that we are worthy to cover our insecurity or to conquer others it will ultimately prove unfulfilling and come to an unhappy end and yet the very same activity can be done in a healthy way with dedication commitment and love
5458863 if i were to begin living as if i were good enough and deserved love and satisfaction respect and all good things i would this doesnt have to have anything to do with food let your imagination wander and make as long a list as you can

5458878 our two biggest concerns at dsr are that we allow todd to recuperate fully and that the team perform well for all the sponsors
5458879 its been a major burden on rockstar energy drink dodge tuner phil shuler whos been pulling double duty to also tune the mopar oakley dodge and the other dsr crew chiefs who have lent their support
5458880 we welcome richard on board its going to take some heat off of phil and release him from his duties of trying to tune both cars we know richard has a ton of experience everyone on the team and at dsr wishes todd a quick recovery
5458881 i havent been real active in funny cars for a while
5458882 but it will help to work with a team thats already in place while trying to fill in for todd and take some of the pressure off phil
5458883 its always a challenge coming in the week before the u s nationals or any race and trying to familiarize myself with the team and everything thats involved especially when there is no testing permitted the first run is critical in indy because its a night run you do get a second night run shot there on saturday but there will be a lot of cars at that event so its a tough place to start
5458884 it was definitely an experience and one i will never forget thats for sure we will take our eighth place finish and try to better prepare ourselves for duquoin in two weeks

5458888 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the u s
5458889 id say 100 million over the course of his lifetime
5458890 one gold medal is amazing two is well incredible three practically unbelievable but eight eight gold medals thats thats well well were going to need some new adjectives for whatever that is congratulations michael
5458891 we continue to evaluate post beijing activities that will allow us to reinforce our relationship with michael
5458892 its huge its the opportunity that no startup generally gets
5458893 with opportunity obviously theres a lot of responsibility for us to take advantage of it properly and do it in a way that not only benefits the company but also benefits michael
5458894 we are currently evaluating opportunities to build upon this excitement however a final determination about our future plans has not yet been made

5458897 observes that white privileged and respectable identity builds itself by being able to enter places of degeneracy and come out unscathed willing and ready to tell the tale
5458898 lets just say there are plans in place to deal with this
5458899 what they are i am not at liberty to disclose but we will not stand for the f ing signs being removed it may be very amusing for you british but f ing is simply f ing to us what is this big f ing joke it is puerile
5458900 the germans all want to see the mozart house in salzburg italians and russians always celebrate new year here every american seems to care only about the sound of music filmed around salzburg in 1965 the occasional japanese wants to see hitlers birthplace in braunau but for the british its all about f ing
5458901 here we have tranquillity clean air lakes acres of forests and some of the most breathtaking vistas one could imagine
5458902 yet still there is this obsession with f ing just this morning i had to tell an english lady who stopped by that there were no f ing postcards
5458903 it was a bit of fun that didnt hurt anyone but i found out that in this region you just cant do something like that
5458904 the whole thing became a real trial for me and i had to stop people are very traditional here
5458905 i am no longer the mayor so this f ing problem is nothing to do with me
5458906 there was even some discussion about changing the name because it has become such a serious issue
5458907 but everyone decided that f ing had been here for so long that it would be a shame to consign it to the past
5458908 a shocking turn with the demise of one of the shows leading characters
5458909 presiden bush tetap pada komitmennya bagi pakistan yang kuat yang melanjutkan upaya upayanya memperkuat demokrasi dan memerangi teror
5458910 presiden bush menghargai upaya upaya presiden musharraf dalam peralihan demokratis pakistan serta komitmennya untuk memerangi al qaeda dan kelompok kelompok ekstrimis
5458911 presiden bush berharap bekerja sama dengan pemerntah pakistan dalam tantangan tantangan ekonomi politik dan keamanan yang mereka hadapi
5458912 we are back playing but we have to take into account which players are reasonably match fit sharp and ready to play
5458913 as rangers found out the lithuanians are well into their season and we have players who havent had as many competitive matches as we would have liked
5458914 as we stand this is effectively our game in hand and if we win that we would be level with denmark and two points behind finland
5458915 but all we need to do is to win the next game its as simple as that if you dont do that then nothing else matters
5458916 garry and mark have been the defensive partnership in the last few games and have done well
5458917 we have lost steven naismith to a long term injury and steven fletcher has moved up to the full squad so thats two goal scorers and two centre halves out but its the type of thing that happens
5458918 in that situation you try and get people who will surprise you and do just as well and maybe even better than the players who have dropped out
5458919 we have cover at the back in scott cuthbert and andrew considine
5458920 andrew has been unfortunate not to get the start with us because he has been holding down a first team spot at aberdeen and playing well and scott now has the opportunity of first team football at st mirren
5458921 the good thing is that the ones you ask to step in have been with us for a period of time and they know all the boys who are in the squad
5458922 i wanted to come first in the semis that was always the plan so im happy with that i feel fine and it was comfortable
5458923 its all going according to plan so far its bloody hard work but thats what its about thats why i have been training so hard
5458924 this means everything to come back from all the heartache and prove to myself i can be number one
5458925 please buy this product only if you meet the prerequisites if the shoes do not fit we cant be responsible if they hurt your feet
5458926 its a pretty incredible feeling to be standing in victory lane after the race
5458927 my biggest feeling after winning the race was relief that the first win had finally come i have put a lot of pressure on myself and the guys in the shop have been so supportive about everything this season
5458928 we had the lead and the 5 car dustin skinner was right behind us pressuring and he didnt slow up in time going into turn one and he got into us i dont think that he did it on purpose we went around for a spin and all i could think was there was no way that i am going to get my spot back
5458929 i have to thank my crew they have really poured their hearts and souls into this effort
5458930 i woke up sunday morning to a few text messages from him martin
5458931 he was telling me how proud he was of me it was pretty cool to know that he was doing this before he got in his car at michigan for the nascar sprint cup race we are already talking about the next race though we celebrated that night and now were focused on the next race after winning one race we are hungrier than ever to do it again

5458935 digital nomads are growing in numbers and they will create ripples accelerating the use of web 2 0 technologies in the workplace over time they may have some effect on marketing channels potentially slowing the efficacy of e mail marketing and accelerating the reliance on social media engagement in marketing

5458940 hell as social control is an idea made up by modernists and post modernists who think there shouldnt be moral consequences for actions
5458941 because hell is invisible people have no way of deciding for themselves whether its real and because hell is such a grotesquely appalling consequence people will do anything to avoid it therefore if you can convince people that hell is real and that you are an authority on its existence and what they have to do to avoid it you can make them do anything

5458952 he said that would be really devastating to our mission
5458953 determining what happened in history when it is a foreign nation and something we had nothing to do with is not the job of the united states congress its a job for historians the bottom line is at this time in 2007 and 2008 and possibly in 2009 it is the last thing to throw in the face of one of our few allies in the middle east

5458959 may not really be aware of the genocide they are helping to deny
5458960 the u s congress and adolf hitler on the armenians
5458961 i share your view that the united states must recognize the events of 1915 to 1923 carried out by the ottoman empire as genocide as you know this resulted in the deportation of nearly 2 000 000 armenians of whom 1 500 000 men women and children were killed

5458966 hond en kat wat leuk samen maar verkering moeilijk omdat jij je ziet er leuk uit dus moeten er rijen voor je deur staan
5458967 ja ik moet steeds maar kiezen tussen al die rijen mannen die voor mijn deur wachten en dat is verdomde lastig
5458968 nou dat valt wel mee hoor ik hoorde laatst dat ik enorm
5458969 schijnbaar zie ik flirten als een beetje leuke conversatie met een glimlach en pretoogjes en pik ik nooit het serieuze flirtgedrag eruit
5458970 ohw zo mij werd verweten dat als je mij niet kende dat ik flirtte maar nee ik ben gewoon aardig tegen iedereen het wordt gewoon verkeerd uitgelegd het is echt zo maar jij hebt het niet eens door dus
5458971 dus reageer je ook niet of voel je wel eens iets als jij je ook aangetrokken voelt
5458972 ik voel het wel als iemand ineens verdomd lastig en eng gaat doen
5458973 zo iets waar bij je nekharen omhoog gaan staan gewoon eng maar anders heb ik het gewoon gezellig totdat ze ineens je weer proberen te zoenen of je broek uit te trekken dan zit je weer bij belevenis nummer 1 nekharen omhoog en kippevel en dan vaak niet het plezierige soort
5458974 dat snap ik nooit zo mannen denken vaak dat als je amicaal bent dat je met ze wilt zoenen etc
5458975 dat het niets is hij niets kan en het ook nooit wat wordt
5458976 je moet altijd bij de standpunt blijven als je ergens zeker van bent en jij hebt wel al die wijsheid in pacht

5458978 the problem with defending the purity of the english language is that english is about as pure as a cribhouse whore we dont just borrow words on occasion english has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and rifle their pockets for new vocabulary

5458980 the congregation have been lied to people were crying at the service were going to step up our campaign and take a three pronged approach
5458981 talks have failed and were going to step up the campaign and we hope to join other groups campaigning to save churches across the country
5458982 we also plan to march to westminster cathedral with our petition which already has 4 000 signatures and 130 people have already pledged to march
5458983 we are also contacting the charities commission to ask them to investigate the use of church funds
5458984 this is the saddest day in new brightons history weve already lost a lot of our heritage we cant afford to lose an iconic building like this
5458985 they never once asked the congregation for the money needed for the building work we could have raised it we were offered pledges of 10 000 and 15 000
5458986 this is a popular wealthy church with a large congregation we should be keeping it open
5458987 they have ignored the parishioners and already started stripping out the assets which will make it harder to reopen
5458988 we will keep on fighting and hope the cardinal of westminster will join our campaign
5458989 even if the diocese wont provide a priest we still want the church open for the community to use

5459002 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
5459003 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
5459004 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
5459005 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
5459006 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
5459007 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
5459008 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
5459009 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since
5459010 people with happy families dont become spies a bad childhood is the perfect background for covert ops you dont trust anyone youre used to getting smacked around and you never get homesick
5459011 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
5459012 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
5459013 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
5459014 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
5459015 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
5459016 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
5459017 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
5459018 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
5459019 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
5459020 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you
5459021 her weirdnesses have the quality of life in a trailer park during tornado season someones shih tzu just blew in through the window pfft theres a buick parked on the ceiling bah old man parsnip just got blown right into the anal cavity of a standing cow cest la vie her life is managed in clusters of riot interrupted by the occasional errant moment of calm
5459022 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
5459023 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30
5459024 i am way more afraid of forgetting how to be happy alone than i am actually ending up alone
5459025 various medical authorities swarm in and out of here predicting i have between two days and two months to live
5459026 you know marcel proust french writer total loser never had a real job unrequited love affairs gay spent 20 years writing a book almost no one reads but hes also probably the greatest writer since shakespeare anyway he uh he gets down to the end of his life and he looks back and decides that all those years he suffered those were the best years of his life cause they made him who he was all those years he was happy you know total waste didnt learn a thing so if you sleep until youre 18 ah think of the suffering youre gonna miss i mean high school high school those are your prime suffering years you dont get better suffering than that
5459027 no phil he just wants her to spend the next six decades wracked with terrible soul crushing guilt
5459028 in real life if april was not told she would never ever ever forgive her mom for not giving her the opportunity to be with her grampa when he died instead of at this godawful mistake of a wedding
5459029 on another note how does phil know jim doesnt want liz to know its not like he can tell her and he probably didnt bring the picture board considering that this might be the last chance to say good bye he might actually want his family there
5459030 it was very prescient of liz to include on the picture board a graphic depicting
5459031 ive had another heart attack but dont let that stop liz from marrying her high school sweetheart even though she rushed ahead with the wedding just for my sake i dont want to ruin her day
5459032 the entire patterworld has been conspiring to get these two hitched since they were so high and theyre not going to let something like an old mans ill health get in their way he can jolly well wait his turn and read his preprinted thank you note like everybody else
5459033 you know this makes a nice little commentary on the lizthony relationship an assault brings them together again and a death marks their wedding day
5459034 everyone is dressed grouped together in one area and just about to leave they could just as easily go to the hospital as the ceremony location and look there just happens to be 6 whole limousines with drivers which could carry virtually every wedding attendee
5459035 i thought that jim would at least make it to the ceremony before taking a turn for the worse once i saw todays it became obvious that we would never see the attack happen like that wed just jump to the aftermath how could i forget that lynn does not show important things happening she saves her showing entirely for things like robin or edgar digging up the yard
5459036 but wait what do you want to bet that the cranes crows whoever have a gift wrapped harmonica as a wedding present from lil jesse and that will give liz something to fondly remember about her gramps and everything will be okay fine then
5459037 its like you have a camera in my home lynn
5459038 liz is pretty much the definition of dense but i dont think even shes dense enough to not realize that jim and iris are missing at the wedding
5459039 they can wait till liz and anthony are getting ready to leave for the honeymoon to share the news about grandpa jim that should set the right mood
5459040 i think that was this foob script teaches us is that rather than planning your wedding so that some dying relative can live to be there on your special day that way said dying relative cant ruin the day with all that inconvenient deathbed crap
5459041 in what must be a parallel universe what else can it be given all the contradictions retcons and general mess of this sunday strip we have the standard wedding plot of everything kinda trying to fall apart at the last minute tomorrow we will return to earth 1 and the death watch over grandpa jim
5459042 please tell me lynn is not callous enough to make elly not notify her kids of whats going on i know i know i could answer my own question there
5459043 its going to be sold to us as respecting jims dying wish i promise the pattersons are saints because they respected jims dying wish we are all haters because we expect the pattersons to disrespect jims dying wish gosh we are all so evil
5459044 even if we didnt know all hell was about to break loose lizs comment guarantees the weddings about to go to shit in a major way
5459045 ok by my reckoning four adults must have agreed to keeping this secret phil elly iris and john im assuming elly told him since he was right there when she got the call if were to believe that jim came up with this himself and managed to communicate that it makes five i can believe one person thinking its a good idea two maybe but four or five bull
5459046 meanwhile no one has noticed that elly and john havent climbed into the limo
5459047 she can make an exception this one time because she could care less about the old man trying to ruin her big day as
5459048 bueno si no es en esta ocasi n otro d a ser
5459049 and he said nothing could get a girl transferred they all felt something but i felt nothing except the feeling that this bullshit was absurd
5459050 on the day that i died and they laid me in the ground where was everybody they couldnt be found im gone and they dont know my name no plaque no speech no hall of fame
5459051 because felix i dont have to tell you that there are all kinds of dangerous diseases out there like aids and what not

5459053 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5459054 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan
5459055 it might be good for your asian and african childrens self esteem to know you support
5459056 now go back to making your movies about women who love to handle big guns that shoot hundreds of people to death

5459082 google has launched a free music search service in china the pilot program sifts through licensed tunes hosted by mainland site top 100 to deliver streaming samples and full downloads the service filters tens of thousands of local songs by title singer and album google invested in top 100 last year and plans to split associated advertising revenue with the platform and music labels the company said the newly launched platform reflected an effort to monetise and legitimize the chinese music sector where an estimated 99 per cent of all music files are bootleg copies
5459083 the internet industry should by no means stand in the opposite camp against the music industry google always believes profoundly that mutual interest rather than monopoly is the key to sustainable growth
5459084 google china president kai fu lee said in a statement

5459098 in this conversation you asked her if anyone else hurt her
5459099 in fact when this came up she said she did not know the names of those two men is that true

5459114 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5459115 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5459116 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5459117 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5459118 if pakistan becomes a more fragile and even failing state then the nuclear assets will be everybodys problem internationally the best way to prevent that from happening is in strengthening the new governments ability to govern

5459125 we have to deny russian strategic objectives which are clearly to undermine georgias democracy to use its military capability to damage and in some cases destroy georgian infrastructure and to try and weaken the georgian state
5459126 we are not going to allow russia to draw a new line at those states that are not yet integrated into the trans atlantic structures
5459127 to clearly indicate that we are not accepting a new line
5459128 is a very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5459129 this is not something that is just cost free nobody needs russian strategic aviation along americas coast
5459130 und wie f ngt man jetzt also den roten fichtenkreuzschnabel

5459140 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
5459141 i think it makes him temporarily feel better hes either hurt or has gotten hurt otherwise he wouldnt have gone out of his way in talking to the media
5459142 perhaps you didnt understand the last time i told you to stop contacting me
5459143 he wants to feel that hes in charge and that hes making all the decisions
5459144 jen will never kiss and tell but its she who ended the relationship
5459145 mayers childish behavior only confirms she was right to dump him now hes acting like a spoiled child expect jen to behave like a lady
5459146 he tips them off he loves the attention jen didnt want to believe it was happening but it was and she has no tolerance for that
5459147 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obama s varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5459148 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5459149 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5459150 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5459151 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5459152 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5459153 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5459154 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5459155 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama
5459156 i dont want to see the dying homeless woman laying by my fence
5459157 why spend more time than necessary reading on your computer screen print out your favorite content in a time tested elegant format
5459158 we cant be those guys we have to be ourselves
5459159 we have to find a way to make it work and embody the whole team concept being the dallas cowboys and not how they did it out there in new england
5459160 as long as we kick the egos out the door and come together as a team well be fine we have enough names to really do whatever it is we need to do but theres a flip side to that youve got enough names to take us to the next level and youve got enough names to tear this thing down
5459161 like ive been saying the only name that really counts is the dallas cowboys
5459162 we have a lot of names we have a lot of egos
5459163 one thing that we have done is try to put those things aside when you have a lot of names on the defensive side of the ball or the offensive side of the ball everywhere really the only name that matters is the dallas cowboys if we can get all that pride and ego out the door and come together as one we can be a force there are so many things are going on there is so much potential for distractions in order for us to be where we want to be we have to set aside those things
5459164 the patriots they epitomize the whole team concept those guys are all about team and thats it were not them we are a team that has a bunch of names a bunch of personalities and a bunch of youth we are learning what it takes to win at the right time
5459165 there are seats that we could have would have should have liked to have candidates for
5459166 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

5459182 e depois de perdoar me poderia preparar me um lugar em sua casa onde eu possa morar para sempre
5459183 e o senhor poderia viver dentro de mim e me proteger e me guiar e me aben oar com muito mais do que eu jamais mereci
5459184 ajude as pessoas a crescerem e eu farei a igreja crescer
5459185 thats the appeal isnt it youve got a blank canvas its sort of the purest form of what we do managing playing lists and recruiting
5459186 and to have that in a short period of time i mean its a once in a hundred years perhaps so its a really exciting prospect
5459187 we will now use scotts departure to evolve our recruiting process and structure this will see the commencement of a new chapter in our recruiting strategy for the club
5459188 the trouble is in picking him i have not seen any bowler like this he is an unusual bowler the only option right now is to play more and more of him thats the only way of getting better
5459189 even if you pick him by the time you realise what ball it is it gets really late to play a big shot you will see batsmen who can play him but in one day cricket it is not only about playing him you have to rotate the strike because you dont want a bowler to end up with ten overs for 20 runs
5459190 we will need to find a way by which we can rotate the strike if not play big shots you cant score 180 or 200 and look to defend that you have to get a decent score for which we will have to score off each and every bowler
5459191 murali and mendis are different bowlers murali can turn the ball on any wicket he loves sri lankan wickets
5459192 even when he bowls fast he gets some purchase out of the wicket no other spinner would have got so much turn
5459193 its important to get a good start in the last two games we lost quick wickets when you are playing mendis you have to save wickets and get the runs as well
5459194 it gets a bit tough with time batsmen will get used to it even murali sometime back was difficult mendis is a bit more unusual than muralitharan
5459195 to start with we misread the wicket a bit we did not think it would seam or swing that much
5459196 there was a fair bit in the wicket to start off the sri lankan bowlers bowled really well they got the first two batsmen out it was not like the batsmen played bad shots and got out credit goes to their fast bowlers
5459197 whatever fits the team best we will decide on that

5459200 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
5459201 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity
5459202 the initiative may spark a fresh and multilateral talk in the region
5459203 early measures to resolve frozen problems in the region and prevent instability in the future
5459204 this is our understanding on all problems we are no enemy to anyone in the region
5459205 we need to protect our modern lifestyle we dont want very religious or conservative people to govern us
5459206 some people worry that ataturks revolution is in danger but i think people who are used to modern life will never return to the age of ignorance
5459207 no one can be denied his or her right to a higher education
5459208 having such a diverse group of motivated and intelligent young activists each with different backgrounds and experiences really added to the richness of this years internship experience
5459209 i think theyve gained a lot not only from working in the office but also from one another and im sure they will go on to be true torchbearers for our cause well into the future
5459210 come my children but in any case do not live like us
5459211 the decision was taken to enable citizens of the turkish republic to attend the september 6 game between the football teams of armenia and turkey to be played in yerevan
5459212 we still have no information about how many turkish football fans would like to attend the game
5459213 we have received no applications from the turkish football federation yet
5459214 the government and the ffa are taking all necessary measures to prevent incidents during the march
5459215 there are millions of americans who under the reported new parameters could become subject to arbitrary and subjective ethnic and religious profiling
5459216 to put in place regulations that will allow the fbi to transform itself as it is transforming itself into an intelligence gathering organization
5459217 profiling muslims or arabs will just make al qaida look outside islam for its bombers there are many other disgruntled groups aside from those that worship allah
5459218 any new justice department guidelines must preserve the presumption of innocence that is the basis of our entire legal system initiating criminal investigations based on racial or religious profiling is both unconstitutional and un american

5459221 lets not wake up to the danger too late we need to be ever vigilant theyve taken yoghurt feta and baklava weve lost d ner and helva too none of these are known as ours anymore
5459222 baklava is turkish we will not allow greek cypriots to feed it to the world
5459223 feta cheese can only come from greece any other cheese that remotely resembles this delightful fare is really only an imitation and cannot be called anything other than white cheese
5459224 if you know anything about food then youll know that yoghurt was without a doubt invented cooked up made produced whatever you want to call it in turkey
5459225 it was in greensburg kansas that another dimension of the west opened up the force of a tornado to rip out a town the debris was still piled high nearly one year after the tornado of may 4 2007 i could only think of the billions of dollars going to rebuild iraq after the us bombed it the billions going to the corporate friends of the bush family still there was hope and abundant love in this town as the people were rebuilding green focused on solar and wind power and sustainable gardening
5459226 when the ra na decided to send peacekeepers to iraq zhamanak was the first to trample the armenian government in the mud this newspaper used to pretend patriotism in the soviet period now it completely surrendered to the turkish pressure
5459227 that our president has given a positive reply to the invitation is definitely an important step but more important than that is establishing a dialogue between the two peoples the turks and the armenians we are not politicians but we will be in yerevan on september 6 in the name of peace and friendship fifty of us will be there to form a bridge but hundreds of us will follow in the near future
5459228 some ears might not perceive karlens and eriks voice as a strong one but to us their voice is one free from hatred and enmity we were deeply impressed when we read the interview in which these two strong and self confident young people from armenia expressed themselves and the way they look with hope to the future without denying the past
5459229 as karlen and erik pointed out no matter what words you utter to describe those events in history they would not alleviate the pain caused by them
5459230 traumas can only be overcome through mutual understanding having close contacts sharing the pains and listening to each other
5459231 for historians too voice an official rhetoric just as politicians do
5459232 we have begun for some time debating about our thoughts freely in turkey the biggest problem between the turks and the armenians is just a lack of a healthy and full fledged communication we members of the two societies might begin a dialogue by detaching ourselves from politics we truly do not need official ideologies anymore
5459233 lets recall the past years when we turks and greeks came to the brink of war because of the kardak rocks just some small rocks on the aegean sea but today we are extending olive branches to each other and again becoming immersed in each others songs
5459234 so why shouldnt such normalization take place in turkey armenia relations as well within ten years for instance i see no obstacles to that
5459235 there in that stadium we shall stand shoulder to shoulder together with our friends from the armenian community of istanbul and we shall altogether cry out for peace and friendliness in fact we shall be hugging each other in that stadium as hrant would do if he had lived
5459236 bloggers are free individuals and can write what they want and how they want in their blogs
5459237 in any event this is how my voice gets heard i see that i can assist in making changes
5459238 the blog is sort of like my notebook everyday i jot down things and in order not to lose those references and themes i put them in my blog in addition i see the comments of my readers
5459239 today in armenia theres a very active blogger community and they are active outside the borders of the internet as well apparently these people are active citizens with a definite orientation
5459240 the issue is that political circles and people in general have started to seriously think about transferring their activities to the virtual arena
5459241 blogs are news sources this became apparent after the previous elections and one of the reasons for their development is perhaps the growth of the internets popularity in armenia
5459242 when somebody starts to work at something others join in also
5459243 the role of the blogs in terms of information will only grow with time following the example in western nations the influence of bloggers on political social and cultural life will increase such long term prospects are quite realistic
5459244 in my estimation bloggers are in the 30 40 year old range that are users of the internet and more or less belong to the middle class consequently their opinions cannot possibly reflect the views of the society at large however due to the fact that bloggers are active not only in the internet but in their daily lives has attracted a great amount of attention to the blogs
5459245 according to information at my disposal the national security service attempted to offer money to people or to coax individuals to start up blogs covering certain specific pre election topics or to publicly chide certain candidates
5459246 i dont know if getting paid to run a covert ad is ok or the opposite there was the case of a top economist who ran a blog and received a rating later on he published a few negative blurbs about a certain company as a result the shares of that company dropped drastically the firm went bankrupt and closed its doors afterwards the blogger was taken to court and during the trail he confessed that he had taken money from a competing company
5459247 we must understand that for example the people following livejournal came from the forums they are the same names the same photos they simply migrated from one network to another more up to date one
5459248 a news outlet blog creates a feeling of kinship with the reader also they cover issues that arent written about in the main pages on the paper
5459249 when news reporters run their own blogs firstly they gain recognition and furthermore the news outlet undergoes a process of socialization
5459250 the advantage of the blogosphere lies in its diversity however one still encounters personal insults and the use of uncivilized language
5459251 in general issues and problems related to the life of homosexuals are raised in the pages of gay armenia
5459252 i dont consider myself a blogger in the classical sense im more a carrier of the traditional media but it seems to me that all of this must be consolidated all reporters must see what is taking place in the blogs as a source of material
5459253 it is the human subjective factor thats important for me in the blogs and it is precisely this that differentiates blogs from the news outlets
5459254 i find that blogs are already competing with the news outlets but that this fact isnt fully comprehended this is clearly evident when the activities of the blogs and news outlets are compared side by side heres a fairly crude example our news outlets dont operate from friday evening till monday afternoon many news stories that take place within this time frame can only be found in the blogs at the very least the blogs are way ahead of the armenian media on these off days
5459255 one writes about politics another about her female musings and another about knives or automobiles the interests vary one writes because of the lack of real contact the more varied the society the greater the difference in the blogs the more numerous the colors the better
5459256 sergei never denied that he was an armenian but he also never felt that he needed to change his surname he was so busy producing works of art that he could not find time to make an identity analysis
5459257 sergeis creativity was something stunning his hands were always busy whatever material he had in his hands hed begin to give a form to it turn it into a work of art if it would be a stone then hed begin to chip it

5459259 rwanda all the media say where the killers and instigators including us are and yet the whole business carries on the information is factual but it doesnt reach any conclusion the consensus provides the excuse of collective vileness through this general knowledge
5459260 in constantinople the words pogrom ghetto inquisition had no meaning
5459261 the muslim population of the city was tolerant or indifferent towards jews
5459262 king ferdinand could not be as clever as reputed if he expelled so many industrious subjects to enrich a rival monarch
5459263 closely linked to the janissaries whose finances they alone had been said to understand the jews suffered from the blessed event
5459264 the apparent shift of product listings away from ebay and toward amazon and ebays decision to sharply discount listing fees heading into the christmas season indicate that competition is driving the cost of listing a product on a platform toward its marginal cost which is of course zero
5459265 we want to be the most price competitive marketplace on the web
5459266 the marketplace has been overwhelmed with identical often poorly priced items that have diluted the magic of the ebay experience
5459267 between now and the holiday season well do more to support your success and ensure we are price competitive in every key category the intent of all this change is obvious we want great stuff and great deals on ebay new used and collectibles please stay tuned for more pricing information on the announcement board later this summer

5459343 i was sitting down having a cigarette and he spotted me and made a beeline to me
5459344 i had a chance to go back to tennessee a chance to do some different things
5459345 but playing in my home state being there for my family my in laws i have a brother here in orlando my dads in tallahassee my moms in lake worth and i went to school in gainesville and grew up tallahassee so this is home
5459346 it always feels good looking across from you and seeing guys you actually played with guys that you watched growing up
5459347 we have a lot of love for them in that locker room
5459348 the opportunity to be here and to play in front of these fans play in front of a lot of the same gator fans i played in front of college its a blessing
5459349 especially at this point in my career to be so close to where i started
5459350 who knew kevin carter first got in the league when i was 13 14 years old
5459351 i actually played with kevin my rookie year now 14 years later were on the same nfl team so anything can happen
5459352 i played in a lot of defenses and had a lot of fun doing so
5459353 but i think this is probably one of the best situations ive ever been in defensively as far as the scheme and how we play defense here its just a lot of fun
5459354 we cant have wasted time so were just trying to make sure our plan is in order
5459355 in case the weather is bad we cant have those wasted practices wednesday plans on being a double and then were going to finish the week the right way
5459356 the chemistry that i think was lacking a year ago i dont feel that this year well find out when it gets tough during the season
5459357 my biggest concern is right now we have to have these practices
5459358 weve got one tuesday which is going to be a hawaii scrimmage its all going to be ones versus twos and twos will actually run hawaiis defense and kicking game
5459359 i saw him even getting up in the pounceys a little bit which shows his strength because everyone here knows what the pounceys can do were excited to have him back hes easing into it
5459360 he has all the potential in the world hes still gotta lot of in shape issues but hes got all the potential and the tools to be a great player here
5459361 i know hes been struggling with an injury and coming out of high school so highly recruited its hard on someones ego but hes always kept a level head and everything and i know it was really good for him to be out there
5459362 i was very disappointed at this point last year but he had a great spring
5459363 the dorian munroe injury set us back quite a bit but ahmad has done well he graded out a champion at our first scrimmage hes a natural football player i wish he was a little bigger taller and a little faster but hell get himself in the right position
5459364 last year we went through a lot of ups and downs and we kind of went into a dark room
5459365 we didnt know what to expect now we know what to expect and we feel like we have a lot of experience
5459366 were doing a lot of things out there that we didnt do last year
5459367 instead of when a guy makes a mistake or something like that were not downing him but were not ignoring him were telling him to get it going and stuff like that a lot of players on defense last year had never played with each other but this year weve played a whole season together guys are comfortable with each other guys are stepping out of their comfort zone telling other guys to step it up and thats how chemistry is built
5459368 things could be going better but im still going pretty hard
5459369 its hard to get a complete evaluation were still very much in the gray area whether hes going to play or redshirt so weve got this week and next week to really make that decision so its a really important time weve got to get him back to health
5459370 hed have no chance believe me no chance if he would have just got here this summer

5459379 from very early on the first christians discovered that the church was to be shaped and its mission and life taken forward by the work of people who were called to write about jesus and about what it meant to follow him in his kingdom mission the new dispensation the messianic age did not mean the abandonment of the notion of being shaped by a god given book but rather its transformation into something new new genres and themes developing out of the old but this already indicates that the bible was not something detached an entity apart from the church simply standing over against it the bible as we know it old and new testaments was from the first part of the life of gods people and remained so as it was read in worship studied in controversy and made the basis for mission but this did not mean then and does not mean now that the bible can be twisted into whichever shape the church wants at a particular time you cant say as some have tried to say the church wrote the bible so the church can rewrite the bible paul would have had sharp words to say about that as would the author of revelation from very early on all the more powerful for being implicit and not yet much thought through we find the first christians living under scripture that is believing that this book is its peculiar gift from its lord through the work of his spirit designed to enable the church to be the church which is of course not a static thing but to be the church in mission to be sent into the world with the good news of gods kingdom through the death and resurrection of his son and in the power of that same spirit
5459380 i set out to do that but to put it into practice and actually do it is another thing

5459388 but new people can bring so much to us and we want to do as much as we can to encourage them to keep working for the kaar and the community and to always be better at what they do it is also a way to encourage new members to be more active in both the association and their communities
5459389 you will never have more time than when you are new to volunteer and everybody brings in good information all of that together is what makes us a better organization

5459394 but goddamn it use your loaf woman like she followed up with im only coming back to scotland because i
5459395 amp that time i will be honest its about time we were
5459396 my dad was fucking raging i was actually pretty miffed but hell the guys fucking nuts anyway my dad had taken away his control amp he couldnt handle it like its all about
5459397 excuse has risen again much to my amusement she aint seen shit but im still planning not to see her this trip back either even if it does mean i have to sneak around with my dad like were having an affair
5459398 five years ago we took orders it was which one do you want and when do you want to close thats all we did but now in order to be successful you have to be different from every other agent out there
5459399 its a low pressure way to introduce people to what is out there and for people to learn more about the process of buying one of these homes
5459400 i thought we would be overwhelmed with calls on it and the response was anything but
5459401 borrowing against your 401 k is a very dumb idea
5459402 number one is the opportunity costs of borrowing you end up losing the tax deferred growth potential when you take the money out of your 401 k and the interest you pay back on the loan is unlikely to earn as much of a return as your 401 k investment
5459403 im seeing a lot of people touch upon their retirement accounts for down payment money
5459404 whats going on from a lending perspective is that lenders are requiring a much larger down payment than they did a year ago preferring 20 down accepting 10 down with mortgage insurance but prices are coming down on homes there is a willingness to tap into retirement funds right now real estate in a depressed market i think its a great investment
5459405 there are some clear risks of using a 401 k as a funding source for a down payment on a house you have to assess those risks and weigh them against the particular economic opportunity you have to buy a home under normal circumstances i think borrowing from a 401 k to purchase a home is ill advised but because of whats going on in the real estate market special and exceptional opportunities do arise
5459406 in the short term the interest may outperform the stock market but it is very unlikely that the interest is going to outperform the stock market over the length of the 401 k investment
5459407 job security is important absolutely what is your contingency plan in the event you become unemployed how are you going to pay the taxes
5459408 you cannot stop saving toward retirement just because you bought a house
5459409 you are giving up free money that would come in the form of the employer matching contributions if you are unable to make contributions
5459410 my advice if you cannot afford the home without the 401 k loan dont buy the home
5459411 the problems in the mortgage market have put the nations housing in a downward spiral that will be hard to break
5459412 the common thread linking their successes is their collective ability to anticipate trends and to manage change in their local marketplaces
5459413 all three of these top producers see the problems challenges and uncertainties in todays marketplaces as opportunities for tomorrow
5459414 successful agents are doing all the right things working hard and not letting the naysayers affect their attitudes about business we talk about mindset and positive attitudes in my organization its a huge part of our business when our market becomes more normal were going to be way ahead of the curve
5459415 we average about 800 internet inquiries a month and thats keeping my buyer brokerage very busy and very happy
5459416 our market is very neighborhood specific home prices have gone up in some neighborhoods and down in other neighborhoods some areas will simply take longer to recover
5459417 overall weve been very hopeful for a good summer in terms of whats in escrow and whats in the pipeline
5459418 i feel that were going to have a fabulous year
5459419 my job was to sell our city as a destination and show people a great lifestyle not simply sell them a home
5459420 i have surrounded myself with smart people who know a lot about the internet and search engine optimization seo
5459421 i put together an awesome website and was one of the first realtors in the greater phoenix area to utilize it prospects could go online without having to sign in to search properties this really worked out for me in 2003 2005
5459422 plus i dont have to pay an seo company because of the quality of leads im getting through househunt
5459423 we had nine closings in may and expected to have at least eight more in june at press time my six member team charlotte premier realty partners closed more than 22 million in gross sales volume last year our goal in 2008 is 38 million
5459424 when i first started i did all the recommended mailings to homeowners and spent thousands of dollars on advertising but that wasnt very productive
5459425 i was a single mom at the time with a real estate license but no income i was floundering househunt called me and offered me an internet territory i thought i cant afford to spend 400 for it my mother looked at me and said youve got to do something so i went ahead and purchased my first website i bought two more sites soon after then five more the rest is history
5459426 i answer my phone i return phone calls and i keep in contact with my clients and prospects on a regular basis
5459427 people need to understand that internet leads often take three to six months sometimes even two or three years to culminate in a transaction
5459428 you have to be on top of your game or youre not going to make it you cant forget your past client base it is a good source of referrals
5459429 it gives me an opportunity to renew acquaintances and meet people that i otherwise wouldnt have met
5459430 these people already think im a great guy and talk me up to their friends and co workers this is simply good business
5459431 sometimes you have to sacrifice a deal because you know it isnt the right thing to do
5459432 if you live your life that way and if you truly come across as a person who cares you will get plenty of business
5459433 my background is in the nightclub bar and restaurant business
5459434 so im used to taking care of customers you work hard to make them happy people get to know you and trust you if you say you are going to do something they know that you will actually follow up and do it its also knowing what people expect and delivering a little bit more every time
5459435 with nearly 80 percent of buyers searching the internet first before contacting an agent its critical that you be online thats where the business is
5459436 another key is to be able to respond within 15 minutes when you get an internet lead when you get a lead with a phone number you have to drop everything and call them back otherwise they will probably forget you
5459437 real estate is really a game of numbers patience persistence and communication
5459438 with each lead i receive i do two contacts a week for 10 weeks
5459439 a friend of mine has a saying shake their hand gain their trust and a month later you will get their business it works for him and makes sense to me
5459440 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title

5459443 bobbys an athletic guy that has had success rushing the quarterback
5459444 as we all know weve got to affect the quarterback more with our front four than we did a year ago weve got to be able to put some pressure on that guy and disrupt his timing and when you look at bobby and look at sedrick inside those two guys are going to help you
5459445 when you start with a new team you have something to prove
5459446 you dont want to keep dwelling on what youve done in the past if you just come in lackadaisical theyre going to feel like youre a bust and you dont want to have that on your shoulders
5459447 they think im probably just a slim defensive end thats just going to try to give you speed but im going to give you variety
5459448 i can mix it up i can beat you inside beat you outside i might run through you youve just got to be ready for it
5459449 we are particularly encouraged by the high gold contents of this recent drilling in pirata which is a new zone of potential for resource expansion the gold mineralization is associated with a swarm of late stage calcite veining which occurs in a zone about 100 meters wide and is open along strike the pirata zone is outside the el espino area of mineral resource estimate calculations completed in february 2008 any significant copper gold mineralization found here will augment the resources being drilled in the main el espino project area we will continue to explore aggressively at pirata as well as on other parts of el espino and are aiming to complete an updated mineral resource estimate at the beginning of the fourth quarter of this year

5459509 we are glad to announce the fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth
5459510 our revenue growth was also due to stronger than expected performance of our 3g and smartphone products
5459511 however we foresee a highly competitive environment and challenging economic conditions in the coming quarters in order to compete in an industry with relatively low profit margins we are utilizing our engineering knowledge and experience to focus on offering middle to high end mobile phone products to our customers in july we decided to strategically restructure the gsm r amp d team by reducing our work force to 700 by the third quarter this optimization will allow us to focus on our mobile phone products offering which is our core business and improve our r amp d efficiency we estimate that the severance cost resulting from such restructuring will be approximately us 2 million and will be incurred in the third quarter of 2008 while the operating costs saved will be approximately us 3 million starting from the fourth quarter of 2008 we are confident of our long term profitability

5459514 d ifficulties with product adherence and the possibility of sexual disinhibition are important concerns
5459515 will need to be part of an integrative package that includes biomedical behavioral and structural interventions
5459516 a ssesment of such multicomponent approaches with moderate effects is difficult issues to be considered include the nature of control groups and the effect of adherence on the true effectiveness of the intervention
5459517 our results demonstrate that the most effective way of creating value is through growth both organically and through acquisitions however we are now at a crossroads
5459518 our ability to continue creating value within the trust structure is constrained as we cannot efficiently access capital to fund growth the non hazardous solid waste services sector is undergoing a period of consolidation particularly in the u s market and we anticipate significant opportunities that we need to be in a position to act upon in order to continue to pursue our strategic growth objectives we require an equity that reflects our financial and operating performance we also require a structure that does not limit our growth or our foreign ownership levels and a structure through which we can efficiently access capital markets we believe the conversion to a corporate structure is fundamental to the future success of our business
5459519 given our anticipation of significant acquisition opportunities especially in the u s non hazardous solid waste services market the tuck in acquisitions that we are continually negotiating and our organic growth requirements my fellow trustees and i have decided to reduce our distributions to unitholders in order to direct more cash flow towards investments in growth therefore effective december 1 2008 we are changing our distribution policy to a monthly distribution of 0 04166 per unit
5459520 the first half of 2008 has been significant for ur energy
5459521 i had a group of players that their whole entire football team had never won a bowl game and someone started complaining about if you never won one never tasted one you dont really understand the amount of hard work it takes to win one
5459522 if you never win a championship im not sure you play football its too hard
5459523 when you look in a champions eye they look different than a non champion instead of me screaming at them all the time instead of me yelling at them about becoming champions lets see one lets witness one
5459524 to think nba champion doc rivers takes time out of his own personal time to come speak to the florida gators
5459525 just think about that for a minute the video was phenomenal it was one of the best nights ive witnessed we had a good practice today
5459526 you have to have that intensity and passion for what you do
5459527 rivers is a big believer in chemistry and character once again its all about credibility when trace armstrong talks to our team its trace armstrong when you say he led the nfl in sacks hes played 13 or 14 years in the nfl all of a sudden you see them sit in their chair a little bit last night when doc rivers walked in instant credibility
5459528 hed tell us stories and hed swing his shoulder and it would come out
5459529 hes such a tough kid even at lakeland high school hed wait for it to come back in about 45 minutes swing his shoulder and go run the ball and you cant do that here
5459530 he was a non functional guy and his strength was lacking he had two shoulder issues and just a non functional player and now hes very functional
5459531 two years ago the defense had good chemistry and im starting see that im starting to see the enthusiasm guys kind of pumping each other up i didnt see that last year
5459532 hes a guy that can move back and forth swing from running back motion him out to be a receiver visa versa as a receiver and motion him into the backfield and run the ball
5459533 it adds so much more to your offense and adds so much more for the defense to think about how they have to defend a certain offense how do they defend guys how do they defend personnel groupings and thats what our offense does
5459534 we know what were here for we didnt want anything like that to happen
5459535 i hope chinese fans dont get the wrong impression that thats the way we play the game of baseball
5459536 that was the nature of the play if the ball was right there no one would have said anything but they cut the ball off its baseball and if they cant accept that its not my problem
5459537 my left shoulders still bad from having to run over catchers who were in front of home plate
5459538 the first play at the plate where we lost our catcher that was just hard baseball
5459539 but i thought the other slide was too high you do that in the states and youre ejected the umpire let the game get away
5459540 there is a lot of uncertainty with what happens in terms of capital raising and a lot of investors are in a wait and see mode
5459541 from a gse perspective as long as they get funding it does not matter at what price as they will just pass it on with higher mortgage rates
5459542 the bid to cover ratios were weak for all three bill auctions spreads werent uniformly bad however
5459543 the barrons story seems to be getting a lot of attention rightly or wrongly
5459544 i am honestly not getting what tmobile is doing this phone has the potential to be tmobiles iphone and tmo is just sitting on it any tech person knows this phone has great potential to be awesome so circulating info amongst tech blog sites and the like really isnt doing much we all know it exists and have formed our opinions already be they good bad or indifferent how about you tell the masses tmo the form factor has mass appeal it seem to have a sidekick ish form but with an easy to use potentially powerful platform satisfying the needs of the tween business person and techno savy person alike they havent released few enough details to leave me intrigued and wanting to know more nor have they released enough to have me drooling tmobile make it work
5459545 i thought things were still looking up and i was still limping around still in a brace and then being able to come out in that big game my first game back and get an interception i felt like wow
5459546 at the end of the day to go down like that again is just so frustrating then trying to listen to the game in the hospital and it was just getting more frustrating i was just going into a little mental slump i just had to climb back out
5459547 he wants to play all he says is coach i want to be the starter i dont want to be the nickel back put me in that starting lineup and ill show you what i can do so far hes done an outstanding job hes pressing joe haden and wondy pierre louis for a starting position
5459548 it hit me during the summer when the coaches were talking to the team
5459549 i was like i really am one of the old guys i feel like i just got here and it goes by just like this and when you come in they tell you that
5459550 being a junior already i was just like limping around and gimping around out there last year i forgot what it was like going through my plays as a true freshman last year i got hurt and here i am as a junior already and its time to step it up and get back on the field and get my spot back im healthy and im trying to do it all
5459551 i care not for a mans religion whose dog and cat are not the better for it

5459556 starting against the chiefs and coming in off the bench versus the seahawks orton won the competition without directing the offense to a touchdown or completing a pass of more than 17 yards his five preseason possessions resulted in two field goals and three punts
5459557 its a shame no one in chicago has any patience because in rex was just starting to make strides and well never know what he was truly capable of
5459558 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5459559 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5459560 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5459561 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5459562 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5459563 selling our innocent brothers and sisters to america for dollars
5459564 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5459565 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5459566 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5459567 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5459568 whatever one might say it may be difficult for the politicians to give him the indemnity
5459569 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint

5459571 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5459572 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5459573 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5459574 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5459575 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5459592 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
5459593 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
5459594 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
5459595 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
5459596 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
5459597 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
5459598 methadone can be important for patients when other drugs dont work
5459599 but unless the doctor has the training and resources to manage the patient properly hes going to get in trouble at a rate thats unacceptable

5459658 the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine mind no longer appears to be an accidental intruder into the realm of matter we ought rather hail it as the creator and governor of the realm of matter
5459659 i incline to the idealistic theory that consciousness is fundamental and that the material universe is derivative from consciousness not consciousness from the material universe in general the universe seems to me to be nearer to a great thought than to a great machine it may well be it seems to me that each individual consciousness ought to be compared to a brain cell in a universal mind
5459660 you do not come into this world to have a dream run without pain suffering without problems the more varied your experience the more learning from many mistakes the more valuable your lifetime

5459665 you always have a bit of an attitude an acerbic edge but you are ultimately reasonable and i appreciate it

5459675 obama was caught red handed in his attempt to deceive the american people when
5459676 i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade
5459677 so for people to suggest that i somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive and its an example of the kind of politics we have to get beyond its one thing for people to disagree with me about the issue of choice its another thing for people to out and out misrepresent my positions repeatedly even after they know that theyre wrong
5459678 we now challenge obama to either declare the two 2003 documents to be forgeries and call for an official investigation or else apologize for his four years of misrepresentation on the issue of babies who are born alive during abortions and for calling us liars

5459795 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
5459796 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems

5459826 i gave my cell phone to his family in the hopes of getting him to come in and talk

5459828 we need him to come in and talk with us

5459899 go tell the people that they are corrupt and that they are sinning and that i am going to have to judge them for their sins what i am going to do is i am going to use a group of people who are much more evil than you to destroy you
5459900 i dont get that i know that we are bad but you are going to use these people known as the babylonians i mean theyre the meanest most violent the most corrupt people i know they are cheaters and thieves you are going to use a people much much more horrible than us to destroy us god that doesnt seem fair in fact god we protest and we would like to say we know you are supposed to be just but that doesnt seem just at all
5459901 god i thought we had this deal you know every time i prayed you did what i wanted you to do well youre not doing that anymore whats going on
5459902 that doesnt seem fair god i thought it was always going to be good but its not so good and you could do something about it but youre not i dont quite understand

5459908 god i remember ive heard about your miracles ive heard about your power ive heard about your glory god i remember when you used to do this god do it again do it again
5459909 god came down from teman the holy one from mount paran selah
5459910 his gods glory covered the heavens and his praise filled the earth
5459911 god your splendour it was like the sunrise rays flashed from his hand where his power was hidden
5459912 plague went before him pestilence followed his steps he stood and shook the earth
5459913 the ancient mountains crumbled and the age old hills collapsed his ways are eternal
5459914 god i remember when you guided your people by fire and by a cloud and i remember when you fed us with bread from heaven and i remember when the waters parted and we walked through and i remember when you shook the earth and the walls came tumbling down and i remember when you used torrential rains to defeat the enemy and i remember when you used pestilence and plagues god i remember what youre capable of renew those deeds in our day
5459915 oh my goodness if this verse was ever for anyone it must have been for me
5459916 god i remember your glory and your deeds and your power renew them in our day i know youve done it before god and i believe you can do it again

5459919 i heard and my heart pounded my lips quivered at the sound decay crept into my bones and my legs trembled
5459920 my heart pounding on chest pounded my lips did this little deal my legs shook i realized that what god said is going to come to pass and its not going to be pleasant
5459921 this is not going to be a fun season a lot of innocent people are going to die probably me probably those that i love there is going to be a lot of bloodshed and i dont like it but i trust god even though i dont fully understand
5459922 the sovereign hand of god is doing something here god has spoken and so ill accept what he is doing as difficult as it is for me to accept
5459923 i dont understand and i dont like it and the babylonians should get theirs and we are getting ours and i still dont like it
5459924 yet i will wait patiently for the day of calamity to come on the nation invading us
5459925 i am going to wait and babylon theyre going to get theirs because god has said it to be so
5459926 though the fig tree does not bud and though there are no grapes on the vines though the olive crop fails and the field produces no food though there are no sheep in the pen and no cattle in the stalls
5459927 yet i will rejoice in the lord i will be joyful in god my saviour
5459928 even though the fig tree doesnt bud yet i will rejoice in my god even though there are no cattle in the barn yet i will rejoice in my god

5459934 we maybe put too many protections in well simplify our protections well be quicker throwing the ball
5459935 weve learned that wherever you are you watch on the biggest screen you can
5459936 the way we program march madness on demand making it available on any platform live is the ideal way to handle it
5459937 if i can watch it live on the computer i may watch it live and not watch it on tv 12 hours later
5459938 what makes sports so special is the live moment and not knowing what would happen
5459939 it would be difficult to argue for anything that would impact that
5459940 if i watched a great event live ill e mail 55 people to say watch this on tv
5459941 people said if we dont get baseball of cable it will be the death of the game
5459942 there was a discussion that if we put games on tv at all people wouldnt go to the ballpark
5459943 the mc says obama becoming president would be as surprising as jeezy rolling into the housing projects in his blue lamborghini
5459944 theres a new star wars movie and no one cares
5459945 warning if you click through the link there will be language that the times frowns upon
5459946 his only response was that he wanted to hang out there which was not a very compelling reason
5459947 they had stiff alibis or they were not in a position to take the material for purposes of this kind
5459948 your cars not starting right your battery may be going out
5459949 i had a group of players that their whole entire football team had never won a bowl game and someone started complaining about if you never won one never tasted one you dont really understand the amount of hard work it takes to win one
5459950 if you never win a championship im not sure you play football its too hard
5459951 when you look in a champions eye they look different than a non champion instead of me screaming at them all the time instead of me yelling at them about becoming champions lets see one lets witness one
5459952 to think nba champion doc rivers takes time out of his own personal time to come speak to the florida gators
5459953 just think about that for a minute the video was phenomenal it was one of the best nights ive witnessed we had a good practice today
5459954 you have to have that intensity and passion for what you do
5459955 rivers is a big believer in chemistry and character once again its all about credibility when trace armstrong talks to our team its trace armstrong when you say he led the nfl in sacks hes played 13 or 14 years in the nfl all of a sudden you see them sit in their chair a little bit last night when doc rivers walked in instant credibility
5459956 hed tell us stories and hed swing his shoulder and it would come out
5459957 hes such a tough kid even at lakeland high school hed wait for it to come back in about 45 minutes swing his shoulder and go run the ball and you cant do that here
5459958 he was a non functional guy and his strength was lacking he had two shoulder issues and just a non functional player and now hes very functional
5459959 two years ago the defense had good chemistry and im starting to see that im starting to see the enthusiasm guys kind of pumping each other up i didnt see that last year
5459960 hes a guy that can move back and forth swing from running back motion him out to be a receiver visa versa as a receiver and motion him into the backfield and run the ball
5459961 it adds so much more to your offense and adds so much more for the defense to think about how they have to defend a certain offense how do they defend guys how do they defend personnel groupings and thats what our offense does
5459962 hes playing fast hes playing strong hes playing like the player we recruited him as when he came here in the spring he was so tentative learning the plays playing slow hes fast now
5459963 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
5459964 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
5459965 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
5459966 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
5459967 you could lower your investment risk by purchasing a couple of spias from highly rated insurance companies
5459968 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
5459969 try calling vanguard and ask for advice it wont hap
5459970 try calling vanguard and asking for someone to give you advice it wont happen
5459971 try calling vanguard and asking for someone to give you advice it wont happen
5459972 with 800 choices you cant just throw darts we pick great etfs in 13 categories
5459973 wir haben zu wenig nach vorne getan deshalb kann ich mit dem spiel nicht zufrieden sein
5459974 we re ready to take care of our customers in the event that the worst occurs
5459975 our national catastrophe response team of expert adjusters will be dispatched to areas impacted by the storm to help customers secure shelter guide them through temporary repairs issue checks for immediate expenses and promptly compensate customers for property damage
5459976 we were originally scheduled to bring 360 beds on line each month beginning in july
5459977 due to our efficiency and the collaboration of partnering contractors architects engineers and the city of eloy cca effectively made an additional 680 beds available to california two months earlier than expected
5459978 the expertise of cca s real estate and site acquisition team coupled with the efforts of respected construction firm j e dunn have enabled us to not merely meet but to beat our own timetables for this historic project
5459979 from day one our goal has been to build a well constructed innovatively designed safe and secure facility that responsively meets the needs of our partnering customer and supports our commitment to the residents of eloy
5459980 several innovative practices are pushing the project forward at the current pace
5459981 for example the housing units are prefabricated shipped to the campus site and set up independently then the rest of the housing unit is built around the cell modules
5459982 we had projected completing this project in march 2009 even with our advanced schedules
5459983 entirely completing a new correctional project of this scale is not only time and cost efficient it puts the citizens of eloy and surrounding areas in highly anticipated fulfilling jobs sooner than expected that s a real benefit to local families and the community as a whole
5459984 we re excited to launch our denver wimax network bringing nth net business class internet connectivity and other services to the denver metro area as a growing market denver has been in our plans for sometime
5459985 we felt with the increased volume of visitors to the denver metro area for this historic event this would be the time to make our next generation network available in denver
5459986 its important for young guys to know they can come up big in those situations
5459987 hes been working with our hitting coach don long and is getting better he worked to get a good pitch to hit im sure it was a nice boost to get that
5459988 if we hang around long enough we have the ability to get it done
5459989 it was just a lot of pitches a lot of pitches
5459990 weve got to find a better way of economizing those pitches at some point
5459991 its not getting any worse but its not getting any better
5459992 its a little sore but i just think i have to keep doing my stuff between starts
5459993 we had some opportunities but you have got to give their left handed pitcher credit too
5459994 he really made the pitches he had to when we had men in scoring position hes probably their hottest pitcher right now it was a difficult battle
5459995 what do you think about when you go out and run for three hours
5459996 this proves nothing and you look like death on wheels
5459997 your body has now transitioned to eating its own muscle
5459998 the military will continue to fight and the political government will continue to negotiate the negotiations have to continue as it is now an issue of saving pakistani society from the hands of the taliban
5459999 it has very fragile public support it doesnt want to lose that public support by going hard after the militants but at the same time it knows it must do so
