5960000 that budgetary strategy runs the risk of diminishing our effectiveness as an accountability institution imposing a costly danger for government that problem areas in administration are not properly targeted
5960001 this year the impact of the efficiency dividend is just over 2 million which in our language and in a way the committee will understand thats about five performance audits a year
5960002 we are in the stages where the efficiency dividend is now no longer coming out of efficiencies but is impacting directly on programs that we are delivering
5960003 agencies that arent paying competitive wage increases are losing staff to agencies which are near the top of the pay pile
5960004 earlier this year i directed the department to clear a backlog of about 13 000 temporary skilled migration visa applications on hand since march many of which were outside the acceptable standards for processing
5960005 applications for temporary skilled visas are now being processed faster and more efficiently at three new dedicated centres of excellence established in perth sydney and melbourne to deal with increasing demand by australian companies for overseas workers to meet skills shortages
5960006 employers in australia have to cast a wider net to bring talent in or back in to the country
5960007 a collective effort to attract and retain talent particularly accounting and finance professionals in australia will help all employers and take some much needed pressure off the sector
5960008 if we dont win this game and we scrape into the eight is it really worth being there
5960009 its a milestone to make the semis and were going for some kind of record i think its 18 in a row but we want to finish as high as we can
5960010 well be disappointed if we dont finish in fourth or fifth spot
5960011 i read somewhere you would need 30 points and weve only got 27 points so we need to win two of our next three to be sure of it
5960012 the gold coast can still make it and a number of other teams can still make it
5960013 weve got our side back if you like on friday night for the first time in a few weeks and apart from stevie michaels knee i dont think theres anyone else who would make the side
5960014 its important to us to win start showing some cohesion and get on the train for the semi finals
5960015 having karmichael back and justin back and tunza carroll and greg eastwood just adds that much more to the team and i expect the team to be in top form on friday night
5960016 it is an urgent need as we tackle changes in the international economic situation as well
5960017 i was just trying to make sure i was in a good position keeping an eye on the board and seeing where everyone else was
5960018 im just coming here to win thats the aim for me
5960019 i dont even think about not having a leg and if i want to keep competing i will have to continue to qualify with the able bodied for me its not about the disability at all
5960020 it stratford is literally on my doorstep and 15 minutes away from where my parents live and where i was brought up and lived all my life
5960021 that would be quite something to come out on the track and compete in front of my home fans cathy freeman all over again
5960022 were playing for everyone involved in the club the playing staff coaching staff and mainly our loyal supporters who continue to turn up each week
5960023 it doesnt matter where we play last week it was freezing out at penrith and our fans were still there so hopefully we can give them a win
5960024 for us weve just moved on from it a few weeks ago so we just want to train and do our thing and thats all well worry about
5960025 obviously the guys coming in theres some great signings there and weve got a lot of young kids coming in as well who are outstanding talents and weve seen a few of them in first grade this year
5960026 the futures looking good but for us the playing group and the coach we want to finish 2008 on a good note
5960027 certainly theres not many players available now and theres certainly no other sonny bill williams floating around
5960028 but well be patient you never know whats around the corner and you never know what might pop its head up so well be patient and see what happens
5960029 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5960030 at first this morning he said he wanted to go to singapore then he changed his mind he is still in the transit area
5960031 he could be returned to his homeland since we do not want him here
5960032 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5960033 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5960034 at this point in time there is no discussion about a late move
5960035 as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
5960036 we are probably at a position where it is not possible to have a world class event elsewhere the shorter time frame the less likely that is of happening
5960037 i think the time for switching to another host country has passed
5960038 its a complicated legal process its something i would not be able to tell you at this point
5960039 if not it will come down to a decision from the players
5960040 our position is that we cant recommend that our players should tour pakistan
5960041 our safety concerns are very much based on the report that was supplied by the icc and the report of the fica world players body commission which the pakistan board has and the report that reg dickason completed for cricket australia
5960042 having that year off definitely helped the body out i was able to fix a few other things up as well
5960043 just being away from the club i didnt have to go to all the meetings and that through the year it just freshened the mind up as well so hopefully at the end of my career it might add one or two years on there
5960044 its obviously a massive milestone something im very proud of but i probably wont appreciate it until i retire and realise just how hard it is
5960045 we need to win the next few games and thats all were going to be focussed on if we dont win this weekend its fair to say we wont be playing finals
5960046 once you get to 200 games it means youve been around for a while
5960047 he and browny havent played together a lot the last three years
5960048 in terms of their goal scoring as a pair theyre very good and daniel individually has certainly had his best year goal kicking in terms of his consistency
5960049 hes got good hands a good leap and when he attacks the ball from the front position hes very hard to stop
5960050 i dont think scott prince is a liability at any stage hes a great footballer who has shown great courage
5960051 princey was prepared to break his arm for us last weekend and that gives you strength and determination to dig deep
5960052 it makes you think youre not going too bad when youve got a guy in your team with a crack in his arm whos prepared to keep turning up for you
5960053 you do your best but these days theres not many places to hide out there
5960054 the cowboys found him a couple of times on the weekend and princey made his tackles
5960055 hell get a lot of confidence out of last weeks game in terms of putting his body in front of people and im sure hes prepared to do it again
5960056 we like to think whether it be princey or anyone else we are there to cover up any mishaps we have and we take that philosophy into the game
5960057 we know what were going to get out of scott and hopefully he knows what he is going to get out of us
5960058 it says a lot about scott he would do that
5960059 its not only what he does on the field its what he brings to our whole dynamics
5960060 if i was the neighbor right next to that id want as much barrier as i could have
5960061 still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so fucking smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what fuck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
5960062 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight
5960063 you know youre never too old to burn your bridges because i believe i have offended everyone i think ive got a couple more ill burn that bridge when i come to it is my favourite phrase ive ever coined
5960064 was hesitant about trying another north beach restaurant but was pleased with this place due to one dish wild boar pasta is to live for and
5960065 after working in the area today i decided to grab a late lunch very early dinner and i felt like korean food
5960066 what the hell are you taking so long made up your mind yet dumb ass dont waste my time
5960067 oh baby it is all about the crab cones and the lychee mojitos lovely helpful staff and what a fabulous seafood menu
5960068 everybody uses msg in pho if they dont theyre lying
5960069 the masses of our people demand of us to do everything in our power to help pull the poor from the morass of wretchedness
5960070 the challenge facing our region during this era is to do extraordinary things so as to build the free trade area and consolidate its gains for the mutual benefit of the regions economies and development
5960071 summit called for the acceleration of interventions to further deepen the regional integration agenda through the development of a programme of cooperation aimed at expanding regional production capacity which entails provision and rehabilitation of regional infrastructure to facilitate efficient movement of goods and people in a more open economy
5960072 my right foot became swollen during the race and its still painful to walk i think its going to take a while to get better the pain is pretty much constant so i dont know if itll get better on its own
5960073 before the race i didnt feel like id be able to reach my goals the only thing i wanted was for it not to end by me dropping out
5960074 i shattered my reputation in beijing so i want to take some time off to think about things
5960075 a malay child is our child a chinese child is our child an indian child is also our child why is there a need for us to differentiate

5960077 if islam is a way of life how can we say that those who want to live by its principles in legal social political and economic spheres of life are not muslims but islamists and believe in islamism not just islam
5960078 i feel like ive been waiting my whole life to play this role
5960079 my mother is always the most vulnerable person in any room and so i definitely have that part of her inside me
5960080 i think diana is a lot like my mother in her theatricality her sparkle and her joie de vivre and also in the fact that she throws cutlery across the stage at one point
5960081 that was just enough to realize kind of what was yet to be discovered
5960082 it should be played realistically almost cinematically but its larger than life when diana breaks down
5960083 im hoping that this d c production will define the tone in a beautiful way so that without a doubt a majority of people in the room will see it and appreciate the beauty of it and never be tempted to see it with a cynical eye
5960084 i sent an e mail to everybody and said you really have to catch the show because its about our heritage its the suburbs its the family its the impossible task of making it look easy and getting it together
5960085 it is as if she is the real daughter i am also a real daughter
5960086 i saw him at christmas and i spent my birthdays with him
5960087 mrs mccain was raised as the only child of jim and marguerite hensley and there was no familiar relationship with any other sibling
5960088 im angry it makes me feel like a nonperson kind of
5960089 it doesnt make any kind of sense at all portalski said yesterday
5960090 he was generous over the years when i was growing up so it doesnt compute that he would do that that he would leave all of us out
5960091 he was my father too i dont know why even now he cannot be a part of my life
5960092 i wanted to respond some way because innocent people are dying
5960093 we get into rehearsal and we were starting to talk caligari and the talk goes to georgia right away
5960094 im not a politician i also have russian friends i wanted to respond some way because innocent people are dying and i thought host and guest is the only way to do it
5960095 me and irakli and konstantine we thought maybe we should consider somehow to support
5960096 we thought we should go there and stand next to our own people and then
5960097 theirs is an operation that everyone will be studying for campaigns to come
5960098 obamas success online is as much about how our society has changed how our media ecology has changed just in the past four years
5960099 in one afternoon my dad is reaching friends who in the past would have taken him a whole year to be in contact with thats not necessarily obama thats the internet
5960100 but you have to give credit where credit is due obamas internet team is doing a hell of a job taking advantage of all these changes theyve basically leapfrogged not just the clinton and mccain campaigns but also the mainstream media when it comes to reaching their supporters
5960101 i like to say that we at the dean campaign were the wright brothers we put this rickety thing together and got it off the ground but the folks in obamas online team are the apollo project the question is are they apollo 8 or apollo 11 if theyre apollo 11 theyre going to launch a guy and land him in the white house

5960107 i think part of what i will be doing will be putting together various constituents of the college
5960108 ive been involved in lots of areas of the college and hopefully ill be able to help us all understand each other better
5960109 rick is so well versed with our students he really understands them and their culture
5960110 he and i have worked together in the past so we know where each other stands on issues like the gentlemans rule
5960111 well be able to hit the ground running working together to help our students achieve the high expectations we have of them
5960112 ive thought about it and what it means for a long time we will encourage reflection on that both individually and as a community
5960113 his commitment to wabash students connection to faculty and staff patience and sense of humor among other fine qualities make him an excellent choice
5960114 im going to be dealing with students on a daily basis now from a different position than as a professor
5960115 but thats really what teaching is as a teacher im bringing what i have learned to the classroom and attempting to cross the space to where the students are so i see that as experience that will be helpful when were talking about what the gentlemans rule means to this community
5960116 im really excited about this opportunity to serve the college in a new way
5960117 i hope that by serving in this capacity ill be able to help bring all the constituencies of the college into a better understanding of our students and the many complexities of the gentlemans rule

5960124 we are really proud to have become carbonneutral however this is just a starting point we want our customers to be assured than an ecourier delivery will be the most environmentally responsible delivery they can make
5960125 transport is one of the biggest producers of co2 and we welcome this move by ecourier the real positive is the action the company is taking to reduce emissions and the educational role they have with their customers more companies should follow this lead
5960126 i look at the aspects of our ticket where were strongest and where were most in need of help and joe brings more to the ticket than any of the other people whose names are mentioned as finalists

5960130 oh i know you you come in all the time dont worry in you go
5960131 with or without religion youd have good people doing good things and evil people doing bad things but for good people to do bad things it takes religion
5960132 it seems god has punished him for not having enough faith
5960133 for centuries the church has stood by while science picked away at religion bit by bit debunking miracles training the mind to overcome the heart condemning religion as the opiate of the masses they denounce god as a hallucination a delusional crutch for those too weak to accept that life is meaningless
5960134 faith is universal our specific methods for understanding it are arbitrary some of us pray to jesus some of us go to mecca and some of us study subatomic particles in the end we are all just searching for truth that which is greater than ourselves

5960153 playing in the fifa world cup is an ambition shared by the entire nation and were looking forward to a full house and vocal support from queenslanders to help the players on the journey to south africa
5960154 i have no doubt the qantas socceroos will receive a rousing reception from queenslanders when they take to the field
5960155 the queensland government has contributed millions to sport and to the development of world class football venues that attract high profile football matches such as this 2010 fifa world cup qualifier
5960156 we will have to work hard to achieve qualification but playing in the fifa world cup is something every player wants to do and they know what they need to do to get there

5960168 this means that appropriate child safety barriers will need to be in place before settlement
5960169 the state government is acting to ensure all homes with pools have up to date child safety barriers installed before the can be sold
5960170 the safest option is to have the pool fenced so that it is isolated from the house and the rest of the yard with a self closing self latching gate
5960171 pool owners should also learn resuscitation skills and have a resuscitation chart attached to the pool fence

5960177 het spijt me dat ik het geld meegenomen heb ik voel me echt beschaamd
5960178 ik gooide het weg met de gedachte dat alleen anderen winnen
5960179 maar uiteindelijk viste ik de verpakking weer uit de vuilnisbak en waagde mijn kans ik ontdekte dat ik een winnend nummer had
5960180 oh jesus fucking christ jesus mother fuck save me lord save me god i need your help right now

5960354 all the world is supposed to be supporting us but where is that power
5960355 weve been reminded of the streak all the time you just cant think about it
5960356 you have to go out and give your team the best chance to win
5960357 thats one of the best games pitched against us all year
5960358 he had to dive for it so base hit i didnt think about it it got through
5960359 i think it probably should have went for an error
5960360 it wasnt that hard of a play and it hit off my glove its a play i definitely should have made im kind of surprised they gave that a hit there was a complete game pool and he won it so im happy for him
5960361 when you have more errors than hits you know its not a good night
5960362 it was a lot of fun knowing all my pitches were going for strikes
5960363 its the best feeling when youre rolling along like that i was throwing my breaking ball for strikes late in the game until someone showed they could hit it i was going to keep throwing it
5960364 but giving up a double to the pitcher on a bad pitch was the frustrating thing it was just that one pitch
5960365 i told the legislative leaders that its extremely important not to leave before we have a budget done
5960366 if there is no budget i will not be in denver for seven days thats for sure
5960367 hes not going to micromanage how they get this done
5960368 consistently were listening to the democratic leadership and frankly the governor talk about raising taxes and im just tired of hearing it were not going to do it
5960369 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want this process to move faster
5960370 the alliance has to take a united firm position but without being aggressive
5960371 clearly shows that nato intends to support the territorial integrity independence and sovereignty of georgia and to support its democratically elected government
5960372 they were wearing khaki their weapons were american the humvees they used looked american
5960373 they didnt have any ranks on their shoulders they didnt talk
5960374 that came to conduct the operation had air cover this air cover was american helicopters they shot at the police in protection of their unit
5960375 these violations represent a violation of the law they claim they have come to implement
5960376 is incapacitated and appears to present no public safety risk
5960377 how are we supposed to contest this or oppose it if were not familiar with what is going on
5960378 the tribes are as sympathetic as anyone else to the plight of the charities
5960379 they just want to be sure that whatever the charities do is operating within a regulated environment
5960380 we tried to craft this so they can make more money for more services to more people
5960381 if i lost the electronic games i would not be able to keep that bingo hall operational
5960382 i cant survive on paper and dauber games anymore at best i would break even with no money for the saddle pals program
5960383 it would take years and years for us to net out of remote caller bingo what i net out of the machines today
5960384 we have to do something or we are going to die
5960385 but ive probably seen about 40 to 50 roaming the hallways
5960386 we already have more than half of doctors not taking medi cal patients because of low reimbursement rates so the additional rate cut was going to further reduce access to care for millions of children parents seniors and people with disabilities
5960387 weve always said these are difficult but necessary cuts in order for the state to close its 15 billion budget deficit
5960388 i think all the way along many of us have thought this was not a good idea because reimbursement rates already are very low and a cut could be the straw that breaks the camels back in physicians and nursing homes deciding not to cover medi cal patients
5960389 right now we have such a big budget hole that we are at loggerheads in resolving that its always difficult when somebody makes the hole bigger
5960390 it looks like the judge recognized that these people have no access and certainly not equal access to services at least not the way the federal program was envisioned

5960402 let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water
5960403 let the land produce vegetation seed bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it according to their various kinds
5960404 let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth

5960411 the university has reached a settlement with dr mcmaster and we cannot comment on any outstanding grievance issues concerning him
5960412 i made it very clear it is not my job to make economic decisions
5960413 however it is important we act on the pressures now facing not only people on low incomes but also the hard pressed middle classes on fixed incomes with large mortgage commitments who are neither rich nor poor and pensioners whose small occupational pensions or savings mean they miss out on extra benefits
5960414 contrary to the spin i did not propose a super tax on the rich what i said was if the only way to help hard pressed middle class families is to ask the highest earners to pay more then serious consideration should be given to that
5960415 i totally deplore the politics of envy but i strongly believe labour must always be the party of fairness
5960416 there are two really good reasons why we wont be moving
5960417 were not saying the riders wont use the new velodrome they would be mad not to before the olympics indeed before beijing the squad went down to train at the track in newport but manchester will remain our main headquarters for the olympic and paralympic squads
5960418 this sport is not just for gold medalists like chris hoy and victoria pendleton its for the local community too we have a popular programme for school groups and a community club run by volunteers jason queally who won a gold in 2000 started in one of our taster sessions
5960419 the value of the velodrome is its a real melting pot pensioners schoolchildren and the elite cyclists all use the same facilities the kids will be getting ready when the olympians pass through sometimes they might be cycling alongside them
5960420 people have been phoning to book sessions and saying their child wants to ride in the 2012 olympics
5960421 there have been a number of fires on the site all of which were started deliberately it is by sheer luck no one has been injured although part of the site has suffered damage as a result of one of the fires
5960422 we are treating this as arson with intent to endanger life a very serious offence which carries a lengthy prison sentence
5960423 if anyone has any information about the person or people responsible please dont hesitate to get in touch
5960424 we received a call at 9 53 regarding a fire involving cardboard and wood in an isolated room it was reported by a site foreman who had stamped it out by the time we arrived
5960425 we sent one fire engine followed soon after by a fire investigation team while the team were there they were informed by another builder of another small fire which he had put out with an extinguisher and of two other small fires dealt with by workers all the incidents are being treated as suspicious
5960426 it is a busy site with people there from 7am it would be very easy for someone to run around with a lighter to different parts of the site and go unnoticed
5960427 everyone is fed up of the constant interruptions and we are nervous we cant understand why whoever it is hasnt been caught yet
5960428 i am inquisitive by nature which has helped me in my job but in this case it seems to have been my downfall
5960429 it was a stupid thing to do but it was just a knee jerk reaction
5960430 now criminal proceedings have finished our professional standards branch will carry out an internal investigation

5960434 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
5960435 by disproving the long held assumption that face processing is universally achieved we have highlighted that the external environment including the society in which we develop is very influential in basic human mechanisms and caution should be taken when generalising findings to the entire human population
5960436 we have no control of what the university do it was scientists at manchester who first successfully split the atom and we had no control of them back then either it will be a sad day if the city becomes notorious for being the centre of the countrys nuclear industry
5960437 it doesnt alter our view that nuclear energy is against the best interests of our citizens and the world in general
5960438 we believe our team offers the right blend of capabilities covering nuclear research skills development laboratory operations government contract management
5960439 we have not yet formally committed to bidding for the contract as we await the launch of the competitive process and further information from government
5960440 the universitys involvement in access to the lab in future is not exclusive and will allow all british academics to engage as necessary
5960441 she opened the door and i could smell turps i sat up and asked had she knocked the turps over she did not say anything
5960442 i heard the lighter go as if she was lighting a cigarette she was stood in the living room
5960443 there were a lot of flames i was trying to use cushions and get her garment off her it was obvious that her garment was on fire
5960444 she started to get niggly and i cannot say about what i had a happy life and she loved her son
5960445 it is unlikely that adults would survive burns as extensive as this
5960446 they had argued but it was no different to general domestic arguments it was an attention seeking or temper reaction
5960447 i am sure that she did the act that caused her death but i am not sure that she intended to take her own life
5960448 the fire service has been magnificent with its support for the family
5960449 at the scene of the fire he was still conscious though in shock and pain at wythenshawe hospital he was still conscious but when he went into the intensive care unit the sedation started because of the pain and so doctors could manage him better
5960450 when he opened his eyes his first words to his family were hiya pete hiya mam to his mother and her partner
5960451 when he spoke to his nieces my daughters hayley and louise it was quite emotional nurses told me hes very lucky to be here hes still very poorly but his burns are healing
5960452 god willing he will make a full recovery but we know that could be a long way off he is having physiotherapy every day for 15 minutes to move his arms and legs he will have to learn to walk again
5960453 recovery will take time but given his courage and tenacity we are sure he will overcome the difficulties
5960454 andrew was let go after the owner found him passed out under the bushes in front of the restaurant one sunday morning
5960455 it is perfectly normal and linguistically fascinating but people sometimes find it embarrassing
5960456 they think it is a sign of incompetence when it is really a sign of resiliency and creativity

5960461 het is eveneens een re nie van acht kunstenaars die ieder in het afgelopen decennium in samenwerking met architect paul van de poel amp partners hun werk in diverse gebouwen integreerden het is dan ook een kleine hommage aan een manier van werken waarbij een team van bouwheer architekt aannemers technici en kunstenaars n ge ntegreerd en waardevol geheel te cre eren ver voorbij de 1 regeling kon zo vanuit de complementaire perspectieven van architectuur en kunst in een nieuw soort bouwproces gewerkt worden dat helpt om vraagtekens te zetten bij gevestigde waarden en ge mobiliseerde gebouwen en bij de mythische eenzame rol van architect of kunstenaar in het hart van deze manifestatie zitten enkele momenten waarop deskundigen uit de wereld van architectuur en kunst van gedachten zullen wisselen over de rol van architectuur kunst en schoonheid in de sfeer van wonen werken en samenleven samenspel is een kwetsbaar platform voor vormelijke en inhoudelijke verrijking

5960474 we are disturbed by these reports that a group of thugs in a government vehicle could systematically ransack the offices of critical newspapers
5960475 senegals reputation as a beacon of press freedom in west africa has dimmed in recent years the authorities must begin to reverse this decline by showing that those responsible for these attacks will be held to account
5960476 there is no difference between verbal written and physical violence press freedom does not at all give a journalist the right to continually attack honest citizens with impunity
5960477 violence is no ones perquisite and when one saws the wind one should expect to reap the whirlwind

5960480 we have henrik larsson as captain tomorrow and i hope we can do quite well
5960481 henrik larsson is still a great player he is probably the best player in the swedish league he is a very strong player
5960482 we all expect a very good match an open game but of course france are a world class nation we are strong at home i think it will be a very tight game
5960483 as he henry is here and pat patrick viera injured isnt thierry has all the qualities and skills to be captain but in the future that remains to be seen
5960484 this made it impossible to find any dna to compare with a suspected perpetrator
5960485 that kind of crime scene does not lend itself to finding small invisible traces such as a speck of saliva unless there is a clear glob of spit it is difficult to find dna
5960486 is it correct that you found a strand of hair from an unknown man
5960487 if its really hard and we have to sit there for hours thinking how to integrate this its probably not the right play

5960502 it is important not to let anyone tell you that they can guarantee you the top position on google yahoo or msns results
5960503 while they can have an effect no search engine optimization company can control these results the only way a dental website optimization company can guarantee continuing page one results is to buy a paid ad beware this can be a very expensive proposition
5960504 search engine results can be broken into two segments organic and paid
5960505 generally organic results pull a better response from potential dental patients than paid ads in some cases by as much as much as 8 to 1

5960517 what this is if you will is a campaign that were running
5960518 my overall impression is that sun has seized upon a legitimate market opportunity here stemming from the usual fud surrounding the rationalization and integration of two such daunting product portfolios oracle and bea and more uniquely the purported price increase oracle announced for weblogic in july
5960519 sun is hoping to make some inroads with existing and potential weblogic customers that may find oracles road map and pricing structure too daunting
5960520 were second in the brc points going into the event and having won the brc section of the event last year well be aiming for a repeat performance
5960521 it is always a privilege to drive for a manufacturer so i was delighted to be asked
5960522 i realise that i have a job to do for the team and i will give it my best shot especially as the ulster rally is one of my favourite events
5960523 however having not driven competitively since the end of last year and with a new co driver next to me its going to be no easy task but ive never been one to shy away from a challenge
5960524 elfyn will once again be bidding for success in the fiesta sporting trophy ireland and its going to be an interesting battle between him and alastair fisher who currently shares the lead of the championship
5960525 when you drink this one its like pow to your taste buds
5960526 much of it is very poor quality thin green insipid lacking elegance and any sort of depth
5960527 the biggest challenge is getting people who dont have the first clue about western food to make wine to go with western food
5960528 its so remote theyve never tasted western food and they hadnt tasted western wine until last year
5960529 ive been at banquets with some vineyard workers who are muslim and seen them drinking they dont have hang ups about alcohol
5960530 its not an olympic gimmick for us its a very serious brand we plan to grow quite strongly
5960531 your no 1 responsibility is to make money and theres a lot of ordering and purchasing and trying to keep costs under control
5960532 youre constantly overseeing things and make sure that the menus change with the seasons i like to change the menu every four weeks that gives you the ability to work with the freshest and the best of the season
5960533 im always seeking out local products im seeing whats in season with local purveyors and its research tracking down these products i go out and see what theyre doing at the farms its like taste development
5960534 i build the ideas and the concepts how itll all work how the cooking stations should be balanced and ultimately how the food will be plated we go through how everything should be done and at that point its the responsibility to do that on a daily basis teaching is the biggest aspect of the job
5960535 there are executive chefs who are like nasty mean screamers i dont feel like you should have to do that and if you do you shouldnt have hired that staff in the first place
5960536 theres not as much cooking involved as you might think
5960537 the no 1 responsibility is to make money and the other part is to teach the concepts with the food and make sure things come out exactly the same every time
5960538 i just found some stone fruit from this incredible producer in placerville
5960539 and dont ask people to do something that you wouldnt do
5960540 when he was young he would always try different foods and his palate was fairly well developed as an executive chef his minds going in a million different directions but hes learning how to manage it
5960541 theres a favorite saying i heard that every chef would like to be a cook if it wasnt for the money
5960542 im waking up at 3 a m with some grandiose idea and get on my computer
5960543 gabriel cant just add six new saut items to the menu without knowing how it will affect the station
5960544 it would be fun to go downtown and play with the big boys
5960545 its blazing fast work but you get used to it
5960546 its more of that sense of accomplishment when you get through a big push i live for that kind of stuff
5960547 i remember going to the old state fair on stockton boulevard with my dad when i was a little girl
5960548 we walked into this big room where all the jams and jellies were displayed those were the days when they hung the actual ribbon awards on the jars
5960549 ive got a big box of ribbons under my bed
5960550 but even after winning so many its still a thrill
5960551 my daughter was taking a wood working class and her teacher encouraged her to enter the fair i make pretty good pies so i decided to enter my blackberry pie in the fair too
5960552 last year i just dropped the pie off at 7 30 in the morning i didnt stick around for the judging because i had to get back in east bay for work and i never really expected to win anything
5960553 this year im taking the day off if i win another ribbon i want to be there
5960554 my grandparents were in a world war ii internment camp after that they were sharecroppers in loomis everything was preserved and saved so i just developed an interest in canning from that background
5960555 thats absolutely devastating when a judge finds a cherry pit an eggshell or horrors a hair thats a competitors worst nightmare
5960556 we are told to sit there and not show any emotion as our entries are being judged
5960557 so i was watching as the judge popped the lid off my blackberry jam and there on top was a quarter size piece of mold
5960558 in 30 years ive never seen an entry as bad as mine and i still dont know what went wrong
5960559 maybe it was a berry seed on the edge of the jar that prevented a perfect seal i still worry about it
5960560 i try not to work later than about 1 a m or i just get too tired but there are a lot of things i want to make at the last minute so that they look as pretty as possible
5960561 i think making it fresh is the secret to winning so many ribbons
5960562 im hoping they will be perfect the day i need to bake my pie
5960563 the auto tune vocal studio offers the most powerful collection of vocal processing tools in existence

5960569 prices are going to drop because it cant keep going up i cant buy my medicines
5960570 i think that people are scared everythings going up costs are going up people are watching their pennies
5960571 you see it in the number of patients scheduled in advance its the difference between being scheduled one month instead of three months in advance
5960572 a lot of people are shopping the internet more now and just being wary of prices
5960573 its the economy the number of patients who had scheduled for a while ago say they cant afford it now and want to defer for the future
5960574 now financing companies are becoming more difficult in who they approve
5960575 were just trying to be a little bit more proactive by utilizing past patients as referral sources and offering specials to our patients who refer friends
5960576 if you look across the board youre seeing a lot more advertising in this field
5960577 the spendable income on luxury items seems to continue for several months after there are signs the economy is bad and the increase back to normal levels doesnt take place until several months after the economy has corrected itself
5960578 this seems to be a matter of money set aside for such a luxury

5960583 for them its not a marketing choice its a winemaking choice they feel they get better wine sourcing from around the state

5960597 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
5960598 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
5960599 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
5960600 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up

5960635 there is strong evidence to suggest that mortgage default and repossessions in scotland are an increasing problem for many people
5960636 even just seeing a 42 increase in traffic to our website is an indicator people are already seeking help
5960637 with repossessions set to rise this year we worry that even though we provide advice online on the phone and in person that we havent got the resources to help everyone
5960638 in fact many people looked at me as if i was crazy when i told them they think being homeless means being on the streets
5960639 but we have been in our new tenancy for almost a year and our children are making new friends we are feeling more settled and secure
5960640 there is no evidence of a need for a new advice service

5960650 die arbeit die wir hier gemeinsam leisten ist enorm relevant f r co2 reduktion klimaschutz denn die aufgabe die wir heute mit antriebssystemen haben ist bei gleicher fahrleistung in autos und nutzfahrzeugen drastisch co2 zu reduzieren das k nnen wir auch
5960651 gerade wir als avl haben viel geforscht und entwickelt und haben regelm ig emissionslevels auf der schadstoffseite und jetzt auch auf der co2 seite deutlich reduziert und setzen diese ergebnisse auch um
5960652 there have been suggestions from companies such as indian oil and it can surely be looked into by the government to mitigate the supply demand mismatch

5960657 the death of the mainline is the central historical fact of our time the event that distinguishes the past several decades from every other period in american history almost every one of our current political and cultural oddities our contradictions and obscurities derives from this fact the mainline has lost the capacity to set or even significantly influence the national vocabulary or the national self understanding
5960658 they are saying that the roman catholic church is now more hospitable to confessional lutheran teaching than the church in which they were baptized and confirmed
5960659 the single best predictor of church participation turned out to be belief orthodox christian belief and especially the teaching that a person can be saved only through jesus christ amazingly enough fully 68 of those who are still active presbyterians dont believe it
5960660 the churches desperate hunger to mean more in politics and economics had the perverse effect of making them less effective opponents of the political and economic pressures on the nation they mattered more when they wanted to matter less

5960663 stuck out a little bit more with the things she did with this student
5960664 i love what i do it doesnt seem like a job
5960665 wir brauchen nicht zu den olympischen spielen zu fahren um zu wissen wer die goldmedaille gewinnt
5960666 dies ist ein kleiner schritt f r einen menschen ein gro er schritt f r die menschheit
5960667 there is virtually no prospect of this animal being real
5960668 we wouldnt know what we were doing if we did
5960669 a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot
5960670 later that day tom biscardi informed us that both matthew whitton and ricky dyer admitted it was a costume
5960671 at this time action is being instigated against the perpetrators
5960672 is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception
5960673 requested an undisclosed sum of money as an advance expected from the marketing and promotion
5960674 sorry that my name and stanfords name have been brought into this
5960675 but i cant imagine why anyone would devote their lives to proving the existence of bigfoot anything has a remote chance of being true but there is virtually no prospect of this animal being real
5960676 absolutely nowadays i dont think crytek could have set up
5960677 it wouldnt exist the situation has changed drastically the competition is more serious companies have consolidated costs have increased the platforms are getting more difficult to enter
5960678 for example to make a next gen pc title entering the market now wed need about eur 10 12 million even for a newcomer to make an fps as good as far cry was back then to get the trust and commitment from a publisher for a newby studio i think its quite impossible
5960679 from the concept perspective dont rely on anything thats about realism or technology focus on something that involves creativity and gameplay
5960680 the second thing on the business perspective i would suggest looking at digital distribution whether its you or a publisher distributing it it doesnt matter but prepare for that market then youve already narrowed down your choice of platforms which is either pc mobile iphone modding potentially xbla and psn
5960681 i think the number one thing we learned was to be agile and iterative we knew that already but that thought was confirmed
5960682 always stay independent agile and iterative but when i say that it doesnt mean necessarily being independent of a publisher but being having the ability to make decisions
5960683 if you want to make iterations it means you need to be able to cycle through changes quickly and again you cant need to ask somebody before you make changes so it doesnt necessarily mean financial or business independence thats one idea to aim for but also within the structure of the company
5960684 its a tossup whether i check gamesindustry biz or make my morning coffee first as both are essential to my early morning routine i find gamesindustry biz a key component of my research with the sites editors and reporters breaking news stories more often than any of its competitors
5960685 there are a lot of financial questions that im not real comfortable with yet
5960686 its a complicated societal issue its not a matter of college universities changing the law
5960687 theres definitely lots of underage drinking going on on campus
5960688 if youre able to carry a rifle and be sitting in combat you should be able to have a beer
5960689 some people are going to drink a lot anyway but for your first timers out there that get really really wasted and get a little out of control and do stupid things they wouldnt normally do i think it would reduce a lot of that
5960690 when its strictly 21 you get more and more house parties and they have problems you could have date rapes the binge drinking
5960691 when youre in a controlled environment like this establishment or any other you dont have those problems
5960692 many of these people just need some assistance and understanding on our part so that they can move back into normal physical and mental capabilities and work safely
5960693 we need everyone to feel confident in everyone elses abilities to focus on their tasks and be safe supporting the military is part of union pacifics culture and heritage and is something that the entire company gets involved with
5960694 its something that employees show a lot of pride in

5960696 obviously it was nice having that lead going into the ninth inning
5960697 she did a good job she made a good adjustment and put the ball in play for us
5960698 its a shame it happened in the most important race of my life its like a race car going into a turn sometimes you crash and burn i crashed and burned its the hurdles you have to get over all 10 or youre not meant to be olympic champion i was not meant to be olympic champion
5960699 i wouldnt say jogging im just trying to get through to the next round i just wanted to make sure i was in good position i was looking at crawford and then i decided to look at the board to see where everybody else was
5960700 i was definitely in control of the race and i got to the 320 mark and my right hamstring grabbed on me i just couldnt move it anymore i tried to hold them off and i just couldnt
5960701 im so disappointed i never had anything like that happen i was totally out of control on the straightaway i was all over the lane and christine ohuruogu was just really strong coming home
5960702 i thought i was gonna run 48 seconds i felt so good i was already getting a bit elated coming off the turn because i know how my races usually go and i just had a really tough break on that one my hamstring just let me down and i feel like ive just worked so hard in vain
5960703 i dont want to tell you right now what im thinking because its not positive i just feel so betrayed by my body once again and its such a tough break for me
5960704 you know its just so discouraging its almost like i dont know i dont want to say its just really hard
5960705 i have a really strong faith and i know that everything happens for a reason i just dont know what this one is for i dont know what lesson i have to learn i feel like ive been faithful and ive worked hard last season i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy and to come up short again its just overwhelming
5960706 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft

5960742 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5960743 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5960744 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5960745 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
5960746 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
5960747 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
5960748 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
5960749 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5960750 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5960751 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened

5960762 im not sure this is the most cost effective use of these funds
5960763 sometimes an experiment like this is just that an experiment and you dont find out until later that it doesnt really work out too well
5960764 there was a sense that they needed to put some money toward the problem and do that fairly quickly before the election
5960765 thats probably why there wasnt as much of a consultative process as there might have been had they had more time to put something together and really vet it out

5960775 they must acknowledge a dangerous and painful truth key leaders of pakistans military and its inter services intelligence agency have long collaborated with armed islamic extremists operating in afghanistan the indian province of kashmir and pakistans own tribally administered regions along the afghan border in their eyes these extremists serve pakistans strategic interests in reality as the times has extensively reported these militants kill american and nato soldiers indian diplomats and pakistani civilians
5960776 it will take personal courage and broad political support to clean up these forces and finally bring them under civilian control pakistans leaders will better their odds if they stop pretending that the fight against terrorism is somehow americas problem and not pakistans they will also have to stop pretending that ad hoc cease fires and bribes to insurgent leaders can roll back the taliban threat

5960792 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat

5960801 estamos empezando a ver a compa as tradicionales intentando poner en marcha ideas boutique o de dise o

5960803 no justification for that call thats a crucial moment in that game youre going to blow calls on bang bang plays that happens fabrication i have no time for and then to be validated by the crew chief i dont like at all thats what pissed me off
5960804 im not backing off on this one because im going to get fined on that so screw em but im telling you thats the kind of call that can cost you a pennant right there
5960805 its much easier to watch on the field than on tv
5960806 tv really creates way too much drama about an event
5960807 ive always felt that so youre watching this little box on the wall i cant stand it when it comes to significant moments i hate to like bag on tv people i like the office curb your enthusiasm on hbo but when it comes to live events it drives me nuts
5960808 hopefully they dont start to believe until theyre sitting there watching tv and were playing in the playoffs
5960809 we cracked open the door with an error a wild throw by catcher and the walks and aybar got the big hit for them
5960810 especially the way things have gone the last 10 years but we knew we had a good team theres always been talent here playing on other teams blue jays red sox we knew they were talented but they either gave it up late or something happened where they lost the game
5960811 but the starting pitching i saw in spring training i said oh my god were really good
5960812 but until youre actually down and see hey we werent just talking we have each others backs that moment kind of sealed the deal we know it now
5960813 im not sure the guys understand the historical importance of this
5960814 nobodys done this this is an epic turnaround for the ballclub and the franchise im excited to be a part of it
5960815 but he beat the odds nobody today wondered what youre going to get from him nobody he came in with his head high he went out there and showed what hes capable of doing every night thats what we need
5960816 very lovingly respectfully but firmly well let him know its no reflection on his character hes a great kid a great player youll see him go off absolutely these last few weeks
5960817 he has to understand that i was there for him
5960818 believe me as a group were working together on this one and were going to make it right

5960820 sometimes you win sometimes you lose thats the way it is in sports
5960821 unfortunately the olympic gold medal in football will have to wait again
5960822 its another generation that couldnt win the title now all we can do is try to win the bronze
5960823 we have to have the strength to stay motivated in a moment like this
5960824 its not easy but we have to keep working hard just as we had been doing before
5960825 we wouldnt have problems if we won all the time but thats not always possible
5960826 the demands will increase but we will continue our work as planned
5960827 but we have to finish the competition with our heads up and that means with the bronze
5960828 its been causing pain and inflammation for some time and i just need to have it cleared up so i can get back on the floor sooner rather than later
5960829 him being here as a runaway is not a crime
5960830 more a cry for help than an act of criminal behavior
5960831 its better that his family come and take him home than for him to languish for a couple of days over something that was very minor
5960832 weve got to tighten up the amateur program so that in four years we do a whole lot better
5960833 the problem is that these days its all about money when its all about money this happens the guys are just thinking about money theres a kind of manipulation where the kids are being told go and turn pro gold medals arent important
5960834 the managers dont want the guys winning golds because then they have to pay them more
5960835 back in the day amateur boxing was on tv every weekend in the states
5960836 when you have a good amateur program it helps develop well rounded boxers look at the pro game now why do the championships change hands so quickly its because these guys dont know how to fight different styles
5960837 when youre a pro you avoid the fighters whose style doesnt suit your style it makes them weak amateur boxing is harder than pro you have to fight everybody in your draw
5960838 genom att kombinera ericssons och st s kompletterande styrkor och produkterbjudanden inom plattformar och halvledare kommer samriskbolaget att vara v lpositionerat f r att bli en v rldsledare
5960839 right now everything is finding a hole and im paying for a lot of mistakes
5960840 with this team being where were at fighting the way we are thats not going to do it
5960841 i didnt have location its very difficult for me if i cant throw the ball where i want to
5960842 i think its really a little odd were sitting here playing our best baseball of the year just landed blake ramirez and maddux and youre asking me about our gm
5960843 i think its very very strange the team is playing great right now theres a lot of enthusiasm everybodys having fun players fans everybody
5960844 i feel were in a good place right now youve got to give credit where credit is due ned and his people have worked very hard to get us where we are
5960845 weve been able to get maddux weve been able to get manny ramirez weve been able to get casey blake we were able to get those three players
5960846 siamo una delle poche squadre che non ha testato le gare al mattino e questa cosa noi italiani labbiamo pagata tutti non solo io stavo bene gli ultimi tre mesi sono stati buoni ma mi sono portato dietro i problemi accumulati nel corso dellanno
5960847 everyone who talked down to them is going to eat their words
5960848 i moved to colorado in 1994 and my first day of school in denver it snowed a foot in september
5960849 that time of year the typical day will see temperatures climb into the 80s and a typical night will drop off into the 50s
5960850 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
5960851 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
5960852 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness
5960853 this woman has sold her soul to the devil for those
5960854 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage
5960855 teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
5960856 higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
5960857 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
5960858 most prior research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk linked to ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and especially young women
5960859 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
5960860 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
5960861 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties
5960862 the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence
5960863 the break is over and its time for the last part of the season to start
5960864 the weather wasnt great during my short holidays but i chilled out a lot with my family played some golf watched the olympics on tv and rode my new bike i love all sorts of sport and the olympics are an incredible event its exciting to watch athletes giving it all and fighting for the gold medals i have great respect for athletes like michael phelps and usain bolt who are the best of the best obviously i like it when the finns are doing well too
5960865 its time to concentrate again on my work now formula 1 is a sport which never stops the team has worked hard to be ready for the race at
5960866 again this season shows that you should never give up
5960867 that would be an issue his administration would have to face early because hes pledging to be a uniter not a divider without saying those exact words we campaigned on in 2000 hes pledging to change the way washington works and if congress were to pursue that it would be very divisive

5960876 for decades annie lennox has put the health of women in africa at the heart of her work whilst our festival will naturally miss her it is only right she is able to concentrate on her own health for a time we wish annie well
5960877 i am hugely disappointed not to be able to attend the festival of politics this year as it was something i was looking forward to immensely once i am back on my feet it will be my imperative to come back up to edinburgh at the earliest opportunity
5960878 i am going to routinely visit all these schools just in case there is a headteacher who has not installed the equipment i expect heads to move fast to the implementation of the safety guidelines given and immediately put in place the necessary institutional framework
5960879 anger that leads to death is an indication of a dangerous society yet we have an obligation to shape our society for a better tomorrow part of the process is by ensuring that we complete the set curriculum to make the students comfortable

5960890 well just have to pretend the crowd is cheering for us
5960891 this is probably the first beach volleyball match ive been nervous in before the match actually started
5960892 probably because if we lost i would have been devastated
5960893 for the love of money is the root of all evi
5960894 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5960895 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5960896 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5960897 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
5960898 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
5960899 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
5960900 but he knowing their thoughts said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and a house divided against a house falleth
5960901 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5960902 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5960903 coupling the two you have slow growth with higher inflation
5960904 well see how he plays next year and well revisit it
5960905 this does not change our position on drafting him or his future with us
5960906 our staff was excited and surprised to get him in the second round hopefully they were right
5960907 piri is an outstanding rugby player and to have him play in new zealand is fantastic for us

5960910 we have to form a circle to protect the man but the battle is being won the security has been well organised
5960911 weve got to tighten up the amateur program so that in four years we do a whole lot better

5960918 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5960919 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5960920 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5960921 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
5960922 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
5960923 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
5960924 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
5960925 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5960926 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5960927 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened
5960928 when i read the initial claims about david they just didnt ring true that a simple country bloke who had a decent family should become a supporter of terrorism
5960929 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide

5960934 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5960935 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable
5960936 but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual the company is cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and believes that accountability is important
5960937 does not apply to civilians working for federal departments or agencies other than dod the department of defense
5960938 if the contractors were not there those state department folks would be guarded by the military prosecutors could argue to the judge that those facts fit within the definition of furthering the defense department mission in iraq

5960969 this submission from the dpp australias primary prosecutorial agency shows that the afp ignored the ground rules for obtaining early high level legal advice lawyer rod hodgson said
5960970 they apparently orchestrated a campaign to keep the dpp in the dark and feed snippets of misleading information for as long as possible
5960971 when the afp were running out of time they put enormous pressure on the dpp to give support for the laying of charges and even then on incomplete and misleading material mr hodgson said
5960972 he claimed to have tinnitus in his ears and declined to board the flight to london

5961029 what does a motorcycle guy know about super duper duper cars
5961030 we will arrange for a charter to remove the individual on a commercial flight or a charter
5961031 in the case of mr jaballah it will be a charter that will have to be done with a private company for the charter we have used a company called skyservice in the past i have contacted them and they say between 48 hours and a week they could organize the flight
5961032 absolutely the nature of some of the work that we do
5961033 we trust that you will cancel or relocate the public vigil currently intended to be held at our offices at 31 fasken drive
5961034 private not for profit corporation responsible for airports in the greater toronto area including operation construction and maintenance
5961035 i dont actually like you but i certainly wouldnt mind having your cock in me
5961036 records have been tumbling in other sports too but none at this rate whats going on have the swimmers found some new technique to propel them more efficiently through the water are they training more intensively or is it down to sheer competitiveness the answer is more prosaic the beijing pool is 3 metres deep a metre deeper than standard competitive pools the extra depth helps dissipate the turbulence caused by the swimmers movement causing less resistance in other words they are being helped by the architecture
5961037 the key to working on good national media marketing design pieces is patience and rote talent
5961038 like many of our employees i started with classical art training and drawing and slowly moved into the post modern area this succession greatly improved my national media marketing art and drawing skills
5961039 the use of computers in our firm has accounted for a five fold increase in productivity quality and sales volume computers allow our national media marketing design specialists a much a higher degree of efficieny and output furthermore since we can make more with less our overhead decreases dramatically and profits will skyrocket
5961040 the fact that most of todays up and coming designers have never used charcoal and a pad of paper doesnt bother me in the least
5961041 because as interest and corporate demand for national media marketing art grows so will the talent base were going to see some great work from some of the top up and coming names in the business
5961042 we look at the work of others not because we want to copy it
5961043 but because we want to take away the best aspects of each national media marketing design and apply them to our own work
5961044 i know there is no such thing as a quick buck but in 5 years when this national media marketing industry blossoms were going to see a lot of new rich people
5961045 ive been a student of national media marketing design for almost 20 years now
5961046 and i cant say ive ever been more excited than now our new director elinore gormally promises to bring things to a much higher level and increase our output i realize this will mean more national media marketing design hours but this also means more money for all of us
5961047 this means a lot to me personally weve worked so hard in this industry for years and finally it is starting to pay off big
5961048 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
5961049 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options
5961050 confidence intelligence and goodness theres nothing sexier than that combination
5961051 i can safely say i dont know if its meant to happen it will i love and adore being a mother
5961052 it swelled up on the flight here its not a big deal

5961059 from our standpoint we shouldnt have to file this lawsuit
5961060 the people who are responsible for this is the office of the attorney general not the pascua yaqui tribe
5961061 im surprised that theyre allowed to go into the courthouse
5961062 speaking with our director of poker and the poker supervisors a lot of the regular poker players disappeared at around the time this card room opened
5961063 part of the thing thats been kind of perplexing about all of this is that the attorney generals office has allowed this to go on for so long without doing anything
5961064 does not meet the limited statutory definitions of amusement regulated and social gambling
5961065 were a 300 year old profession that people have been making a living off of since the mississippi riverboat days
5961066 i dont see how theyre going to get around the fact theyre reaching into our prize pool if they want to go to court and defend stealing im all for it this one i think we can win outright because its clearly wrong to steal from prize pools
5961067 if it is determined that gambling is allowed in the state that should be considered illegal then the tribes not just this tribe could take the stance that theyre not just limited to whats in the gaming compact
5961068 it could be like las vegas with slot machines in the circle ks
5961069 if there is a determination that this is illegal and its being allowed the tribes could suspend making those payments
5961070 thats a huge amount of money it just seems to me that the state would be interested in taking steps to make sure this doesnt happen
5961071 i wish i had wings like a dove so i could fly far away and be at peace i would go and live in some distant desert i would quickly find shelter from howling winds and raging storms
5961072 if you are tired from carrying heavy burdens come to me and i will give you rest i am gentle and humble and you will find rest
5961073 you have rescued me i will celebrate and shout singing praises to you with all my heart
5961074 those last winter storms while not numerically important for our annual rainfall total are critical for the distance we have to go
5961075 at least in part the increasing number of really catastrophic fires in the southwest
5961076 those last winter storms while not numerically important for our annual rainfall total are critical for the distance we have to go
5961077 it just stands to reason that if youre moving storms youre moving precipitation
5961078 i looked at the period from 1978 to 1998 looking at march and april in the southwest the overall decreases are not huge there is not that much rain to start with its on the order of one or two storms a year
5961079 indeed weve seen in fire occurrence records across the west that its correlated with earlier and earlier arrival of spring and snowmelt occurring earlier
5961080 i dont have a dispute with the ida i have no idea what this is about
5961081 i think they the ida are struggling to find a role
5961082 as stewards of public funds we need to know where the money is going
5961083 theres nothing there that wasnt used for a capital expense
5961084 a silly process to account for every nickel and dime
5961085 i dont ask questions if he wanted me to know hed tell me
5961086 its one of the reasons ive been trying to get out of the business of counting money
5961087 i dont worry about the idas concerns because theres nothing to hide its all public information
5961088 in african history the griot is a storyteller he is the village keeper of history
5961089 every time a griot dies it is like a library burning to the ground isaac hayes was a griot of song he captured the excitement imagination and the realities of life love and hope it is sorrowful that we have lost another griot of song but it is a blessing that we were able to capture some of his gold forever
5961090 he just has to swallow hard and do what jfk did
5961091 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board
5961092 hes got to be very concerned by the neck and neck polls and by what happened at saddleback
5961093 its a whole other mind set when you are playing quarterback
5961094 you know where you are supposed to be and timing of the routes but when you are running the routes blocking and things like that its different i think its a little easier to play quarterback
5961095 the incumbents team is simply trying to distract the voters
5961096 when president clinton came to town he came to town for big political events
5961097 this is not something government taxes people to pay for
5961098 i think its important to recognize this was a private event or fundraiser
5961099 if you didnt have local law enforcement for these visits the president wouldnt go anywhere
5961100 its a big deal and we take it very seriously and its very expensive

5961192 aus unserer sicht schafft der bescheid vertragsunsicherheit auf breitem feld
5961193 eine schleichende k ndigung und schlechterstellung der mitbewerber ist rational anzunehmen
5961194 auf basis einer pressemeldung k nnen wir allerdings keine unternehmens und projektplanungen durchf hren
5961195 unsere kritik im verfahren beschr nkt sich nunmehr auf die aus unserer sicht wesentlichen verfahrensfehler
5961196 erst findet man heraus dass die telekom als einziger anbieter ein sterreichweit fl chendeckendes anschlussnetz hat und kein interesse daran bestehe wettbewerbern ein zugangsprodukt anzubieten dann beschlie t man aber einfach den wirtschaftlich gr ten teil dieses marktes aus der analyse zu nehmen und gerade hier die regulierung au er kraft zu setzen
5961197 der zu regulierende markt ist sterreich und nicht ein mal favoriten und ein anderes mal bad goisern unsere sterreichweit agierenden kunden mit zahlreichen niederlassungen w rden uns definitiv nicht f r rational halten wenn wir auf bezirksebene unterschiedliche angebote erstellen m ssten um beispielsweise einige filialen sterreichweit zu vernetzen
5961198 wird der bescheid aufgehoben so haben die alternativen anbieter einen kleinen vorteil man darf sie nicht per vertragsk ndigung vom markt dr ngen aber der ex monopolist hat wohl mindestens ein jahr seinen status quo gesichert und keine neuen auflagen zu f rchten denn eine neue marktanalyse und ein neues verfahren werden ihre zeit brauchen das hei t man kann auf basis eines inzwischen drei jahre alten bescheids den markt auch bereits ganz gut kontrollieren wie die breitbandaktionsangebote der letzten monate gezeigt haben h lt der bescheid dann w re das hingegen wie weihnachten f r die ta und es w rden wohl ein paar sektkorken knallen w hrend die alternativen anbieter sich in die vergangenheit zur ckversetzt f hlen d rften 11 jahre nach schaffung des online tarifs s hen wir uns wieder einer berm chtigen telekom gegen ber und m ssen bei jeder diskussion f rchten dass man uns die vertr ge k ndigt
5961199 diese geschickte positionierung unseres gr ten mitbewerbers verlangt mir jedenfalls respekt ab denn ich anerkenne strategisch meisterleistungen auch wenn sie uns einen nachteil bringen

5961203 just do it how one couple turned off the tv and turned on their sex lives for 101 days no excuses
5961204 at first i sort of thought thats funny ha ha
5961205 but i know annie pretty well and she loves a challenge we talked about it more that night and the next morning and i knew she was serious
5961206 when saturday night sex becomes routine that is when couples need to make sure they are still wooing each other by incorporating spontaneity and novelty
5961207 the next morning i woke up and thought we really need to do this
5961208 our marriage really needs to do this thats how it started
5961209 youve got your porno but now its my turn sex toys
5961210 ive got to research it but im always hearing about how women are using sex toys there are sex toys parties its on oprah its supposed to be healthy im nearly forty and ive never even touched one
5961211 you work you commute you have kids you have to clean up make sure they brush their teeth by the time that part of the day is over you are just tired and ready to zone out
5961212 we werent doing it for the sake of doing it
5961213 the point was to see what would happen we treated it like we were dating again we started looking forward to it
5961214 i really think we communicate so much clearer and with so much more honesty now
5961215 there were so many times before that we hadnt even hugged for like three days in a row we gravitate toward rubbing each others backs more we realize how important it is to put the kids to bed and spend time together
5961216 i would love to see this conversation in every home in america
5961217 gay straight with kids or without this is a conversation that people shrink from and yet its so important once you stop making love to your partner you become roommates whether its five times a month or three times a month just being comfortable with that number is most important
5961218 stop watching tv and bringing the laptop to bed stop multi tasking just listen to one another and hire that housekeeper even if its only once a year or once a month

5961224 unless hes dead on arrival if hes d o a youve got all the time in the world
5961225 to actually be in the middle of it all the gangs and all its just a visual feast

5961228 you cant get close enough to the action for me if youre covering a fire and not getting burned or wet from the hoses youre not close enough
5961229 there are only so many cats stuck in trees you can see before you start wanting a little real excitement
5961230 i remember having all this footage and not doing anything with it

5961234 currently about half the budget of the u s forest service is devoted to fighting wildfires is this a reasonable allocation of public resources
5961235 the forest service budget for fiscal year 2009 is 4 109 billion a drop from 4 126 billion in fiscal 2008 and 4 191 billion in fiscal 2007 is this decline a trend that should continue

5961245 she is winning in counties we lost in 2004 we think that primaries in the middle of the summer favor the republican party we know that early returns tend to come from older more conservative constituencies we think the general election is going to be even stronger when we have younger voters out when we do our voter registrations
5961246 we think obama is going to have tremendous coat tails in that district

5961256 the race will obviously improve this is the first time theyve swum it at the olympics its going to get faster and faster
5961257 i find it hard and im a completely able bodied person
5961258 id even go so far as to award her a separate medal
5961259 i have enormous respect for her it is exceedingly hard just looking at these people inspires you
5961260 its been causing pain and inflammation for some time and i just need to have it cleared up so i can get back on the floor sooner rather than later
5961261 every now and then usain will fall asleep in blocks he does it in the 100m for him to get to approach a time like 19 32 he has to be alert when gun sounds be moving with everyone else and have good reaction time he cant be coming up from behind usain has become more consistent and is making himself into a very good starter in the 100m he had an excellent start but it didnt put him out of the blocks first at his height its very difficult for him to get out of the blocks first but a great start for him would be second out of the blocks
5961262 usain showed at worlds last year that he can be the best turn runner in the world in that 200m race he actually beat on the turn and i consider tyson gay to be the best turn runner in the world tyson was the only runner in the world last year to run the turn in under 10 seconds i dont think usain will need to run a sub 10 second turn but the closer he gets to 10 flat the easier he makes that last 100m if he runs a sub 10 second turn he is almost certainly going to break the record in looking at the numbers if usain runs the turn in 9 9 that means he only has to run the last 100 in 9 4 he just ran 9 6 out of the blocks which means he can probably run close to 9 2 in a flying start
5961263 to be quite honest in the last 10 times usain has run the 200m the number of times ive seen him go from zero to 200 without looking around is once i dont think he can take his eye off the road once and break this record he needs to say im going to put my head down and i cant be looking around in the stands or nothing he cant even take a glance because the research and evidence shows that the minute you take your eyes off the track in front of you you slow down it doesnt have to be a big turnaround either he cant play around its going to require maturity i dont know if he can do it i think hes going to be on pace through 100 and then finds a chance to blow it id hate to see him play around and run 19 39
5961264 there is no substitute for i gotta get away from people in atlanta michael had guys like me to rabbit for him i think usain is going to need there to be runners with him ideally through the 150 i just dont know if there is anyone that will be able to stay with him to 150 have the best chances shawn crawford will definitely be the closest off the turn if usain has runners close to him deep into the race he will have more incentive to keep running hard the fewer runners hes sees close the more likely its going to be that he backs off
5961265 it may not look like it watching the replays but michael johnson ran scared in atlanta he wasnt scared of me but frankie fredericks of namibia had beaten michael a couple times during the year and the only time michael beat frankie was in that race in atlanta to this day i think michael would tell you that i dont think usain is scared of anyone in this field the only runner he might fear is but he knows wallace is not the guy that used to be beat him i know usain is not scared of walter dix hes beaten him before and he knows shawn crawford isnt in the type of shape it would take to beat him i dont think it will matter but it could
5961266 the only person who has ever run a sub 19
5961267 its very deceiving but there has been some wind in the stadium ive looked at results and was surprised to see wind readings in the womens semis they ran into a headwind if usain gets even a modest tailwind behind him he could break the record the wind reading tonight could be the difference between him running 19 40 and 19 30
5961268 usain and michaels running styles are wildly different michael kept everything compact and ran with his arms not far from his body usain i guess you could say is a gangly runner and he has such high knee lift where michael hardly picked his knees up he has the most knee lift of any runner ive ever seen its not necessarily because of his height id like to see if usain can keep his motions more compact
5961269 does usain want to set the world record im not sure hes even thinking about it i know he told bob nuemeir that he wasnt i think the most important thing to him is winning the two gold medals that could determine whether he runs hard all the way through the finish or shuts it down if he has a huge lead
5961270 we are currently working on the structure of the joint venture agreement we expect to finalise the operating structure by september once a mutual agreement is reached the new company is expected to get operational in the next three to six months
5961271 for india our strategy is to increasing frequency of flights on various routes to offer good choice to passengers and a good spread
5961272 india is very important for the carrier and we do not want short term fluctuations to affect its long term strategies in india
5961273 we believe in planning for the long term airline industry witnesses cycles currently it is undergoing a cycle where cost is a bit of an issue but regardless of the current surge in aviation fuel we think in the long term strategy india is a market that can take the growth
5961274 we do not rule it out as potential for the airline industry in india was very encouraging
5961275 we do not have any plan to introduce it immediately but after achieving the critical level of frequency spread the next step would be to introduce a bigger aircraft we want to do that
5961276 it is a good development for the industry as it would stimulate more indians to travel
5961277 government has opened greenfield airports in bangalore and hyderabad delhi and mumbai are going through refurbishment we are very encouraged by all these
5961278 we know that indians are among our ardent readers however we dont have plans now to have a hindi version of our website due to huge expenses involved
5961279 if we can do it economically in the future we will consider opening our website in hindi language
5961280 thanks to a decades efforts peoples daily online has made itself one of the most authoritative comprehensive and influential websites and a disseminator of information
5961281 peoples daily brings you the latest news dispatches of policy information and resolutions of the chinese government and major domestic news and international news releases from china
5961282 it reflects the views of the chinese people and the government
5961283 rising inflation and the rbis attempts to combat it through monetary tightening are leading to fears of the investment boom in india cooling off
5961284 the relentless rise in the flow of fresh capital investments reflects india incs confidence in the continuation of buoyancy in the consumption demand
5961285 it is not a very significant burden to make them cancel their fresh investment plans or stall those under implementation
5961286 our close monitoring of projects through the cmie capex service shows an acceleration in the announcement of fresh investment
5961287 in fact some of the industries are expected to witness a major acceleration in capacity addition in fiscal 2008 09
5961288 its more of a high stakes game than it was in the past
5961289 boards are more risk averse when choosing ceos it makes it harder for young people to be promoted to that level
5961290 the judge today correctly found that it was unlikely that the cfaa would apply to security researchers giving an academic talk
5961291 a presentation at a security conference is not some sort of computer intrusion its protected speech and vital to the free flow of information about computer security vulnerabilities silencing researchers does not improve security the vulnerability was there before the students discovered it and would remain in place regardless of whether the students publicly discussed it or not

5961296 ga in gesprek over de vorm zodat het daarna weer over de inhoud kan gaan
5961297 op inhoudsniveau dat betekent niet dat de jongeren meer beslissingsbevoegdheid moeten krijgen wel dat we hen serieus moeten nemen
5961298 om de inhoud dicht bij de mensen te brengen de vorm mag niet belemmerend werken

5961341 innocent buyers of defectively constructed homes should not be denied redress on the implied warranty simply because of the form of the business deal chosen by the builder and vendor
5961342 in todays marketplace as this case illustrates there has been some shift from the traditional builder vendor model to arrangements under which a construction entity builds the homes and a sales entity markets them to the public
5961343 in some cases the builder may be related to the vendor in other cases the vendor and the builder may be unrelated
5961344 but whatever the commercial utility of such contractual arrangements they should not affect the homebuyers ability to enforce the implied warranty against the builder

5961346 quite a few of them never supported the mayor from the very beginning

5961357 unfortunately mr sanchez chose to engage in a course of conduct that caused uniformed officers to react and respond like we train them to do
5961358 the only person responsible for mr sanchezs injuries is mr sanchez himself

5961360 in my opinion what i get from people who are telling me he was stumbling falling down on his head and dropping his gun he must have been going into diabetic shock theres no question in my mind about it
5961361 every news article so far has said my brother was shooting at the police
5961362 my brother had an ar 15 assault rifle at home if he really wanted to kill people he would have taken that and shot all the people he wanted to
5961363 for me its about making sure the truth comes out
5961364 the subject made an aggressive movement with the gun and officers shot the suspect
5961365 we wish we knew their family history but we dont
5961366 immediately i knew because he built it himself i completely broke down and freaked out and called my parents and my brothers
5961367 my dad is completely distraught hes 70 years old hes just confused on how this could happen so quickly and what happened my mom didnt like to hear he was shooting at police and we know that is impossible
5961368 impression of the gunmans behavior is that the gunman was suicidal
5961369 they may not have seen it anyway its one of those situations where the police sort of have to do what they think is right
5961370 i can definitely understand how they might think that he was putting others in danger and react that way

5961379 all of us in china have paid a lot to stage these olympics and tanning my skin brown is part of that effort

5961381 its quite normal to go to the beach and see most young women dressed this way
5961382 i feel extremely proud to be a chinese cheerleader and it is a special honor to perform with the spaniards in the international troupe
5961383 the chinese cheerleaders are all beautiful girls wearing fashionable bikinis and this is probably the first time theyve appeared in public in such highly revealing clothes

5961420 support george bush 95 percent of the time keep spending 10 billion a month for the war in iraq
5961421 its game on the moneys in the bank were going to have a huge financial advantage let the mccain campaign chase us around the country if they can find us
5961422 he former president chiluba was very saddened by the news that the country had lost president mwanawasa to the stroke although president mwanawasa has been unwell since june 29 we were hopeful and prayerful that he will fight the effects of this stroke and pull through so he was very saddened that president mwanawasa died and he has expressed his condolences to the acting president his excellency mr rupiah banda and he has wished his deepest sympathy to the first family to the government to the mmd and to the country at large
5961423 they had a very longstanding relationship that dates back to their days in ndola a town on the copper belt they worked together he chiluba was in the trade union and president mwanawasa was a lawyer and he was consulted several times in those early days at the dawn of democracy in 1990 they forged a friendship for the service of this country president chiluba was president and mr mwanawasa was his vice in the party and when president chiluba won elections in 1991 he invited mwanawasa to be his vice and mr mwanawasa was the vice president of the republic so they have a very strong longstanding relationship
5961424 even when president mwanawasa resigned as vice president and after so many years and even when president chilubas terms came to an end he still went to president mwanawasa and called upon him to be his successor he chiluba campaigned for him and president mwanawasa assumed office in 2002
5961425 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5961426 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5961427 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5961428 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5961429 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5961430 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5961431 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5961432 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5961433 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5961434 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5961435 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5961436 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5961437 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5961438 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5961439 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border

5961455 the position of environmentalists that over the course of some 100 000 years peoples separated by geographical barriers in different parts of the world evolved into ten different races with pronounced genetic differences in morphology blood groups and the incidence of genetic diseases and yet have identical genotypes for intelligence is so improbable that those who advance it must either be totally ignorant of the basic principles of evolutionary biology or else have a political agenda to deny the importance of race

5961468 this has gone through with west brom and we are very pleased
5961469 the thing that impressed me the most over the past couple of days is micahs attitude which has been great
5961470 there has been speculation that when players drop down they wont be motivated to play for the under 21s but that has not been the case with micah at all
5961471 players have to be able to step up and step down they do it abroad and we have to get into that mentality of doing it here
5961472 that will serve micah in good stead he cant be in the wilderness of not being in the seniors and not be in the under 21s and be in between the two squads
5961473 this is what we are trying to build towards players coming to the under 21 side and seeing it as a pathway back to the senior squad
5961474 if they do well here and do well for their club as he has done then they will get their chance
5961475 this is the last friendly before the qualifiers and there will not be a lot of experiments but i have the possibility to get to know better some players like emile heskey
5961476 it is the first time ive picked him in the squad i followed him last season for three or four games and he didnt play well and for me he was not fit
5961477 but i saw his last game and he is fit now and looked in very good form
5961478 i think he is an interesting player but i must stress the door is not closed for peter crouch
5961479 i have a squad and all the players are important i will decide the first eleven but it is the last friendly match before the qualifiers
5961480 what am i looking for i want to see england play like a team with spirit and without fear and show big personality
5961481 you have to come see and bring your camera so you can write about it
5961482 they thought that i was just playing around and not paying attention during the hearing test but in fact i simply could not hear
5961483 when i first started playing in bands in high school i could never hear what the horns were playing or what the singer was singing instead i developed a really solid sense of time and just learned to dig into the groove as tight as possible as well as memorize the song i think that in a sense my hearing loss really made me respect the groove and tempo in a way that i might not have had i been able to hear
5961484 i grew up in a house where my mother was always playing music sometimes she would need to play a gig or have a rehearsal and a babysitter would not be available she would take me with her give me a tambourine or a shaker and i would play along i just learned to keep time and fell in love with drums and percussion i never really thought about the fact that there was something unconventional about that until people started to mention it to me
5961485 its a challenge in terms of keeping the tempo correct when you have so many elements happening at once you really need to keep the beat solid for an ensemble this large there are some songs with arrengements so busy that i hardly play any fills i just lay back and keep the beat going
5961486 i wear earplugs from the moment i walk into the club i have 3 pairs of westones musicians plugs and i wear them religiously when i play with kelley polar i use headphones that block out 25 decibels and i get a direct line in from the sound board with a volume control since i need to be playing in time with a computer thats triggering samples strings etc and dont want to blast my ears out
5961487 at this point in terms of where science is at there is no cure for the kind of hearing loss that i have hopefully some day theyll put the kind of money into research that is needed however in the meantime ive got to make the most of what i have i have never taken my ears for granted and i do everything i can to protect what i have left

5961501 theres a big part of america that really believes that there is a war on terrorism and that we need to finish up
5961502 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to afghanistan and got educated about afghanistan and iraq he came back and said some really nice things so as far as leadership and patriotism goes i think its really important that those things have to take place and i think hes the best democratic candidate weve had since bill clinton and thats coming from a democrat

5961533 i dont know but i can tell you i sure sleep well at night
5961534 now that shes gone we kind of have to do it ourselves
5961535 we have to go that extra step we have to wake up earlier to prepare to wash our clothes and all that to cook our own breakfast
5961536 everyone in my family thought ray was going to be the first one to actually go and make it
5961537 but ever since the decision i guess it fell on me to put my last name out there like to try to make a name for myself and my family
5961538 i havent gotten into great details with him but i know that hes handling it very adult like
5961539 hes probably handling it better than what i would if something had happened to my mom but thats ryan
5961540 obviously the sooner the better for me my goal is to be back for the first game
5961541 so what if i dont get a hit it was uplifting for me and the rest of the guys this win can be credited to that
5961542 it gave us a chance to put things into perspective
5961543 i will let it play out as long as possible knowing that number of kicks will be the best indicator because we will create pressure situations along the way
5961544 and again it could be a possibility that they both kick one could be long field goals the other could be short but the numbers will help us with that
5961545 its a whole other mind set when you are playing quarterback

5961548 i would think that three tickets now seems to be working all right and with the economic conditions that our constituents are facing i dont think adding this additional burden to their already beleaguered economic existence is a good idea
5961549 it is going too far in terms of our approach of collecting revenue from scofflaws because there are a lot of people with two tickets who are willing to pay their tickets who feel they didnt have adequate notice
5961550 would have to be convinced to vote in favor of something like that its not hard to get two tickets

5961671 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
5961672 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
5961673 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
5961674 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
5961675 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
5961676 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
5961677 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe

5961686 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5961687 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5961688 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5961689 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
5961690 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
5961691 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
5961692 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
5961693 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5961694 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5961695 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened
5961696 when i read the initial claims about david they just didnt ring true that a simple country bloke who had a decent family should become a supporter of terrorism
5961697 i sent money to a trust account to david amp squo s solicitor david mcleod in adelaide

5961702 he is a transit passenger and it is the responsibility of the airline to take him to his final destination
5961703 its clear that this is a wake up call not just to governments but to the community he said in sydney

5961712 this submission from the dpp australias primary prosecutorial agency shows that the afp ignored the ground rules for obtaining early high level legal advice lawyer rod hodgson said
5961713 they apparently orchestrated a campaign to keep the dpp in the dark and feed snippets of misleading information for as long as possible
5961714 when the afp were running out of time they put enormous pressure on the dpp to give support for the laying of charges and even then on incomplete and misleading material mr hodgson said
5961715 our primary focus is on informing doctors of the changes so they can review the treatment of patients currently on avandia or avandamet in accordance with the changes to the product information dr elliot said

5961733 it should have warning lights its right up to the nearside lane and lorries coming down in the dark could clip their mirrors or have to swerve out
5961734 i was driving down there in the dark and it seemed to loom out of nowhere
5961735 it feels like the corner is sticking out so i pulled out a little to go round it
5961736 its illegal for it to be there advertising is not allowed on the highways
5961737 we are going to send someone up there in the next 24 hours to have a look at it and when he has seen it we will know what action to take
5961738 unfortunately we have not been able to get in contact with the client so we cant comment
5961739 i consider him a friend but because of his issues with public employee retirement and he keeps voting against any bill related to education instead of complaining i just threw my name in the hat
5961740 when were dealing with unfunded liabilities that are the size of the permanent fund lets just say there were billions of reasons i felt compelled to vote for that one
5961741 i realized i probably dont stand a chance but i figured id get my name out there this time and if im still simmering in another year ill start earlier
5961742 i think the difference is my experience and what ive been able to do for the district ive put in the hard work and i think ive done it honorably
5961743 the grant resources are either staying stagnant or even decreasing in some cases
5961744 more and more seniors because the costs are going up are relying more heavily on organizations like this one
5961745 i dont like to whine and i work hard keeping our head above water
5961746 its not just putting the meals in a bag and throwing them out there
5961747 it does take time and thought processes to get the right meal to the right person
5961748 we have the funding this year to help our seniors and our disabled veterans
5961749 going door to door through these neighborhoods has given me so much more information i think its important that the very first thing i do if i win in november is to have a town hall meeting at the downtown palmer depot i want to hear what people need
5961750 there was a desire for stronger leadership and a stronger vision for district 13
5961751 i think just recognizing the ability of one person to create change from that first internship opportunity the world was opened up to me as far as what one person can do with their life
5961752 we didnt make it as far as we hoped with that
5961753 has shown dismal support of local issues that would enhance the availability of goods services and recreation
5961754 hes been in my office ive been in his office he knows where i was with the school funding palmer water and sewer even the palmer depot
5961755 the whole letter is difficult for me i dont know what to say
5961756 anyone can say change we have so many projects going on right now that are very difficult and that took years of work to get to the point theyre at right now
5961757 a fresh set of eyes is not the thing you want right now what you want is an experienced person who has been through this extensively and knows it extensively
5961758 i was happy to see him he spoke with me i shook his hand
5961759 his recollection was obviously influenced by his level of intoxication
5961760 unstable on his feet fails to walk in a straight line

5961763 if people think im perfect or that my familys perfect theyve got the wrong impression if this has any repercussions on my being mayor i have no one to blame but myself hopefully the voters can look at my record in office and judge for themselves
5961764 sometimes as im drifting towards sleep in the beginnings of that dissolution i wonder where i am when this is and realize that at these moments i could be anywhere anytime for all i know eight and napping in the trailer my broken arm in a cast or thirteen at night clutching a pillow to my neck or twenty in the arms of my boyfriend or twenty seven in the arms of my husband or thirty three next to my imaginary daughter at every place in the whole spinning shape that is my life when i am falling asleep i am the same person the identical awareness the same fuzzball of mind the same muck of nerves all along the line i forage through my life and everywhere there there and there it is only me in it the very same me the same harmless lump the same soggy weirdo the same sleeping breathing bun

5961829 shell canada has now received all necessary canadian regulatory approvals to proceed with the acquisition of duvernay
5961830 shell believes the best solution to help with coastal preservation and assist the states and community that support oil and gas production is outer continental shelf federal revenue sharing
5961831 these projects will protect their oil and gas infrastructure and without that protection who knows what their long term liability will be

5961833 its quite possible the bg offer may take some months to get all the regulatory approvals
5961834 no point in putting out someones estimate of what its worth when well know the answer in as little as another month

5961836 it is regrettable that events have caused us to review our shareholding and whether it is appropriate that the virgin brand should remain linked to virgin nigeria

5961840 shell is taking a pause from its planned drilling activity in the klappan this year
5961841 were doing this to have some dialogue with the newly elected tahltan central council and leadership from the tahltan band council and iskut first nations
5961842 first and foremost were listing to what the tahltan and iskut first nations have told us
5961843 for an open dialogue to occur it would be beneficial to have a pause in drilling in 2008
5961844 at this point its an experiment and a risky one
5961845 the people of the north are saying we will not be your lab rats we will not be your guinea pigs

5961853 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
5961854 but it should be one of his best episodes out of his career too he got to kiss me
5961855 the reason torchwood has gone down so well in america which tv executives should look at is the fact that their audience isnt uptight
5961856 its the executives who are treating the audience like theyre uptight because theyre pandering to programming for one specific audience and forgetting about everyone else out there
5961857 the stories have changed there are stories that people can actually relate to
5961858 a lot of people who argue that the stories are too risque theyre too in your face theyre too heavy for young people theyre afraid of dealing with those situations and theyre afraid of seeing real life on television what were doing is actually what people deal with in their everyday life we just do it in the realm of science fiction
5961859 i like the writers to create the story and create the fantasy for me so that i can then go and try to make it work but if im on set and were doing it and a director will ask me to do something that is completely out of context from what jack would do or what any of them would do we can actually say something
5961860 the producers trust enough and we know the characters well enough that we just know they wouldnt do or say something
5961861 as an expression of somebody who calls himself a minister of health its a very unhealthy statement
5961862 i mean where does he come off where does he appoint himself as a moral judge of professionals who he doesnt understand and knows nothing about
5961863 is it unethical for health care professionals to support the administration of drugs that are of unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed
5961864 so contrary to what mr clement might think were actually encouraging abstinence
5961865 my question to him is how does it affect you on a personal level that you should be so lacking in compassion for people
5961866 people have realized that when addiction touches their own lives in particular they realize that they really need a tool kit to help an addict and it should include injection sites
5961867 i almost feel a certain amount of pity for the guy clement because i think he doesnt seem to grasp just how sophisticated the level of discussion has been thats gone on around ethics
5961868 to just suddenly enter into the level hes entered this and think that he can sway the canadian medical association people with a few comments i think is very naive of him
5961869 too many canadians have seen the ugly face of drug crime
5961870 theyve had junkies break into their homes to fund a quick fix theyve seen young thugs dealing in schoolyards and getting more kids hooked
5961871 the origin was in germany at the turn of the 20th century
5961872 in america workers comp took root later in the 20th century
5961873 from the start it was designed to cover most non agricultural employment where there is a valid employer employee relationship
5961874 this insulates companies from the massive awards a plaintiff can win in other kinds of court
5961875 from the outset of the workers comp system an exclusive remedy rule has applied which severely limits the right of the employee to sue an employer for negligence
5961876 the injured worker has all of their medical expenses covered without deductions or co pays
5961877 doctor bills hospital bills prescription drug bills all of that is supposed to be covered
5961878 after a waiting period which varies by state and is never over seven days
5961879 workers comp covers all the medicals and indemnity expenses for the lifetime of the claim
5961880 there are rules in each state defining limits to benefits for injuries not deemed permanent in virtually all states the injured worker and their insurer can agree to settle a claim leaving the insurer without any further open obligation in some states many if not most permanent cases are settled
5961881 what are often not covered or covered but with often complicated exclusions are mental claims and disease claims such as cancers from exposure to toxins
5961882 generally these are not covered but court decisions have addressed these issues in virtually all states and these decisions rather than the language of the law tend to govern
5961883 the most common ground for rejecting claims which can only be done by the insurer is that the injury was not caused by work
5961884 a proficient adjuster should be able to make that determination perhaps with the help of a doctor who inspects the worker
5961885 in many states the adjuster can delay making such a decision for months
5961886 and if the adjuster decides then to deny the claim the already paid benefits to the worker are not returned
5961887 under workers comp law a person is not entitled to get benefits unless they are an employee
5961888 im not arguing about medical issues im not arguing about doctors im arguing that this person is not an employee
5961889 and the rules set largely by court decisions vary by states
5961890 typically an independent contractor is being paid to complete a job to complete a task and is not being paid by the hour
5961891 if i hire a painter to paint my house im not supervising that persons every brush stroke
5961892 injuries by undocumented workers are usually covered by workers compensation
5961893 the concierge desk the porters the superintendents the maintenance people are all typically employees of the building
5961894 a lot of employees come up with phony claims a lot of doctors support the phony claims some employers take advantage and dont report everyone trying to save premiums and fees
5961895 doctors dont always agree on a prognosis there is a fair amount of objectivity and there is a certain amount of subjectivity
5961896 as a result of this recommendation it appears that dr rainville would not sign paperwork to support a total and permanent disability claim
5961897 it appears at this point that dc district chief famolare begins to doctor shop
5961898 following that appointment dr mahoney then signs off on dc famolares paperwork declaring him totally disabled
5961899 even if compliance poses an incidental conflict with the defendants religious beliefs
5961900 if you love what you do and do what you love youll never work another day in your life
5961901 there are nowadays professors of philosophy but not philosophers yet it is admirable to profess because it was once admirable to live to be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts nor even to found a school but to so love wisdom as to live according to its dictates a life of simplicity independence magnanimity and trust it is to solve some of the problems of life not only theoretically but practically
5961902 its going to be a different feel because were doing five days
5961903 its not going to change its not a family show were still going to be on after 9pm torchwoods a family show if you think its appropriate for your children to watch it we just deal with issues of life but no its not going to be toned down were still going to be edgy because thats what we are
5961904 gt dropped out to be in the doubtless crappy law and order uk but thats just me now what do you think
5961905 with all due respect to cardiff city theres only so many options in a place of that size for stories compared to a huge city like london
5961906 but how many people are willing to make a commitment to watch something over five consecutive nights these days whats the dramatic point that cant be served by weekly episodes or are they relying on everyone recording it or iplayering it
5961907 it seems there is a communication gap between you people and se in the first place this guy i pointed at
5961908 if a person who has had a stroke can walk across a room i should be able to run 20 miles
5961909 when you run you delve a little deeper into yourself and empathize when they hit their wall and think i just cant do it
5961910 he is aging very gracefully healthy and smart much better than i did at his age he is national class
5961911 its training and leading up to a race for me
5961912 ive always had good pulmonary lung capacity its been my strength its carried me through a lot
5961913 it was kind of half hearted i was not prepared
5961914 i dont know exactly what it was that brought me back
5961915 thats a tough one a buddy of mine got me to run with him in the 2006 tucson 10 miler i did 1 07 and things snowballed from there
5961916 people who cant walk or dress themselves lots of stroke victims amputees hip fractures
5961917 i feel like a sore thumb in a piranha pool in this industry i dont like the way its all run by rich men in their 50s who went to private school its not something i want to be part of im going to retire and become a pedal taxi driver
5961918 the rational person is the one who strives always to increase his power to change passion to action and to secure for himself joy independence and serenity that are the true marks of freedom to achieve this condition however is to amend our emotions to master that in our nature which otherwise master us
5961919 there is only one true wisdom which is to increase our power and to ensure that in so far as it is possible the things that happen to us are also produced by us
5961920 all of those possibilities are there but what we want to do right now instead of looking at that part is find out who are our best football players lions coach rod marinelli said
5961921 well find out who are the best players and then you start shuffling them around
5961922 what people have to understand is that my role was a lot different i had to run the ball a lot when i got my opportunities to block i think i did well they needed to see me snap after snap after snap
5961923 i knew that was one of the things that was on me and i knew it wasnt true so i wanted to come in here and show them from day one that im a really physical blocker it was important for me to come in early and show them thats not a concern they should have
5961924 when he first came in here he caught everything in sight and that was exciting for me because when you have a fullback who can catch the ball out of the backfield thats something defenses really have to honor kitna said
5961925 we got into the pads and in his first couple of games he showed that he understands the game and hes not afraid to go in there and bang it around hes answered that question no doubt
5961926 he blocked very well he got his hat on the right guy thats no 1 but hes been physical thats not an issue with him marinelli said
5961927 you know a guy is smart is if you never have to correct him or if you notice him kitna said
5961928 typically if you notice a fullback hes doing the wrong thing he always seems to be in the right place
5961929 i have five mas felton said sternly referring to missed assignments
5961930 i can say all three of us are no 2s because none of has really separated ourselves
5961931 all three of us make great plays and make great blocks
5961932 when youre behind someone like javon you know hes going to get the bulk of the carries so its really all about being able to replace him and give him a breather
5961933 i feel like i can go out there and make plays i feel like ive got a different running style thats not exactly like jehuus and not exactly like javons and not exactly like a j or andres
5961934 i think i have more of a smooth style i guess i have one of those god given talents i can feel the hole and i feel which way to run its just a blessing
5961935 i had to have a screw put in and that kind of slowed me down
5961936 i had to wear a little brace in spring and it was effecting me i couldnt switch hands because i couldnt get a grip on the ball
5961937 we have handed the case to the police and also submitted our findings to our disciplinary board
5961938 it is an urgent need as we tackle changes in the international economic situation as well
5961939 this might appear a simple feature to a modern audience but from then on you didnt only play against the machine but also against human opponents
5961940 today the games market is at least as important as other branches of the entertainment sector like film or music with one difference the games market is booming
5961941 of course some games are bloody and they should not be in the hands of children but that does nothing to change their aesthetic qualities
5961942 mas quela altura ela j estava desconcentrada salto com vara uma prova muito t cnica acho que o sumi o da vara atrapalhou ela na concentra o saio daqui frustrado
5961943 i am glad martz is gone and you can tell him i said it too
5961944 i think he played me he was not honest with me as a man or as a coach and my position coach wilbert montgomery didnt have anything to say either nobody was telling me stuff
5961945 i was so happy to get out of here after the last game
5961946 playing for martz last year i hated it you dont understand how hurt i was sitting on the sidelines and not getting that many carries i mean i started the season with like 15 carries and then i got like five carries actually nine against minnesota i know they are a good run stop team but that shows you were scared of them that ticked me off how many starting running backs do you know get five carries in a game
5961947 i am happy to be back teammates were happy to see me i did not burn bridges with coaches or players it was like i was back and i never left
5961948 i had a bad game against the giants but it just wasnt me it was the line too
5961949 the past game i ran a little better but there were no holes so it looks like theres no running game but if we keep pushing the issue as a group we are going to get it going i have had a solid camp and hopefully it translates into a good season
5961950 when youve got guys like roy and calvin who are big and fast and can win in jump ball situations you want to give them a chance
5961951 you cant do that every play you have to be smart in how you mix it with the running game and make sure when you take your shot it counts
5961952 i know that stuff happens sometimes but catching routine fly balls should not be that much of a problem
5961953 i just didnt get back far enough maybe on that last one and made myself have to jump
5961954 i couldnt believe i didnt come down with it especially in that situation and especially twice in the game we need to make plays especially routine plays
5961955 i still have a ways to go but im going to get there
5961956 im just trying to get all my range of motion back right now
5961957 when that happens ill start playing catch but theres no timetable for that right now
5961958 im pleased with everything so far my hand isnt swollen any more and the feeling has returned to my fingers
5961959 i thought id be in toledo pretty much the whole year with maybe a september call up
5961960 id love to say hit but i wouldnt want my pitcher getting earned runs for something like that should that ball have been caught absolutely
5961961 he looks like a rookie at times other times he doesnt
5961962 i like him a lot that bat makes a loud sound as long as he doesnt outthink himself and goes the extra mile hell be good
5961963 i talked to him the other day and i told him i really like what i see you have a heck of a chance to be a good player but you need to play with more tenacity
5961964 hustle everything out play hard and show that i want to be here show i deserve to be here dont act like youve been here for a while
5961965 i thought he had very good poise and very good concentration on the task at hand
5961966 he might say it was special to beat the rangers but i doubt it was when all was said and done he handled it very well
5961967 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5961968 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5961969 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5961970 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5961971 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5961972 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5961973 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5961974 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks

5961983 this is fantastic i told nick if he ever could stay off the rail he might win something
5961984 and it looks like i was right nick has always had the talent to do something big it just took time to build up the strength and experience to get to this moment
5961985 wow what a night for new zealand what a night for michigan wow
5961986 it was a matter of finding a coach who not only could get me through the college life but also the international scene
5961987 ron warhurst had proven that with u m alum and canadian olympian kevin sullivan and fortunately for me ive been able to go a little bit past that its worked out beautifully
5961988 i married my girl sierra from michigan and weve built a home there and its somewhere where i hope to live for many many years to come
5961989 but i also look forward to spending good quality time in new zealand people always ask me when am i hitting home and i said when i get a medal it will be sooner than later because i want to take advantage of that and tour the country i want to show all the kids the medal and get a chance to speak with them i want to share this with the entire country and in michigan too
5961990 i know people look up to us for what we do but they forget we also look up to people too
5961991 we can admire people too you look at somebody like michael phelps and you can only be really appreciative of somebody who has worked incredibly hard to make themselves the best hes came to this olympics and won eight gold medals eight in like nine days
5961992 were just trying to win one and we have the whole olympics to play to get it done obviously a guy like michael phelps is special and amazing i admire him
5961993 you have to adjust to coming off the bench obviously its something totally im aware of as how things are on this team
5961994 i understood that coming in i think whats making this team effective is everybody on our team is really good in our own ways we have reasons to be on the floor at certain times and in certain ways
5961995 coach k has talked about situational things and how we approach it and when who gets used for what so we all know the ways we fit in im fine with this because i know there are certain situations for me
5961996 i am having fun but now we all recognize that things are going to get a lot tougher
5961997 you dont see anybody moping around here over things like time or touches were all in this together
5961998 we learned our lessons in what attitude we need to have to win this time around
5961999 its really a really fun environment and you get caught up in it
5962000 i think people forget that were sports fans too were just not only fans of our own game ive wanted to see as much as i can to take advantage of this opportunity this is a really different environment than what i usually am in
5962001 he has good presence for a young guy it looks to me like hes going to be very very good hes got extraordinary ability
5962002 i think you factor any way you can to have all of your possible weapons available to become as good as you can become and most especially at quarterback
5962003 he just looks the part of the returning quarterback from a good team
5962004 every time i go out there i feel that much better about myself

5962017 hes just being a little bit fine with the fastball
5962018 it just means were starting to do things in the right way
5962019 were making less mistakes were starting to believe in what were doing it just validates the work that weve done

5962024 he has done an unbelievable job coming from the environment he came from
5962025 he grew up in maryvale he could be in prison could be a drug runner could be this could be that hes done an unbelievable job of not being a victim
5962026 yeah im getting a little tired of it to tell you the truth
5962027 its phoenix not compton not detroit its not that bad we just didnt have much
5962028 ive got to catch quite a bit these last 10 to 15 games
5962029 i am going to be in there 80 percent of these games behind the plate
5962030 its been hinted all around without anyone outright saying it
5962031 i am starting to feel better i went through a funk there at 20 to 25 at bats but i am feeling better at the plate now
5962032 it happens its one of those things i felt awkward at the plate and tried to work through it i did make good contact
5962033 i am trying to get back on track if i do go up in september ill have very limited at bats
5962034 its pretty much the same situation i dont know what is going to happen next year
5962035 there is a 50 50 chance of me being in this organization next year
5962036 i hit some garbage on the left into a brush and chopped it out then i hit bad 3 iron on the same line and and figured that was out so i hit another but i found the right one and got a bogey
5962037 i wanted to go out and make birdies right away to widen the gap and get some breathing room
5962038 but after that i knew if i could just keep it in play
5962039 there were three or four of us in the running and i hoped i could put pressure on vomacka and smith
5962040 but i wasnt making the putts i was hitting well on the second nine but they were too
5962041 i didnt even want to think about not getting into the medal round and i would have hated to leave our fate in someone elses hands

5962045 just give us a straight tale and leave the salt and pepper on the side
5962046 thats what a dead man tastes like not rancid just this is pork but maybe it isnt if i served it to you now you might never know
5962047 we were on a trading voyage to vanatua off the east coast of borneo captain john chidsey battersea bill dawes and me
5962048 the vanatua village was high up in the fog and trees
5962049 bill and me preached over our trade goods and argued with the chiefs lieutenant we came to terms they had copra and thats what we wanted
5962050 when the bartering was over the chiefs lieutenant said now we must eat meat together it is our custom to bind a contract between men
5962051 two local beauties came in with a great platter of grilled meat and set it down in the dirt in the middle of the hut
5962052 but the slices of meat were arranged around a boiled human skull wearing captain chidseys hat
5962053 me and bill jumped up like wed sat in an anthill wed heard rumors that the vanatuans were cannibals but the company men said that about all the islanders even those that ate dog chidsey told us it was bunk
5962054 bill started swearing why did you kill the captain he said the only reason wed stopped on vanatua was chidsey had told us he and the chief were old friends
5962055 then the chief walked in with his warriors and their machetes
5962056 he has been here before and he has always caused trouble for us bill looked at me and i think even he was scared
5962057 what are your intentions said the chief have you come here to cheat us maybe to poison us he tapped the keg of trade rum sitting with the bales of cloth and the spools of brass wire and the unpolished knife blanks
5962058 we came here to trade said bill we had nothing to do with chidseys crime
5962059 bill sat down and i sat down next to him the hut was crowded with black eyed vanatuan warriors their naked machetes stuck out all around us i didnt move an elbow for fear of sticking myself on one of the damned things
5962060 and if we eat with you said bill we can leave with our copra
5962061 yes said the chief bill looked at me and nodded we had to do this thing the savages had already killed chidsey they would surely kill us too here was a slim chance to get away from here alive
5962062 and all we had to do was eat captain chidsey
5962063 bill took a slice of meat folded it and stuck it in his mouth he grimaced and coughed and chewed and swallowed and because bill was bill he took another slice and ate that too
5962064 i ate it it tasted like pork i think i said that already and thats all im going to say about it
5962065 they started laughing at us the damned savages the chief laughed too then he said kill them just like that
5962066 they were going to kill us anyway and they still made us eat that meat
5962067 bill jumped up and grabbed me by the arm and he bowled through the grinning warriors we made it outside i remember there was a fire pit i remember an indescribable carcass roasting over a bed of coals i think i screamed bill dragged me after him and the whole village came running after us
5962068 we got away or i wouldnt be telling you this now
5962069 two years later i ran into a man who said captain chidsey was living in the sandwich islands married to the chief of vanatuas daughter
5962070 so maybe me and bill didnt eat man flesh that night after all
5962071 i saw bill at pirros bar in kowlpoor a while later and told him the story he turned it around in his head a bit and then he said that wasnt pork
5962072 ive spent thirty years trying to get the taste of that meat out of my mouth pass the bottle
5962073 my diet has a lot to do with my getting into shape i have no sugar i dont eat fruit or even fruit juice because of the sugar i eat chicken and salmon and rice i eat avocados ill have egg whites for breakfast and sometimes turkey burgers for lunch i try to do just 1 200 calories a day it may sound like its not much but its actually a lot of food if you eat the right things

5962089 the department of foreign affairs and trade very much regrets the circulation of the biography by the australian high commission in wellington of an outdated internal draft which was a mistake dfat said in a statement
5962090 commissioner john dauth has apologised to ms clark who has accepted the apology
5962091 ms clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and she had had a bit of a laugh
5962092 newly formed governing arrangements with nz first and united future which happened soon after the 2005 new zealand election
5962093 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient miss clark said
5962094 i think it is a pretty minor thing i had a bit of a laugh
5962095 i thought it was a hoot and i dont propose to release the one i have on mr rudd
5962096 as i say if i was to have my cvs on other leaders fall off the back of trucks you would all have a lot of laughs as well

5962147 industrial action is looming we have been very disappointed with the quality of negotiations today and wed urge the state government to come back to the table with a new and improved offer
5962148 the state government has told us that their offer is a package deal
5962149 the offer of 9 75 per cent and the new student centred funding model for our schools remain on the table and frankly our members have rejected this

5962155 the supervised injection site undercuts the ethic of medical practice and sets a debilitating example for all physicians and nurses both present and future in canada

5962157 junkies and pushers dont belong near children and families they should be in rehab or behind bars
5962158 there is growing evidence that harm reduction efforts can have a positive effect on the poor health outcomes associated with drug use
5962159 is it true that supervised injections offer positive health outcomes i would not put it this way insite vancouvers safe injection site may slow the death spiral of a deadly drug habit but it does not reverse it i do not regard this as a positive health outcome
5962160 minister is off base in calling into question the ethics of physicians
5962161 we have an opinion based on scientific evidence the minister has come to a different conclusion
5962162 ive never seen such an offensive performance by a health minister
5962163 how dare he come to a meeting of professionals and scold them about their perceived ethical failings

5962167 this message goes beyond what ought to be an acceptable 10 per center
5962168 whats questionable is the ethics of a government that would allow vulnerable people to die without getting help
5962169 youre debating a policy and youre asking which political party or which political leader is on the right track

5962180 mr sanchez walked into the concert at old tucson studios on may 25 2003
5962181 frank sanchez the plaintiff made a series of really bad decisions and got himself injured and now hes trying to blame my clients
5962182 unfortunately mr sanchez chose to engage in a course of conduct that caused uniformed officers to react and respond like we train them to do
5962183 the only person responsible for mr sanchezs injuries is mr sanchez himself
5962184 sanchez has had four surgeries on the ankle will never have full use of it and will likely suffer excruciating pain for the rest of his life wrae said
5962185 innocent buyers of defectively constructed homes should not be denied redress on the implied warranty simply because of the form of the business deal chosen by the builder and vendor
5962186 in todays marketplace as this case illustrates there has been some shift from the traditional builder vendor model to arrangements under which a construction entity builds the homes and a sales entity markets them to the public
5962187 in some cases the builder may be related to the vendor in other cases the vendor and the builder may be unrelated
5962188 but whatever the commercial utility of such contractual arrangements they should not affect the homebuyers ability to enforce the implied warranty against the builder
5962189 we were shocked and dismayed that city and county residents were having to foot the bill for a private fundraiser
5962190 its unfair and wrong that citizens should subsidize a political event
5962191 do these same democrats want every city and town that barack obama visits to be reimbursed for these very same expenses
5962192 in my opinion what i get from people who are telling me he was stumbling falling down on his head and dropping his gun he must have been going into diabetic shock theres no question in my mind about it
5962193 every news article so far has said my brother was shooting at the police
5962194 my brother had an ar 15 assault rifle at home if he really wanted to kill people he would have taken that and shot all the people he wanted to
5962195 for me its about making sure the truth comes out
5962196 the subject made an aggressive movement with the gun and officers shot the suspect
5962197 we wish we knew their family history but we dont
5962198 immediately i knew because he built it himself i completely broke down and freaked out and called my parents and my brothers
5962199 my dad is completely distraught hes 70 years old hes just confused on how this could happen so quickly and what happened my mom didnt like to hear he was shooting at police and we know that is impossible
5962200 impression of the gunmans behavior is that the gunman was suicidal
5962201 they may not have seen it anyway its one of those situations where the police sort of have to do what they think is right
5962202 i can definitely understand how they might think that he was putting others in danger and react that way
5962203 stereotyped because of where he was but he was actually on his way to work about four blocks from where he stopped the vehicle
5962204 when the blood sugar drops quickly the body releases hormones to stabilize it

5962211 welcome to chilo a planet with corrosive rain crushing pressure and deadly heat fortunately fourteen year old timas lives in one of the domed cities that float 100 000 feet above the surface circling near the edge of a monstrous perpetual storm above the acidic clouds the temperature and pressure are normal but to make a living timas like many other young men is lowered to the surface in an armored suit to scavenge what he can timass life is turned upside down when a strange man crash lands on the city the newcomer is fleeing an alien intelligence intent on invading the planet and discovering the secret hidden deep inside the perpetual storm a secret that could lead to interplanetary war
5962212 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
5962213 the heroes of this great artistic labor tend to be semimonastic intro verts who like woods beloved henry james and gustave flaubert toil with the doors shut and locked in soundproof splendid isolation attentive to the subtle frictions among nouns and adjectival phrases
5962214 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
5962215 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
5962216 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
5962217 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5962218 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5962219 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5962220 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5962221 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

5962229 apa yang paling mengecewa dalam hal ini ialah mengapa bpr bertindak pantas sekali dalam mengambil tindakan terhadap kita sedangkan kita juga telah membuat banyak laporan terhadap bn tentang perbuatan rasuah mereka
5962230 kita mahu mengisytiharkan bahawa kita telah memberi penekanan terhadap ketelusan dan penubuhan sebuah kerajaan yang bebas rasuah sebelum kita menubuhkan kerajaan negeri
5962231 apa yang baru mereka telah bercakap mengenainya sepanjang masa kita hanya perlu tunggu bpr menyiapkan siasatan mereka tanpa sebarang campurtangan
5962232 in recent months the ira has employed car bombs extensively often with devastating success but also with an apparently high risk to civilians
5962233 yes we intend to continue with the car bomb tactic because of the length of warning we give on a car bomb prior to its detonation if the enemy act on the warning theres no danger to civilian lives the car bomb is used on property only and this is accepted even by the british army and ruc it is not an anti personnel bomb thats why we give warnings it does not serve our cause to inflict civilian casualties and all our operations whether against military or commercial targets are planned and conducted with this in mind

5962236 it has become increasingly and enticingly clear that our bodies are outfitted with an array of stem cells
5962237 according to several research articles published in just the last month adult stem cells may have a far more immediate impact on regenerative therapies than first imagined
5962238 certainly none of these reports is the final word on stem cell research but they each in their own way show how our understanding of the bodys capacity to heal is moving forward one small often molecular step at a time
5962239 the incredible promise of stem cell research to at minimum advance scientific understanding and perhaps ultimately to treat persons with devastating diseases gives moral force to efforts to conduct this research

5962266 at ata engineering our clients count on us to deliver accurate solutions to challenging vibro acoustics problems under tight schedule and cost constraints
5962267 the core sea capability in va one has played a key role in our analysis solutions for a number of years but the recent advances in fem bem and hybrid capabilities have allowed us to tackle a whole new range of problems we can now provide accurate force and stress as well as acceleration results across a broad frequency spectrum the ability to model the same problem in multiple different ways mixing bem and fem as well as sea also gives us the ability to better understand the response of very complex systems
5962268 va one 2008 0 continues esi groups commitment to providing our customers with the state of the art in vibro acoustic analysis methods
5962269 with the introduction of fast multipole methods our customers can now easily simulate the low frequency response of systems that were previously too large to be analyzed with traditional boundary element methods furthermore by combining fast multipole with other analysis methods in va one our customers can now create more accurate system level models of noise and vibration across the full frequency range

5962325 the story of pazhassi raja one of our first but least known freedom fighters appealed to me also because it offered tremendous visual possibilities in the backdrops of the forests and the wars we know about the high expectations people have on the film and are confident that we will be able to live up to it

5962328 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
5962329 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
5962330 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness
5962331 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke

5962348 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage
5962349 teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
5962350 higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
5962351 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
5962352 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
5962353 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
5962354 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
5962355 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties
5962356 the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence
5962357 evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity

5962359 the smartest and most successful people in our society use their brains and not their fists
5962360 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5962361 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5962362 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
5962363 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralizes their potential benefits
5962364 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolizing enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs

5962382 it is not a problem related to ethnicity or religion

5962390 this is not just serious for georgia but for the reputation of russia in the world
5962391 the alliance is considering seriously the implications of russias actions for the nato russia relationship
5962392 we have determined that we cannot continue with business as usual
5962393 we call on russia to demonstrate both in word and deed its continued commitment to the principles upon which we agreed to base our relationship
5962394 he was very shocked and doesnt want to talk about it in view of the ongoing police and garda investigations
5962395 we were searching for anything which may have been tossed from the hijacked car before the vehicle crossed the border
5962396 in view of that likely interpretation we considered that the comparisons should include a fair and representative selection of goods

5962423 for the past 25 years america has experienced a period of rising consumer debt
5962424 up to now the high debt levels have had a positive influence on the economy
5962425 the message we all hear is that its ok to spend more money its patriotic to buy more and that its perfectly normal to take on debt to do so
5962426 were already seeing what happens to the markets from a weakened mortgage market
5962427 this together with the new orders which we hope to securein the next few months will give us the stability to tradethrough this difficult period for the construction industry andeconomy in general
5962428 when they did that in california they had an 11 million litre tank that they partially drained every two hours
5962429 they had 30 people working around the clock and they force fed the whale with a massive tube not only do we not have the facilities to do that in nsw but the success rate of that method is only 2 to 3 per cent and it has never been tried on a humpback whale
5962430 it is likely only to distress or endanger the whale and to endanger those trying to carry out the feeding process
5962431 everyones working very hard to try and save the whale and to see if we can obtain assistance from international agencies

5962435 he was a very believable person and that sincerity rang true theres a connection that people get and understand that is genuine and he had that genuine sincerity
5962436 he was working on creating artificial rubber they did not want him to go into the armed forces because they needed him to produce things for our country and our armed forces
5962437 he expanded the business and we had every major chemical and petroleum company as well
5962438 he always tried to look at a problem from the other guys viewpoint and looked at the problem broke it down and saw what was going to help this guy the most that is what he was really good at

5962487 this was one of the most important postwar sculptures in l a and it really belonged at the museum

5962496 really source of proof please science observation proves you wrong and a habitual chronic pathological liar as well
5962497 on june 12 1980 a third explosive eruption produced 25 feet of stratification that amazed geologists successive layers are traditionally thought to require long periods of time to form yet upwards of 100 layers accumulated mostly between the nighttime hours of 9 and 12 while a plume swiftly ascended nine miles above the mountain wave after wave of pyroclastic flows began hurtling out of the crater and down the north slope each dusting the valley below with another lamination measuring from a fraction of an inch to over a yard in thickness each took from a few seconds to a few minutes to form
5962498 geologist steven austin described these pyroclastic flows as ground hugging fluidized turbulent slurries of fine volcanic debris they moved down the mountainside at hurricane speeds and left deposits of 1000 degrees f one would expect each deposit to be homogenized amp thoroughly mixed remarkably these high velocity slurries of red hot ash and pumice separated into coarse and fine particles of perfectly defined layers such features follow laws governing flows demonstrated in laboratory sedimentation tanks
5962499 similar thin layering appears in the tapeats sandstones of the grand canyon
5962500 yup you could explain to me that you have observed first hand the layering in your septic tank too im sure there is an analogy here but it escapes me at the moment do tell what is the connection
5962501 i suppose you did read darwins radio your choice of reading materials reveals a lot dawkins specialties are fiction and fantasy not observable science his much acclaimed among fools weasel analogy was a complete fraud youre clutching at fables in a last ditch effort to avoid the conclusion that there is a god to whom you will answer one day youre not ready for that
5962502 hey bj antibiotics kill bacteria not viruses you cant kill viruses with antibiotics and viruses dont mutate in response to antibiotics theyre unaffected sheesh i would have thought you would get it the first time you were corrected your knowledge of science is pathetic and youre a very dense slow learner
5962503 so we have layer upon layer fair enough of varying thicknesses of pyroclastic flows why is that such a big deal and yet again i gave to remind you that such layers are not sedimentary
5962504 yah and bears make big potty in the woods so what are you still beating that one trick pony i regret to inform you but your hobbyhorse is dead
5962505 are you a complete freaking idjit the point is that the aggregates were not only layered but segregated according to aggregate size what you have at msh is 25 feet of finely layered segregated aggregates laid down in 3 hours not a long series of separate volcanic eruptions one ringy dingy two ringy dingy if you cant comprehend the material go back to the nursery and retrieve your binky
5962506 for anyone who just tuned in see 7 wonders of mount st helens
5962507 compare the fish pig and human embryos which animals are probably more closely related and why

5962509 the reason it hasnt been discovered before is no right thinking paleontologist would do what mary did with her specimens we dont go to all this effort to dig this stuff out of the ground to then destroy it in acid
5962510 how many artifacts are needed to prove that man and dinosaur co existed it would seem to present a major difficulty for evolutionists to explain the representation in art or literature or in artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposely had never seen one alive one could surmise that perhaps they had merely come across fossils but surely they would not have had the necessary skills to assemble them and then to draw them or describe them as in life modern scientists have themselves occasionally placed the wrong heads on skeletons or combined the bones of more than one specimen this presents a problem if you believe in uniformism and evolution

5962522 then ill ask that if you cant change the way you speak and i cant change the way i react to just say please and thatll make things easier for us
5962523 im thrilled for my players im happy for our school and im ecstatic for the conference
5962524 disappointing for my guys we had a great season we put a lot into it we won some games we had some bumps in the road and actually that must have been the things that cost us
5962525 it was a very tough decision between odu and drexel
5962526 we were very much aware of the good road record that drexel had
5962527 but what impressed us more was the fact that within the conference odu had just performed admirably and come in second in the league and had a better inter conference record by a significant margin
5962528 i think people are going to be more shocked over teams that got in instead of us more so than why we did not get in
5962529 i think theyre going to look at some of these teams and say wow that team got in that disappoints me a little bit but what are you going to do
5962530 you look at some of the faces of your guys you know what they put into it
5962531 you know how much this is a big moment for them and it really didnt happen

5962537 to get an at large bid for our program means were moving in the right direction although we like to take it out of the ncaa committees hands so we wont be on pins and needles like we were today

5962551 muslims should fulfill jihad with the heart tongue and hand muslims use the heart in their struggle to resist evil the tongue may convince others to take up worthy causes such as funding medical research hands may perform good works and correct wrongs
5962552 traditionally in islamic countries women are not expected to read or write today muslim women are pursuing educations and new career opportunities while islamists call for a return to tradition many muslims embrace a mixture of traditional and modern ways
5962553 they are very conscious of their identity they know who they are and what they are and what they want a quality which we seem to have lost to a very large extent this is a source of strength in the one of weakness in the other

5962555 im my biggest critic whenever i go out with my friends to watch my film i keep looking for flaws i look critically the way i look in the film or the way i act
5962556 im not going to tell you whether ive asked mr bachchan to shave off his beard or not but for sure this is going to be his most startling makeover in recent times balakrishna who is also known as balki said
5962557 while abhishek will be given a more intrinsic personality change im totally changing mr bachchans look
5962558 actually cheeni kum was inspired by one scene in raj khoslas dostana where mr bachchan had confronted zeenat aman the look of utter disdain and sarcasm in his eyes remained with me thats how his character in cheeni kum was born
5962559 while in cheeni kum he was a character i had seen earlier in pa hes a totally different person it a very emotional father son story but the emotions wont be melodramatic
5962560 amitji will have no love interest his world revolves around his son will i borrow from mr bachchans real life relationship with abhishek no in fact i know them so well that ill make sure i avoid all references to their real life
5962561 my mother is very biased towards me my parents always wanted me to learn moralistic values as a child and even now i have been a big fan of my fathers films
5962562 i have watched my moms films but i was not comfortable people would judge her and i dont like anyone else judging my mother i am possessive about her
5962563 well i feel so silly i just have to stand on my head
5962564 they have to be trained over a period of time and there are not shortcuts we are short of about 400 pilots but with the measures we are taking we will make good the shortage in the next five years
5962565 the iaf has addressed the issue with emphasis on two aspects retain and attract we are carrying out a focused publicity campaign to attract the best to our fold
5962566 whilst we cannot match the salaries of the private sector we compensate by offering a challenging and fulfilling profession with an unequalled quality of life
5962567 we are seeking to improve promotion avenues by the implementation of the ajay vikram singh committee avsc recommendations
5962568 the number of officers leaving the iaf prematurely has reached the levels it was around six years ago we are not holding people back just for the sake of it

5962570 it is essential for an independent strong and respected judiciary and indispensable for impartial administration of justice
5962571 the cji k g balakrishnan has written to chief justices of all high courts to consider adopting the apex court judges practice of declaring their assets at the time of their appointment and every year subsequently
5962572 the high court judges may consider adopting a similar resolution in case it does not have a system of judges declaring their assets soon after the assumption of office and regularly updating the declaration made by them
5962573 it is essential for an independent strong and respected judiciary and indispensable for impartial administration of justice
5962574 the pre existing and universally accepted norms guidelines and conventions
5962575 at the time of their appointment every supreme court judge has to declare his assets thereafter if any property is purchased he has to give the information to me in a sealed cover
5962576 this must be the case with high court judges who would furnish the information to the chief justice of the high court concerned
5962577 there are statutory provisions in the us apex court on disclosure of assets by judges there is an urgent need that such provision should be implemented in india too
5962578 its a huge huge difference being an olympian means more than a commonwealth gold medalist to americans my sponsor reebok had a bit of a hard time at the us olympic trials and only had four athletes qualify to go to the games to represent the us
5962579 then at the games they havent had the greatest successes swedens carolina kluft one of their marquee athletes decided to pull out of the heptathlon as defending champion
5962580 for me to come through and pull out a medal in one of the key key events for them has just been huge the guy who signs my cheques todd klein said he received at least 50 emails from boston back where headquarters is so everyones very very happy that will pay off my mortgage that one basically so im very happy
5962581 obviously a lot of it is hinged on this olympic year i guess financially its a huge relief to do well and it will certainly help with the mortgage in auckland
5962582 im very happy its better than your average nine to five job in new zealand
5962583 you look at the rowers for example theyre very talented athletes and get by with next to nothing relying on sparc funding whereas i can earn some good prizemoney and ive got some very loyal sponsors who support me i really cant complain
5962584 nothing is signed or sealed yet but its looking promising it will be back in the big league
5962585 its the government who will decide what to do with it
5962586 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him

5962590 this is the fourth hijacking in a month we call upon the u n and the international community to take immediate steps to stop the worsening situation
5962591 of course we believe everyone should deserve the protection of this bill who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous

5962597 it gave us a chance to put things into perspective
5962598 obviously the sooner the better for me my goal is to be back for the first game
5962599 i will let it play out as long as possible knowing that number of kicks will be the best indicator because we will create pressure situations along the way
5962600 and again it could be a possibility that they both kick one could be long field goals the other could be short but the numbers will help us with that
5962601 now that shes gone we kind of have to do it ourselves
5962602 we have to go that extra step we have to wake up earlier to prepare to wash our clothes and all that to cook our own breakfast

5962609 unlikely to require the divestiture of heathrow unless the sale of gatwick or stansted is likely to be impractical or ineffective
5962610 aspects of government policy restrict or distort competition by contributing to the current capacity constraints at baas london airports
5962611 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
5962612 separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5962613 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports
5962614 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
5962615 this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
5962616 we have also provisionally found that there are competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5962617 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe that separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5962618 over time we would expect these to increase significantly in scotland where there are no similar capacity constraints we believe separate owners of edinburgh and glasgow would similarly improve their offerings
5962619 baa has argued to us that there is no scope for competition to develop so long as there are capacity constraints we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist certainly for longer than in a better functioning market
5962620 the earliest new runway capacity will become available is 2015 at stansted with no additional runway capacity possible at heathrow before 2020
5962621 while we accept that government policy and the planning regime have contributed to the lack of capacity we have found that baa as the owner and operator of these london airports has played a major role in not pressing for more capacity sooner and in planning terminal and runway capacity on a conservative and sequential process such that its plans for one airport have been influenced by its plans elsewhere we accept however that baa has been more successful in undertaking several smaller projects simultaneously
5962622 in scotland baa has until recently been noticeably slow to develop new routes at glasgow and edinburgh while at aberdeen its investment plans are regarded as unambitious despite relatively high levels of profitability at southampton it has shown a reluctance to respond to its customers demands
5962623 by the differences in approach to both airline customers and development between baa and owners and operators of regional airports
5962624 we have identified significant competition between several pairs of such airports with benefits which include lower charges development of new routes and a far greater responsiveness to customers in terms of capacity development we note that both manchester and london city airports have expanded successfully without explicit government support
5962625 in regard to regulation we have found that the civil aviation authority caa is constrained by the current statutory framework and that consideration needs to be given to bring it closer into line with those of other sectoral regulators such as energy water and telecommunications with better defined duties objectives and powers including the protection of the interests of consumers the promotion of competition and the ability to impose economic licence conditions
5962626 there is also scope for the caa to play a more active role in facilitating agreement between baa and the airlines by ensuring an appropriate framework for consultation which is currently seriously lacking
5962627 the significant problems in the baa airports market will not be solved overnight and changes in ownership would only be a first step in freeing up the market and providing greater scope for more flexible development
5962628 changes to regulation may similarly be important and there could be benefits available from a less prescriptive government policy on airport capacity development though we recognise decisions on such policies which are wholly for government will be taken in a broader decision framework
5962629 the commissions findings should be assessed in the light of the urgent need for new airport capacity and a modern regulatory framework as well as the need which we recognise for improved service from the airport operator
5962630 the findings state that the lack of runway capacity is a main reason for what it calls the current poor standards of service and the lack of resilience at times of disruption which results in regular delays
5962631 by calling not just for a fundamental restructure of baa but also for a review of the governments air transport white paper the commission risks delaying the delivery of new runways and making better customer service less not more likely
5962632 we will be seeking urgent clarification from the government of how it believes this reports findings can be reconciled with the air transport policy it established in 2003 and its current review of economic regulation
5962633 we note however that this is not the end of the competition commission process and we will continue to point out to the commission the many areas where we believe its analysis is flawed and its remedies would be disproportionate and counter productive
5962634 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time
5962635 in scotland the commission has apparently ignored the evidence presented by baa and supported by numerous respected third party organisations that clearly demonstrates that edinburgh and glasgow airports serve separate markets and therefore do not and would not compete regardless of ownership
5962636 er bara a fara lengra t og berja hann a eins
5962637 we think this figure could still be an underestimation until work starts and the money is provided each new estimate puts a question mark over whether funding will be available for the whole scheme
5962638 im sure im not alone in feeling that if the government had got on with it we could have kept to the original timetable with construction starting now and kept the costs considerably lower
5962639 this is a costly delay in terms of deaths and injuries on the road and also terms of the bill to the taxpayer
5962640 the a14 ellington to fen ditton scheme is a scheme of national and regional importance and we are committed to taking it forward subject to funding and statutory processes work is expected to start in late 2010
5962641 following an independent review of our major roads programme the highways agency has improved the way it estimates its schemes

5962670 were swimming in the amazon which is a rather famous river famous for piranhas and snakes and crocodiles and other things that could probably kill you is there any chance of us encountering those
5962671 no they dont want to swim in this area the water is way too dirty
5962672 before the race started i put my face under water
5962673 and then i come up and go this water tastes like bleep
5962674 you have a heel to the nose an elbow to the mouth constantly hands on the goggles
5962675 hes come in here and been himself and a lot of guys have jumped on his coattails
5962676 they enjoy him his personality i liked the personality this club was developing before he got here but hes accelerated it lightened the mood so to speak
5962677 they dont know how to relate to normal kids they dont know how to live in the real world
5962678 the first thing you have to do is qualify and we definitely have improved and it feels good to make those gains
5962679 the second part of the program is good finishes and weve had our ups and downs the last four races weve kind of gotten in the rut
5962680 but our job is clear cut and thats what were focusing on trying to do qualify for us and all the teams outside the top 35 you put so much effort on qualifying you lose a little bit on the race setup
5962681 getting into the top 35 is huge because it guarantees you being in the first five races next year when we can finally focus on our race effort instead of the qualifying effort
5962682 it would also make us feel so much better going into the winter
5962683 joe is the veteran that we need with the experience in cup to get the car qualified
5962684 he also opens the door that when we do get a second car we have a seasoned veteran as a mentor to possibly get a less experienced up and coming guy in the other car
5962685 i could stand up here all day long and try to explain it but its been a gift of a year
5962686 i just won a gold medal for the united states when you win a gold medal for your country youre like the statue of liberty
5962687 put yourself in my parents shoes or the shoes of anybody who has crossed over from mexico would you stay poor with no chance to improve yourself or find a way to go to the best country in the world any way you could
5962688 i guess that unless youre a native american somebody could say you dont really belong in the united states because almost everybody is from somewhere else but it causes arguments because almost everybody is a little bit racist
5962689 heres a wrestler who has a black eye and a gold medal but hes a mamas boy
5962690 the streets are paved with gold in the u s they really are
5962691 hes earned it with his consistent play and he has the best mastery of the offense at this point
5962692 i started last september and they only switched my phone lines on two weeks ago
5962693 everything has been a battle since everything has been a fight
5962694 we really must get up to 37 but with the hurdles of civil service the difficulty with getting people through the background checks and just finding qualified applicants the process has been much slower than expected
5962695 half of louisiana is under water and the other half is under indictment
5962696 over the course of many decades louisiana and new orleans have earned a reputation as being exceptionally tolerant of corruption
5962697 this fueled the demise of the local economy as it drove many companies away and kept them away
5962698 the assumption has been that if you want to do business here you need to set aside extra money to grease the wheels
5962699 we have some issues with corruption and bureaucracy but no more than any other urban environment
5962700 we have promised an end to corruption and incompetence in state government make no mistake about it this is a massive first step
5962701 this would rank louisiana among the top u s states for public disclosure rules and enforcement of those rules
5962702 people get so frustrated with the system here that its no wonder they opt to pay their around it
5962703 if i ran 9 6 shutting it down i wouldnt be nervous at all either

5962710 at what point is going after a goal not worth it
5962711 i was very much on the verge of that and through all the anxiety and financial stress and the stalking someone could make a really good case and say sheila it really wasnt worth it
5962712 but i always believed the blessing would come from being here i believed in this date being right here in 2008
5962713 i dont think im the most positive person in the world
5962714 shes tall blond beautiful young and happy im short dark cranky bitter and old
5962715 you pull the string and you dont know whether its going to start or not
5962716 you might need a bunch of pulls but once you do get that lawn mower going it cuts the lawn just as well as the new ones
5962717 one of the paradigms i was trying to break was the idea that women peaked athletically somewhere between 15 and 18
5962718 can you learn a sport in less than 10 years
5962719 i was very surprised i always thought id just work hard enough to do it
5962720 but when people asked have you ridden a horse have you fenced have you fired a gun no well good luck with that
5962721 i just wanted to see if i could do it
5962722 ive not really had a whole lot to say to tell you the truth
5962723 as to when ill be back on the practice field thats still to be determined obviously the sooner the better for me my goal is to be back for the first game
5962724 hot inflation and cool housing leaves the f o m c stuck in neutral for now
5962725 given the weak nature of domestic demand now and going forward it is likely that businesses will have increasing difficulty raising prices to consumers
5962726 its kind of our standard thing we have to talk im on track with him seeing how hes doing we probably talk more about life than football every time he does something right i let him know and every time he does something wrong i let him know
5962727 this is personal for me my pay is by them letting me come through those big gates for 14 years
5962728 wade gave me my first job and mike gave me my last job
5962729 you know man youve got to learn to be appreciative
5962730 i dont try to make a big deal out of it
5962731 some of the people who were very dear to me who helped me i still help them with some of their programs
5962732 with a small school youve got to try to get money in were going to do some more buildings some more facilities its not always about athletes well have better students too thats what we want to be an upper end division ii school

5962734 if you dont want to take time away from other work consider spending on extra hour a day writing for yourself with one of these types of projects in addition to your normal work
5962735 it was after a few weeks last year a big motivation to fight for the gold medal
5962736 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
5962737 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
5962738 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
5962739 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
5962740 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
5962741 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
5962742 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
5962743 cooking with biofuels such as wood dung and crop residue
5962744 open biomass burning associated with deforestation and crop residue burning
5962745 soot and other forms of black carbon could have as much as 60 percent of the current our italics global warming effect of carbon dioxide
5962746 black carbon particles only remain airborne for weeks at most compared to carbon dioxide which remains in the atmosphere for more than a century
5962747 over 400 000 annual fatalities among women and children are attributed to smoke inhalation during indoor cooking
5962748 instead of focusing on positive free market solutions to energy challenges speaker of the house nancy pelosi and the democratic majority are pushing for the proven failed tax and regulatory policies of the past
5962749 and they are cheered on by global warming alarmists like al gore who want energy to be much more expensive so americans use less
5962750 educate citizens on the hot air in the energy and global warming debates
5962751 the oil and gas industry has launched a frenzied attack on these balanced common sense protections
5962752 i am here today to urge the cogcc to do what is best for all of colorado and tell an industry that routinely uses and spills dozens of toxic chemicals to stay at least 300 feet away from public drinking water sources
5962753 with tens of thousands of more wells on the way we need strong protections to ensure the oil and gas industry does not jeopardize our health and safety
5962754 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5962755 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5962756 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5962757 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5962758 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5962759 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5962760 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5962761 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
5962762 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
5962763 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
5962764 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5962765 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5962766 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5962767 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5962768 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5962769 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5962770 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5962771 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5962772 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5962773 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5962774 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5962775 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5962776 the presentations have typically generated some open discussion about how we can reduce the amount of carbon emissions
5962777 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5962778 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5962779 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5962780 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5962781 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5962782 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
5962783 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
5962784 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
5962785 i have noticed weve been doing more passing using more three wides early on
5962786 we have the ability to give defenses tough matchups with our receivers in this league its all about making big plays its hard to go 80 yards in 12 plays teams that make the big plays win the game and we have difference makers on the outside
5962787 right now a strong part of our offense is the passing game
5962788 but were eventually going to have to get the running game going because when it gets colder out here youll have to run that ball
5962789 watching a lot of clips from three four five years ago they were in a lot of empty sets they were throwing all over the place especially with elway they threw their fair share of deep balls and empty sets
5962790 the history of the running game here has been a weapon
5962791 its feared by every defensive coordinator in the league that does open the passing game up a little bit teams are a little more hesitant to pressure us as much as other teams because we run the ball on third and 5 and get the first down some of the passing game is the result of our run game is so good
5962792 i think the broncos feel pretty confident that they know how to run the ball
5962793 i think youll still see the broncos run the ball 25 to 30 times a game it just might be three guys who get those carries

5962795 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5962796 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5962797 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5962798 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5962799 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5962800 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5962801 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5962802 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5962803 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5962804 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5962805 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5962806 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5962807 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5962808 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5962809 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign

5962817 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5962818 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5962819 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5962820 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5962821 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5962822 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5962823 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5962824 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5962825 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5962826 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5962827 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5962828 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5962829 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted

5962836 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
5962837 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid

5962839 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

5962850 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises

5962857 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5962858 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful

5962861 i determine that mr zentai is eligible for surrender to the republic of hungary and therefore he is remanded in custody
5962862 as the matters still before the court its not appropriate for me to comment at this stage
5962863 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
5962864 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
5962865 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
5962866 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
5962867 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
5962868 theres an element of individual responsibility we have all borrowed more than we should have done but many financial institutions were lending without thinking who they were dealing with or checking people properly
5962869 its now much more difficult for people to renegotiate their repayments and financial institutions which were quite happy to loan out during the good times have battened down the hatches and become more active doing home repossessions
5962870 it is absolutely vital that the government should intervene and require a proper code of conduct to be implemented by mortgage lenders
5962871 this should not just apply to the big banks but to the large number of secondary lenders who are using court action to pursue their debts in a very aggressive way
5962872 liberal democrats believe the level of growth of repossession orders suggests that we are on track for a repossession crisis very similar to the early 1990s
5962873 we discussed it at a board meeting on monday the directors were unanimous in their intention to invite the three supporters into the club to review the ban and bring about a satisfactory resolution i hope this will take place before this weekends fixtures
5962874 if cambridge united were in the league table for shooting itself in the foot they would be top of the premiership the club has messed this up from start to finish and now they are trying to get back a little pride but it is not going to work they must lift the ban unconditionally
5962875 if they are going to slap bans on fans for invading the pitch then they wouldnt have any fans left after the play off match against burton at the abbey last season
5962876 i would urge residents to ensure their homes are kept secure at all times

5962879 when i learned of their problem i decided to do something at least help them dig wells in their area which would provide a perennial source of water
5962880 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5962881 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it
5962882 the drive began in july and by the end of the month a total of 2600 was collected this money was sufficient to dig a bore well as well as fit an electric pump
5962883 i want to build rural maharashtra i want medical attention to be available to everyone and make physicians available in every village in rural maharashtra

5962886 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5962887 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5962888 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5962889 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5962890 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5962891 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5962892 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5962893 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade

5962896 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5962897 behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president
5962898 cannot quite bring himself to admit his own failure in judgment
5962899 senator mccain now argues that despite these costly strategic errors his judgment has been vindicated due to the results of the surge
5962900 in iraq gains have been made in lowering the level of violence thanks to the outstanding efforts of our military the increasing capability of iraqs security forces the cease fire of shiite militias and the decision taken by sunni tribes to take the fight to al qaeda
5962901 understand what the essential argument was about before the surge i argued that the long term solution in iraq is political the iraqi government must reconcile its differences and take responsibility for its future that holds true today
5962902 he is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5962903 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks he said that i have changed my position on iraq when i have not he said that i am for a path of retreat and failure and he declared that behind all of these claims and positions by senator obama lies the ambition to be president suggesting as he has many times before that i put personal ambition before my country
5962904 if we think that we can use the same partisan playbook where we just challenge our opponents patriotism to win an election then the american people will lose
5962905 the times are too serious for this kind of politics the calamity left behind by the last eight years is too great
5962906 for all of his talk about following osama bin laden to the gates of hell senator mccain refused to join my call to take out bin laden across the afghan border
5962907 instead he spent years backing a dictator in pakistan who failed to serve the interests of his own people
5962908 the club has increased over the last five years so that is partly behind the need for the new facilities
5962909 the school gave it to us if we could move it it took a while to get planning permission but we have done it now
5962910 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5962911 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5962912 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5962913 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5962914 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
5962915 there is a long list of people who deserve recognition for their contributions to our predecessor associations
5962916 this year it is my honor to formally recognize two families that had a significant impact on cfs and nwra
5962917 o g phillips and son in law larry smith from gooch brake and equipment company and gene gary and larry disano from century wheel amp rim dedicated a tremendous amount of their time and energy for the betterment of independent distributor associations
5962918 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
5962919 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
5962920 the big picture is we keep learning more about the contributions of environmental toxins to the chronic diseases of aging for which we never suspected an environmental cause
5962921 in a series of eye movement studies we showed that social experience has an impact on how people look at faces specifically we noticed a striking difference in eye movements in westerners and east asian observers we found that westerners tend to look at specific features on an individuals face such as the eyes and mouth whereas east asian observers tend to focus on the nose or the centre of the face which allows a more general view of all the features one possible cause of this could be that direct or excessive eye contact may be considered rude in east asian cultures
5962922 by disproving the long held assumption that face processing is universally achieved we have highlighted that the external environment including the society in which we develop is very influential in basic human mechanisms and caution should be taken when generalising findings to the entire human population
5962923 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage
5962924 teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
5962925 higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
5962926 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
5962927 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
5962928 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
5962929 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
5962930 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties
5962931 the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence
5962932 i am trying to carry on my business in a professional and non confrontational manner
5962933 a lot of us used to operate off jesus green until earlier this year but then the council introduced new by laws and offered up the la mimosa pontoon as a place to operate from closing off jesus green as an option for mooring
5962934 now our one viable access point is the so called
5962935 we are struggling now with both the la mimosa companies and scudamores and these steps are vital for us
5962936 so to have a punt there stops us from keeping a boat moored and it makes it really quite unsafe with the boat at an angle with a big gap on one side
5962937 i have received the photographs and complaints about the punt attached to the pontoon and will be talking to scudamores about it
5962938 the company have a licence to moor punts on the pontoon and i will have to check the terms of that licence before i speak to them
5962939 if we consider that it is a danger we will ask them to move the punt and we find most people are very good about doing that
5962940 i have not spoken to the conservators about this but if they wish to talk to us we will be happy to do that
5962941 we do hold a licence to moor punts on that pontoon but in relation to a specific mooring i have got no comment
5962942 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
5962943 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
5962944 nixon was bad enough without fictionalizing him and demonizing him

5962950 half our mistakes in life arise from feeling where we ought to think and thinking where we ought to feel
5962951 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5962952 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5962953 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5962954 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5962955 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5962956 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5962957 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5962958 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5962959 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5962960 join adidas and runners world at super jock n jill to meet and run with 2 time olympian todd williams and runners worlds bart yasso

5962962 where there is an outsourcing deal with transfer of people it is much more likely to be successful if those people join the new company with the right support and are optimistic about their future
5962963 none of them will have chosen to join the new employer so special efforts have to be made to win the support of the workforce and allay their natural fears
5962964 greg will work closely with atdynamics fleet customers to ensure best in class fuel efficiency
5962965 his leadership and experience are tremendous assets as we bring to market our trailertail drag reduction technology and additional trailer aerodynamics equipment
5962966 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
5962967 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
5962968 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
5962969 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
5962970 to which i nodded out of sheer ignorance and bewilderment
5962971 apparently thinking i was fool enough to believe him deaf he continued to burrow into my ear all the while parroting
5962972 after somehow duping me into sitting down he crept around back rammed my head against the seat back and began to scoop
5962973 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5962974 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5962975 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5962976 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5962977 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5962978 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5962979 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5962980 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5962981 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5962982 what this is if you will is a campaign that were running
5962983 my overall impression is that sun has seized upon a legitimate here stemming from the usual fud surrounding the rationalization and integration of two such daunting product portfolios oracle and bea and more uniquely the purported price increase oracle announced for weblogic in july
5962984 sun is hoping to make some inroads with existing and potential weblogic customers that may find oracles road map and pricing structure too daunting
5962985 over the years every time there is a major election we have had people attempt to put up a listing we catch them very quickly
5962986 when we see these listings we definitely take them down
5962987 its possible that someone would put a listing up its possible to be up for a couple of hours before we catch it its possible that for a brief period of time something might actually be visible on the site
5962988 we are very clear if you engage in illegal activity on our site we absolutely will share information with law enforcement we provide testimony in court
5962989 and what this person was proposing was probably not so feasible unrealistic
5962990 i dont think it will happen more and more as the elections are approaching
5962991 its not anything thats widespread or cause for concern in any way
5962992 people are just looking for an audience they are really using that listing as an opportunity to put their opinion on there
5962993 we have had instances that would be similar in nature where we have sports fan who are really unhappy with the performance of their favorite team and they may try to list the coach for sale as a way to express their unhappiness with the performance of their team
5962994 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5962995 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5962996 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5962997 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5962998 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
5962999 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
5963000 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness
5963001 using a credit card to pay for your education is absolutely the worst financial decision you can make
5963002 we eliminate homes and cars all the time due to price but then dont go through the same exercise for college
5963003 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
5963004 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
5963005 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
5963006 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
5963007 pay any price bear any burden in the defense of liberty
5963008 i thought we were through with all this in college
5963009 die resonanz auf unsere aktion und die spendenbereitschaft zeigen deutlich dass die menschen hierzulande sehr wohl bereit sind sich f r die benachteiligten regionen der welt in die riemen zu legen
5963010 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5963011 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5963012 youre taking the most active people in a national political party and putting them all under one roof which creates the potential for a lot of volatility
5963013 with 15 000 journalists on hand if anything goes wrong its going to be hugely amplified
5963014 can you turn the four days of the convention into a 10 or 12 day story
5963015 he can adjust his final decision based on the obama ticket
5963016 has a habit of straying off message and making impolitic comments
5963017 pretty deep knowledge of pretty much every big foreign policy question
5963018 obama has shown himself more not less in need of an attack dog able to engage mccain on national security
5963019 e vents in georgia and pakistan have made the prospect that obama will choose
5963020 if obama wanted to make a truly big statement before the convention he might want to risk alienating democrats by picking a republican running mate
5963021 than by choosing a member of the other to be his running mate
5963022 fill the bill of the excitement of the newcomer on the national stage
5963023 p ick a running mate who is a conservative white guy or a general or a republican
5963024 obama is likely to choose someone relatively safe and avoid taking a chance with a game changing selection
5963025 someone who would fill perceived holes in his r sum
5963026 who would reinforce his promise of change or one who might help him win a contested state
5963027 trying so hard to be perfect that it is stultifying
5963028 if obama gets elected and there is nothing funny about him it wont be the economy thats depressed it will be the rest of us
5963029 en el segundo set levantamos el pie del acelerador ya sab amos que gan bamos
5963030 ten amos otro partido por delante y est bamos diez puntos arriba no ten a sentido desperdiciar energ a
5963031 ahora que ganamos tenemos una gran responsabilidad y vamos a hacer nuestro mayor esfuerzo para ganar
5963032 estoy muy feliz y se lo dedico a mi familia y a mi pa s
5963033 quiero que sepan que vamos a dar todo lo mejor para seguir con la medalla de oro viene un gran equipo y esperamos jugar bien
5963034 si ganamos mi medalla tambi n se va para brasil
5963035 the acquisition of gms adds proven engineering capability complementary technologies and exciting opportunities for accelerating growth in the wider homeland security market through our law enforcement and national security business
5963036 this generation of prosperity had put millions of americans in new homes and millions of new cars on our roads
5963037 president richard nixon also called for greater efficiency standards at the federal level and for exploration of energy using the best options they had at the time extracting oil from shale and tar sands and developing cleaner coal technology
5963038 but when the same demagogues in the middle east who created the supply shortage decided to increase supply once again all the initiatives to use less and produce more energy were abandoned now 36 years later we again face a crisis an oil crisis a carbon crisis and a conservation crisis
5963039 the vehicles we drive have gotten bigger heavier and less efficient our homes have gotten larger and require ever more power to heat and cool our lives have become filled with new technologies that have changed the world for the better but increased the thirst for greater quantities of energy
5963040 this emergency far more complex than the one we faced three and a half decades ago harms our economy threatens our national security and pollutes to our environment
5963041 we are here today to accept the challenge of creating a clean energy revolution
5963042 the imperative is to end the drain of the american treasury both public and private which flow to the hands of volatile governments who control the worlds oil supply ultimately our vision is to bequeath to our children and our childrens children the livable planet that they deserve
5963043 if past is prologue and it is we know that this clean energy revolution will be complicated
5963044 so here in las vegas on august 19 2008 we are gathered gathered to share what we know where we are and what we do next
5963045 today in nevada there are 57 operating renewable energy projects producing 400 megawatts of electricity
5963046 our host the university of nevada las vegas is known for its high energy basketball and in the future it will be known as the leader in clean energy
5963047 look to nearby nellis air force base and you will find the worlds largest photovoltaic plant which provides more than 25 percent of the bases power
5963048 the first geothermal plant in america was built in nevada in 1984
5963049 unfortunately further work this year has been blocked by those creating a distraction by insisting that we talk about nothing but coastal drilling
5963050 even then it will be a drop in the global bucket
5963051 when people in the future look upon the polluted world of 2008 they will see a partnership of two politically differing individuals who came together to show responsible leadership
5963052 oil will be one part of our energy puzzle for years to come as we develop and produce the technologies that will one day render it unnecessary
5963053 congress should pass a long term extension of tax incentives for private sector entrepreneurs who are standing by ready to invest billions of dollars in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects
5963054 all of this will happen if we grasp the enormous economic opportunity this shift to renewables will create
5963055 for example if just 20 percent of our nations power came from renewables by 2020 we would create hundreds of thousands of direct jobs and save consumers many billions of dollars in lower bills
5963056 if we choose to embrace this challenge we can fundamentally change our world which will benefit every creature and person that inhabits it
5963057 we are taking the results and recommendations of this energy summit to the democratic and republican national conventions
5963058 and when we meet again next year i have every expectation that we will do so with a president a congress and a nation finally ready to fully embrace the great energy opportunities that lie ahead
5963059 mrs lawrence has a passion and the talent for teaching and incorporates both her love of music and the arts into her daily lessons she also collaborates very well with all staff members which in turn helps them to interweave the arts into their lesson designs
5963060 when she was overseeing risk management she saved the county literally millions of dollars in liability and workers compensation programs
5963061 we discovered that it was ok to have a little high brow as long you have a lot of low brow thats entertainment value the one thing you want to avoid is the middle brow because the whole world is frigging middle brow at the moment
5963062 we george are in it for the long run and if this makes us lovers im grateful
5963063 its not worth the risk in this to do something running around and pull it when its not 100 percent and be out four or five weeks
5963064 ill be fine come next thursday this is just more of a precautionary
5963065 i just felt like it really didnt do us any good to have him going if his leg was sore
5963066 trainer don steelman gave him the green light i gave him the red light he wasnt really happy about it
5963067 im shocked and sad but im really happy for the girls who won
5963068 its going to hit me maybe in the morning and im going to sit and cry its a dream come true i have no problem being the underdog thats less pressure on me more pressure on the people who are supposed to win
5963069 ive never had anything like that happen i was totally out of control in the straightaway of the race
5963070 i had to give up sweet iced tea i love sweet iced tea
5963071 but it was putting body fat on me which was slowing me down now i drink water i miss my tea but if itll make us a better team im going to keep drinking that water
5963072 everyone is making sacrifices wed never even thought about before
5963073 weve got to see theres a payoff for all of this work
5963074 almost everything has changed fast for these players but theres got to be a change in the record for them to know its all going to work
5963075 a lot of people could have been hurt from this like my parents and my teammates
5963076 it made me think of how lucky i am that nothing bad happened that night to me or to anyone else drinking and driving do not mix
5963077 one of the things i have learned from this is that if we are going to party
5963078 we need to have someone with us that can help make good choices someone who can say dont do that
5963079 este juego nos motiva porque la ofensiva no hab a estado tan bien
5963080 hemos hecho algunos ajustes para la pr xima etapa y eso se vio un poco hoy

5963086 we were able to answer some questions about who we need to be and establish our personality both offensively and defensively
5963087 im ready to have everybody go to class get adjusted and get acclimated to our weekly schedule
5963088 oh my gosh i have to go i have press in 5 minutes
5963089 one of those message songs that i like to doooo

5963091 the combined businesses are performing well together in the face of a less favourable economic climate and our newspapers remain stable and robust franchises cost management and business restructuring will continue to play a fundamental part in countering advertising decline
5963092 the groups focus is to increase momentum towards a fully fledged content and consumer business generating more revenue from each customer than solely the price of a newspaper or a single advertisement
5963093 hey jason do you know if chikezie is coming out
5963094 participated in manhunts persecution and murder of jews in budapest in 1944
5963095 i determine that mr zentai is eligible for surrender to the republic of hungary and therefore he is remanded in custody
5963096 as the matters still before the court its not appropriate for me to comment at this stage
5963097 the situation is so inhumane how do we bring awareness to what occupation does to the lives of people how do we get folks to to get it this in the year 2008 it should not be allowed for one group of people to lawfully be able to murder maim torture demolish homes confiscate lands among the things we witnessed we sat with the families in sheik jarrah once again how can it be that settlers can come and kick the familes out of their homes and then arrest the owner how can it be that israel can just demolish the al kurd home in front of their eyes and those of the community family then to impose such high taxes that are nearly impossible for anyone to pay it reminds me of the gentrifcation happening in us cities where african americans and the poor are being pushed out of their homes i have so much respect for the ism volunteers and others who are steadfast with the families yes a human shield we saw so much oppression children so defiant after visiting a sibling in prison or daughter not able to see her father for seven years because he lives in gaza and she lives in the west bank this is bullshit
5963098 with the passage of crucial housing legislation last month that created an attractive home buyer tax credit there is a sense that home sales may soon be reaching a turning point
5963099 builders are anticipating the stimulative effects of this legislation and are optimistic that the tax credit will give those buyers whove been sitting on the fence the reason they need to jump back into the market
5963100 while our overall measure of builder confidence remains at a record low at this time it is a good sign that two out of three of the hmis component indexes rose in august and this may be an indication that we are nearing the bottom of the long downswing in new home sales
5963101 our current forecast shows stabilization of sales during the second half of this year followed by solid recovery in 2009 and beyond
5963102 ive looked down the barrel of an m 16 at an enemy of our nation put him in my sights and squeezed the trigger you never have and anyone anyone who thinks ill do any less to our enemies today knows nothing about who i really am
5963103 how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake
5963104 in this byelection you can tell harper how you really feel
5963105 i may write in kannada but the world only knows me through my english translations i am an exceptional case in that i translate my own works into english but indian literature needs good translations and translations are particularly important for plays and poetry
5963106 si ganamos mi medalla tambi n se va para brasil

5963112 wir sind froh dass unser schwung aus dem vierten quartal des vergangenen gesch ftsjahres auch in diesem quartal sp rbar ist was uns in eine gute position f r den rest des gesch ftsjahres bringt
5963113 zus tzlich zu dem starken umsatzwachstum das aus unserem diversifizierten produktportfolio herr hrt freuen wir uns ber den anhaltenden fortschritt bei unseren anstrengungen unsere operativen prozesse besser zu gestalten was durch einen anstieg von 25 prozent beim operativen ertrag belegt wird
5963114 die resonanz auf unsere aktion und die spendenbereitschaft zeigen deutlich dass die menschen hierzulande sehr wohl bereit sind sich f r die benachteiligten regionen der welt in die riemen zu legen
5963115 wenn wir sozialdemokraten in hessen eine minderheitsregierung zustande bringen und diese regierung ordentlich arbeitet dann sehe ich nicht wo der schaden f r die bundespartei sein soll
5963116 so etwas geht schon unter die haut was da getrieben wird ist teilweise wirklich hysterisch
5963117 nicht spurlos an mir vorbei das bereitet mir buchst blich kopfschmerzen
5963118 sozialpolitischer verantwortung heraus politik machen denen ist soziale gerechtigkeit wichtig
5963119 ich bin mir sicher er w rde diese strategische option nicht schn de zur ckweisen aber mir wird st ndig vorgeworfen ich sei machtgierig
5963120 in hessen waren die mehrheiten schon immer knapp ich bin mir des risikos bewusst
5963121 man guckt den leuten auf die stirn nichts ins hirn
5963122 durch das beschleunigte wachstum und die solide gesch ftst tigkeit in allen feldern haben wir im dritten quartal eine starke vorstellung geliefert
5963123 wir sind berzeugt durch unsere weltweite position die breite produkt und dienstleistungspalette und die zunehmenden einsparm glichkeiten die gewinne nennenswert steigern zu k nnen
5963124 das ist besonders beeindruckend angesichts der sorgen dass ein st rkerer dollar das internationale gesch ft negativ beeinflussen k nnte
5963125 unsere anwendungsprogramme funktionieren auf basis der systeme von sap microsoft ibm und oracle
5963126 man wird versuchen aus dem protokoll hinweise auf die k nftige zinspolitik herauszulesen
5963127 wir erwarten dass sich die positive entwicklung des operativen gesch fts auch im zweiten halbjahr fortsetzen wird
5963128 we know that consumers dont want to pull out and set up a second keyboard for a gaming session so we created a device that was perfect for both gaming and regular computer use
5963129 with the switchable key pad gamers will have a fantastic customizable experience whether theyre playing their favorite game or creating microsoft office powerpoint presentations
5963130 ich bin keiner von denen die glauben russland zu isolieren ist die richtige antwort auf russlands vergehen
5963131 die leute erwarteten da es d nn w rde ber probleme wie georgiens territoriale integrit t aber wurde es nicht
5963132 die allianz berdenkt zutiefst die implikationen von russlands aktionen f r die nato russland beziehung
5963133 wir haben festgestellt da wir nicht fortfahren k nnen mit business as usual
5963134 alle diese drohungen regneten auf russland und es stellt sich heraus da es nur leere worte sind
5963135 several of us have been playing with each other for a very long time
5963136 shes got such good ball skills and is very speedy
5963137 but we cant concentrate solely on her their whole team is fantastic were excited about it
5963138 abby was not only one of our best players but she was also a leader and you cant replace that
5963139 but so many people are picking up some of the pieces for us our scoring has become more unpredictable
5963140 we now believe sales to china will be lower than previously expected for the second half of the year and this will have some effect on second half profitability
5963141 we have excellent new technologies that are clearly of significant commercial value and will play a leading role in the continuing market transition to digital inkjet printing
5963142 i therefore remain confident that despite the current uncertainties we have an exciting opportunity that the company and its staff have the ability resources and products with which to succeed
5963143 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter

5963547 kami sediakan bagi hamba hamba ku yang shalih sesuatu yang tak pernah terlihat oleh mata tak pernah terdengar oleh telinga dan tak pernah terlintas oleh hati manusia
5963548 seorang pun tak mengetahui apa yang disembunyikan untuk mereka yaitu
5963549 sesungguhnya jika salah seorang dari kalian meninggal dunia maka kursinya diperlihatkan kepadanya setiap pagi dan petang jika ia penghuni surga maka ia adalah penghuni surga jika ia penghuni neraka maka ia adalah penghuni neraka kemudian dikatakan inilah kursimu hingga allah taala membangkitkanmu pada hari kiamat nanti
5963550 jibril berjalan terus hingga tiba di sidratul muntaha dan ternyata sidratul muntaha ditutup dengan warna yang tidak aku ketahui
5963551 kemudian aku masuk ke dalam surga dan ternyata di dalamnya terdapat kubah dari mutiara dan tanahnya beraroma kesturi
5963552 dan orang orang yang bertaqwa kepada rabbnya dibawa ke dalam surga berombong rombongan
5963553 kesejahteraan dilimpahkan atas kalian berbahagialah kalian maka masukilah surga ini sedang kalian kekal di dalamnya
5963554 yaitu surga aden yang pintu pintunya terbuka bagi mereka di dalamnya mereka bertelekan di atas dipan dipan sambil meminta buah buahan yang banyak dan minuman di surga tersebut
5963555 di surga terdapat delapan pintu ada pintu yang namanya ar rayyan yang hanya dimasuki oleh orang orang yang puasa
5963556 barang siapa yang berinfak dengan sepasang unta atau kuda atau lainnya di jalan allah swt
5963557 siapa di antara kalian yang berwudhu kemudian menyempurnakan wudhunya lalu membaca asyhadu an laa ilaaha illallahu wahdahulaa syarikalahu wa asyhadu anna muhammadan abduhu warasuluhu maka dibukakan baginya pintu pintu surga yang berjumlah delapan dan ia masuk dari mana saja yang ia sukai
5963558 jika seorang muslim mempunyai tiga orang anak yang belum baligh kemudian meninggal dunia maka mereka menjumpainya di pintu pintu surga yang delapan dan ia bebas masuk dari pintu mana saja yang ia sukai
5963559 demi muhammad yang jiwanya ada di tangan nya jarak antara dua daun pintu surga adalah seperti makkah dan hajar atau hajar dan makkah
5963560 kalian adalah penyempurna tujuh puluh umat kalian adalah umat yang terbaik dan termulia di sisi allah jarak di antara dua daun pintu surga adalah empat puluh tahun pada suatu hari ia akan penuh sesak
5963561 pintu yang dimasuki oleh penghuni surga jaraknya adalah sejauh perjalanan pengembara dunia yang ahli tiga kali lipat kemudian penghuni surga memenuhinya hingga pundak mereka nyaris lengkap
5963562 pergilah dan ucapkan salam kepada sekumpulan tersebut mereka adalah para malaikat yang sedang duduk duduk dan mendengarkan salam yang mereka sampaikan kepadamu karena salam tersebut adalah salammu dan salam anak keturunanmu
5963563 maka setiap orang yang masuk ke dalam surga wajahnya seperti wajah adam dan postur tubuhnya adalah enam puluh hasta setelah adam manusia mengecil hingga sekarang
5963564 penghuni surga masuk ke dalam surga dengan rambut pendek belum berjenggot matanya bercelak dan usianya tiga puluh tiga tahun
5963565 jika penghuni surga meninggal dunia baik pada saat kecil atau tua maka mereka dikembalikan dengan usia tiga puluh tahun di surga dan usianya tidak bertambah selama lamanya begitu juga penghuni neraka
5963566 penghuni surga masuk surga dengan ketinggian adam enam puluh hasta dengan ukuran orang besar dengan wajah tampan setampan nabi yusuf seusia nabi isa tiga puluh tiga tahun lidahnya fasih sefasih nabi muhammad belum berjenggot dan berambut pendek
5963567 sesungguhnya derajat penghuni surga yang paling rendah yang berada di tingkat keenam dan ketujuh disediakan baginya tiga ratus pelayan yang setiap pagi dan sore melayaninya dengan memberikan tiga ratus piring yang saya ketahui piring tersebut terbuat dari emas
5963568 setiap piring mempunyai warna tersendiri yang tidak dimiliki oleh piring yang lain ia menikmati dari piring yang pertama hingga piring terakhir pelayan pelayan juga memberikan tiga ratus minuman di mana setiap minuman mempunyai warna tersendiri yang tidak dimiliki oleh tempat minum yang lain ia menikmati tempat minum pertama hingga tempat minum terakhir
5963569 sesungguhnya ia mempunyai istri sebanyak tujuh puluh dua orang yang berasal dari wanita wanita surgawi yang matanya cantik jelita belum temasuk istri istrinya dari wanita dunia
5963570 dan penghuni surga yang paling tinggi atau mulia di sisi allah adalah orang yang melihat wajah allah setiap pagi dan petang
5963571 wajah wajah orang orang mukmin pada saat itu berseri seri kepada rabbnyalah mereka melihat
5963572 saya memang diperintah agar pintu surga ini tidak saya buka sebelum anda terlebih dulu masuk
5963573 jibril datang kepada saya dan memberi informasi tentang pintu surga yang akan dimasuki oleh umatku
5963574 ya rasulullah saw aku ingin bersamamu hingga dapat melihat pintu surga
5963575 engkau wahai abu bakar adalah orang pertama dari umatku yang memasuki surga
5963576 mereka berbaris dalam satu regu wajah mereka memancarkan kepuasan seperti rembulan saat pertama tubuh mereka bersih dari kotoran tidak meludah tidak berdahak dan tidak pula buang air tempat tempat singgahnya terbuat dari emas sisirnya terbuat juga dari emas dan perak tempat apinya adalah kayud keringatnya berupa minyak misyk setiap lelaki memiliki pasangan istri yang kulitnya cemerlang seolah olah sumsumnya tampak dari balik daging mereka tidak pernah berselisih tidak saling membenci sebab mereka sehati bacaannya tiap kali adalah tasbih setiap pagi maupun sore
5963577 pasti masuk surga di antara umatku yang berjumlah tujuh puluh ribu orang tanpa hisab atau tujuh ratus ribu orang mereka saling bergandeng hingga masuk surga semuanya wajah mereka seperti rembulan pada saat pertama
5963578 semua umat diperlihatkan kepadaku kemudian aku lihat ada nabi yang diikuti oleh sekelompok orang pengikutnya
5963579 ini adalah umatmu dan di antara mereka ada tujuh puluh ribu orang yang masuk surga tanpa dihisab dan disiksa setelah itu rasulullah masuk ke dalam rumah
5963580 sementara orang orang sibuk membicarakan siapa sebenarnya mereka yang masuk ke dalam surga tanpa hisab dan tanpa disiksa sebagian mereka berkata
5963581 barangkali mereka adalah yang dilahirkan dalam keadaan islam dan tidak menyekutukan allah dengan sesuatupun
5963582 berdoalah kepada allah agar ia menjadikan aku di antara mereka
5963583 aku tahu orang terakhir yang ke luar dari neraka dan terakhir masuk surga ia ke luar dari neraka sambil merangkak lalu allah berfirman kepadanya
5963584 pergilah dan masuklah ke dalam surga sebab di sana tidak seperti di dunia melainkan sepuluh kali dunia
5963585 apakah engkau ejek aku atau engkau tertawakan aku sedang engkau adalah raja
5963586 apakah engkau masih ingat setiap orang berada di rumahnya sendiri sendiri

5963630 if it can be shown that they capture a significant proportion of the variance in intention or theorys current variables have been taken into account
5963631 almost certain to occur when methodologies suited to particular problem contexts are transferred and adopted for use in problem situations for which they were not designed
5963632 a body charged with the administration for definite purposes of funds contributed in whole or part by persons other than the members of the body owes in my view a duty to those latter persons to conduct that administration in a fairly business like manner with reasonable care skill and caution and with a due and alert regard to the interest of those contributors who are not members of the body towards these latter persons the body stands somewhat in the position of trustees or managers of the property of others

5963635 if you hate america so much why dont you move to cuba
5963636 if we dont kill them over there they will kill us over here
5963637 instead of reading the intelligence reports you should have read our poets
5963638 the germans killed six million jews and barely six years later you made peace with them but with us the jews refuse to make peace
5963639 let me explain the problem science has with jesus christ
5963640 heres one for you lets say theres a sick person over here and you can cure him you can do it would you help him would you try
5963641 but why not say that youd help a sick and maimed person if you could most of us would if we could but god doesnt
5963642 he doesnt does he my brother was a christian who died of cancer even though he prayed to jesus to heal him how is this jesus good hmmm can you answer that one
5963643 thats right god made satan didnt he tell me son is there evil in this world
5963644 evils everywhere isnt it and god did make everything correct
5963645 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
5963646 is there sickness immorality hatred ugliness all these terrible things do they exist in this world
5963647 science says you have five senses you use to identify and observe the world around you have you ever seen jesus
5963648 have you ever felt your jesus tasted your jesus or smelled your jesus have you ever had any sensory perception of jesus christ or god for that matter
5963649 according to the rules of empirical testable demonstrable protocol science says your god doesnt exist what do you say to that son
5963650 you can have lots of heat even more heat super heat mega heat unlimited heat white heat a little heat or no heat but we dont have anything called cold we can hit up to 458 degrees below zero which is no heat but we cant go any further after that there is no such thing as cold otherwise we would be able to go colder than the lowest 458 degrees every body or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 458 f is the total absence of heat you see sir cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat we cannot measure cold heat we can measure in thermal units because heat is energy cold is not the opposite of heat sir just the absence of it
5963651 what about darkness professor is there such a thing as darkness
5963652 youre wrong again sir darkness is not something it is the absence of something you can have low light normal light bright light flashing light but if you have no light constantly you have nothing and its called darkness isnt it thats the meaning we use to define the word in reality darkness isnt if it were you would be able to make darkness darker wouldnt you
5963653 yes professor my point is your philosophical premise is flawed to start with and so your conclusion must also be flawed
5963654 you argue that there is life and then theres death a good god and a bad god you are viewing the concept of god as something finite something we can measure sir science cant even explain a thought it uses electricity and magnetism but has never seen much less fully understood either one to view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing death is not the opposite of life just the absence of it
5963655 now tell me professor do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey
5963656 if you are referring to the natural evolutionary process young man yes of course i do
5963657 have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes sir
5963658 since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on going endeavour are you not teaching your opinion sir are you now not a scientist but a preacher
5963659 to continue the point you were making earlier to the other student let me give you an example of what i mean
5963660 is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the professors brain
5963661 is there anyone here who has ever heard the professors brain felt the professors brain touched or smelled the professors brain no one appears to have done so so according to the established rules of empirical stable demonstrable protocol science says that you have no brain with all due respect sir so if science says you have no brain how can we trust your lectures sir
5963662 now you accept that there is faith and in fact faith exists with life
5963663 of course there is we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
5963664 evil does not exist sir or at least it does not exist unto itself evil is simply the absence of god it is just like darkness and cold a word that man has created to describe the absence of god god did not create evil evil is the result of what happens when man does not have gods love present in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light
5963665 if christianity is valid why is there so much evil in the world
5963666 with so much soap why are there so many dirty people in the world christianity like soap must be personally applied if it is to make a difference in our lives
5963667 well you just have to go out in the street to realize that god doesnt exist tell me if god exists would there be so many sick people would there be abandoned children if god existed there would be neither suffering nor pain i cant imagine a loving god who would allow all of these things
5963668 i am here and i am a barber and i just worked on you
5963669 barbers dont exist because if they did there would be no people with dirty long hair and untrimmed beards like that man outside
5963670 ah but barbers do exist what happens is people do not come to me
5963671 a decision was made for the war to start in august the war would have happened regardless of what the georgians did whether they responded to the provocations or not there would have been an invasion of georgia the goal was to destroy georgias central government defeat the georgian army and prevent georgia from joining nato
5963672 he has been calling angela merkel nicolas sarkozy and rice for months and they have all been telling him to stop worrying that the russians wont do anything and theyve basically been ignoring him
5963673 this was a heavy armoured russian column moving slowly on very rugged terrain in the highest mountain range in europe
5963674 think how many hours of preparation assembly then marching it would take for that column moving at that speed on rugged terrain to be at the kurta bridge at six in the morning if that isnt a premeditated invasion i dont know what is
5963675 tskhinvali doesnt exist its like stalingrad was after the war

5963692 the notion of being a pop star is old weve had david bowie weve had spinal tap its a pastiche we have to start again
5963693 women use their power in different ways some agree to be mens projections some not it can be artistic like when gainsbourg asked jane birkin to be on his album but i choose to express my imagination
5963694 fame is hell in a restaurant if they give me the best table i feel uncomfortable anonymity is the real luxury
5963695 shes an elegant girl shes got the power she married that powerful guy but shes kept the power
5963696 i just kept going of course i was like come on guys pay attention

5963771 als kamerbreed of bijna kamerbreed het idee ontstaat dat dit met de retourtjes voor de reiziger slecht uitpakt dan zie ik het niet gebeuren
5963772 deze chipkaart zou het reisgemak verbeteren en wat we nu zien is dat de techniek de mogelijkheden alleen maar beperkt
5963773 ik kan niet meer anoniem met korting reizen ik ga extra betalen omdat het retourtje verdwijnt en als ik een beetje pech heb word ik nog geplet tussen de poortjes ook
5963774 de vervoerders worden misschien nog beter van deze chipkaart maar de reiziger allang niet meer willen we van de ov chipkaart echt een succes maken dan moet de staatssecretaris er voor zorgen dat de reiziger ook echt beter af is dus altijd gegarandeerd de laagste tarieven
5963775 dit voorstel voldoet niet aan onze belangrijkste eis namelijk dat reizen door de ov chip niet duurder mag worden en dat wordt t nu wel voor een belangrijk deel van de reizigers

5963835 i knew a lot about wood i knew a lot about design i just didnt really know much about surfboards
5963836 the original one looked more like a paddle board this would make more of a surfboard shape
5963837 the thinking was if you werent man enough to carry your board down to the beach then you shouldnt be surfing

5963872 pertanyaannya posisi partai golkar dimana lalu kenapa perolehan suara pemilu lalu 14 persen apa karena konsep dan visi kita tidak sesuai
5963873 kalau dulu caleg dekat kepada ketua umumnya tapi sekarang caleg harus dekat pada rakyat apalagi partai golkar terapkan sistem suara terbanyak

5963883 the power isnt cheap 8 3 to 11 1 cents per kilo watt hour
5963884 reasonable estimate for levelized cost range is 12 to 17 cents per kilowatt hour lifetime and 1 7 times that number 20 to 29 cents per kilowatt hour in first year of commercial operation
5963885 im not convinced well see a new nuclear station before probably the 2020 timeline
5963886 if our cost estimates are even close to being right the cost of a two unit plant will be on the order of magnitude of 13 to 14 billion thats bigger than the total market capitalization of many companies in the u s utility industry and 50 percent or more of the market capitalization of all companies in our industry with the exception of exelon this is a huge bet for any ceo to take to his or her board
5963887 moodys believes the all in cost of a nuclear generating facility could come in at between 5 000 6 000 kw
5963888 consumers expect reasonably priced energy and the companys due diligence process has led to the conclusion that it does not make economic sense to pursue the project at this time
5963889 triples estimates the utility offered little more than a year ago
5963890 the utility said its 200 mile 10 county transmission project will cost 3 billion more
5963891 this was a heavy armoured russian column moving slowly on very rugged terrain in the highest mountain range in europe

5963893 did you know that as the pizza cools the temperature drops in half every ten minutes
5963894 while all peace loving filipinos must condemn the attacks on civilians by milf we must strongly resist the temptation to stereotype all moros as violent or terrorists
5963895 the vast majority of filipino muslims are law abiding citizens who want nothing more than to find decent jobs and education for their children just like all other filipinos
5963896 we must not allow the situation to degenerate into a generalized anti muslim sentiment which is unfair and will ultimately be a death blow to the dream of creating a lasting peace in mindanao
5963897 certainly does not help convince those against the controversial memorandum of agreement on ancestral domain between the government and milf negotiation panels
5963898 to make a strong and unqualified call to end all hostilities between the government and the milf
5963899 now is not the time for blame and finger pointing but for statesmanship on all sides i challenge all our leaders to set aside their own agenda and make an unequivocal call for peace and unity

5963908 while its moving quite freely at the moment its condition would be expected to deteriorate over the next three days
5963909 weve consistently said it was a slim chance that it might link up with its mother or other whales but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5963910 looking at its behavior the way it was nuzzling up to yachts would indicate it was primarily still suckling
5963911 it really was trying to suckle just below the waterline and against the keel with its head engaged against the boat

5963930 i cant help noticing that andrew has decided to elevate this campaigns tone with eleven posts and counting as i write about the possibility that john mccain fabricated and or plagiarized his story about a north vietnamese guard sketching a christmas time cross in the prison camp dirt
5963931 look if andrew thinks the possible cross in the dirt fabrication represents a fruitful line of anti mccain inquiry he has every right to pursue it
5963932 but given my colleagues steady appeals for a more high minded approach to political argument i think he should ponder whether this sort of thing might just possibly be part of the problem rather than part of the solution

5963941 if andrei could have tempered his financial appetite it was quite possible he would be playing at the emirates right now
5963942 all week ive been sitting there watching the others in the team get on and win things i was an emotional wreck watching i wanted so much to be part of the success having to wait for my chance to join that club its been really hard now i know what you have to do to join the club and its great to have achieved it
5963943 ive spent so much time focusing on the process and not the outcome that when the result came in a way i couldnt believe it
5963944 they say in order to improve you have to hit rock bottom and i did that
5963945 i was ready to give up i just put too much pressure on myself but i feel like a completely different athlete now everythings changed
5963946 ive drawn a lot from steve peters the team psychologist hes just given me so much confidence that i can win in the past i used to beat myself up badly about what might happen never take anything for granted never leave anything to chance thats what he taught me
5963947 she watches me through her fingers at the best of times i couldnt bring her out here to suffer
5963948 it would be an honour to compete in 2012 i want to be there
5963949 but only if there arent any younger girls coming through who beat me between now and then never look at the outcome only the process thats the lesson steve peters taught me
5963950 she is world champion and olympic champion im so proud of her
5963951 she had a tough time but she never tested positive i think she should have been re instated
5963952 absolutely you have to be good on this day aug 19 10pm it didnt work out for me

5963954 the nature of the playing field was never strictly defined the only boundaries were the two goalposts at either end of the playing area and these could be anywhere from 100 feet to five miles apart as was the case in one game in the 19
5963955 the rules like the layout of the playing field were ambiguous and limited to only three or four stipulations
5963956 while players could tackle block or use any reasonable method to interfere with the other teams movement of the ball there were implicit limits to acceptable violence
5963957 before debut i used to dance as back dancers for cool in clubs
5963958 i should put all these behind me but i was dancing behind cool as backdancers before debut
5963959 back then in 1996 i took up many part time jobs here and there to earn money and i went to jeju island with my friends and over there we got the part time job to be cool s backdancer which gives us an allowance of 40 000 won for working a week even though i couldnt dance back then i was taught to memorise all the dance steps which i did spending all the late nights memorising them
5963960 i practised very hard for the destiny dance and when cool finally came to jeju island and jae hoon hyung saw us dance he gave me and my friend thumbs up saying that it was good
5963961 im sorry sharon that was a really stupid statement to make and i know it was an unfair generalization

5964066 my vice president will be a member of the executive branch he wont be one of these fourth branches of government where he thinks hes above the law

5964076 its time we look at the issue afresh and see whether there are better solutions than we currently have in place because after all we havent solved the problem
5964077 there are many many first time drinkers in the first few months of college
5964078 what we have done is be very honest about this as an institution and trained staff to deal with it
5964079 now students start to experiment when they are no longer under their parents supervision
5964080 and that encourages them to drink in ways that are less safe for them
5964081 it might make the drinking more visible but i dont know if it would make it easier to monitor and control
5964082 the legislative leaders understand we will not support a tax increase
5964083 i dont think the governor understands that it is so frustrating to sit through these meetings in his office how many times can we say no to taxes

5964117 i said it to you because i knew youd write it tongue in cheek
5964118 but as ive said a lot of people dont get your humor they take something you write and make it more serious and bigger than it really is

5964141 yup i know its moronic but he is the boss
5964142 so you think i should talk to him about canceling the carpet
5964143 it is not a problem related to ethnicity or religion
5964144 we can see from examples of closures of several mosques over the recent years very strict control over religion and also arrests of activists as well as people accused of violent offenses
5964145 usually if a uighur gets in trouble the police come and detain everyone in his family then they lose their jobs and have trouble getting new ones
5964146 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not at all respected by chinese officials inside tibet
5964147 there are restrictions on the circulation of information a very strong censorship and often civilians are arrested and tortured very violently to the point where they die

5964178 one of the neighbors was amused because dean went to their house and didnt ask for a cup of sugar he asked the woman for a crane to put the flagpole in
5964179 this is such a great tribute to the men and women who continue to serve their country and town
5964180 the selectmen are just so grateful to those who donated their time and labor to see this project through
5964181 how can you look these people in the eye and say they dont count

5964187 this is not bakersfield this is not redding and this is not death valley
5964188 this is sacramento were right here at the mouth of the delta and every summer we cool off
5964189 its not uncommon for us to get temperatures in the low 80s even 70s in the summer it happens every year but people get surprised
5964190 usually people always complain that its always hot people only remember the hot days not the cool days
5964191 they complain that its always too hot at the state fair
5964192 when it gets to be over 100 degrees the reality is that people dont want to be outside and blacktop makes it more intense
5964193 we can actually take temperatures in the 90s and see a slight difference in the size of crowds but once it gets above 100 it is just a mental thing with people the perception is that there is nowhere they can go to escape the heat that is not really the case
5964194 weather like this is ideal its going to be great
5964195 it got downright cool out here last night i was walking around with a short sleeved shirt and wished i brought a jacket
5964196 one hundred and over is not good because people dont go out when it is that hot from 2 p m to 7 p m
5964197 id say 85 to 90 is probably the best we had a great lunch hour warm enough to want an ice cream but not so hot they wont leave their air conditioning
5964198 that means weve got nothing but good days to look forward to

5964206 tim is off on a search to rescue the princess she has been snatched by a horrible and evil monster this happened because tim made a mistake
5964207 not just one he made many mistakes during the time they spent together all those years ago memories of their relationship have become muddled replaced wholesale but one remains clear the princess turning sharply away her braid lashing at him with contempt
5964208 he knows she tried to be forgiving but who can just shrug away a guilty lie a stab in the back such a mistake will change a relationship irreversibly even if we have learned from the mistake and would never repeat it the princesss eyes grew narrower she became more distant
5964209 our world with its rules of causality has trained us to be miserly with forgiveness by forgiving them too readily we can be badly hurt but if weve learned from a mistake and became better for it shouldnt we be rewarded for the learning rather than punished for the mistake
5964210 what if our world worked differently suppose we could tell her i didnt mean what i just said and she would say its okay i understand and she would not turn away and life would really proceed as though we had never said that thing we could remove the damage but still be wiser for the experience

5964477 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
5964478 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
5964479 to date what had been announced publicly doesnt appear in reality to be happening and a number of questions are being asked
5964480 the ioc is keen to see those questions answered by the relevant authorities
5964481 the games have not helped they have actually slowed down work that was progressing and increased abuses

5964485 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
5964486 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
5964487 when you talk to local school officials they point to the fact that its quick and its effective and thats true
5964488 it doesnt take much time to administer corporal punishment and you dont have to hire someone to run a detention or an after school program
5964489 we need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong
5964490 teachers may have overcrowded classrooms and lack resources such as counselors to assist with particularly disruptive students or classroom dynamics
5964491 corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels and i do not recommend its application
5964492 it can be useful for elementary students especially with amateur clowns as opposed to hard core troublemakers for this reason i am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word were now down to a precious few lets not go any further in that direction
5964493 most parents like this because it takes care of the punishment it gets the kids back in class it doesnt disrupt instruction its like the quick and dirty way of dealing with discipline problems
5964494 it works on some and it doesnt work on others
5964495 if youre one of the individuals that it does work on yes it will become a deterrent
5964496 i dont think its the schools place to make decisions like that
5964497 im not necessarily in favor of that kind of punishment in the house either but i feel like if somebody makes that decision it should be the parent
5964498 we just believe that its time for us to look at other options for our kids as opposed to corporal punishment
5964499 we think theres more effective ways most of our principals have chosen not to use it even though its been in the book were trying to create some consistency
5964500 would you be if i ran a 9 6 shutting down i wouldnt be nervous either
5964501 i like to enjoy what i do you cant be too serious
5964502 it can be done it has been done and it will continue to happen

5964504 this 150th world rally championship victory obtained here in germany is a magnificent tribute to pirellis enduring involvement in road racing which has spanned several decades
5964505 since 1973 we have been supplying tyres and winning rallies all over the world with a huge variety of different cars and conditions
5964506 these wins have come both thanks to great champions and also lesser known drivers but it is a real pleasure to see this landmark victory taken by who is obviously already one of the greatest rally drivers of all time
5964507 on the purely technical side im pleased to see that weve maintained and sometimes surpassed the pace of previous rallies held here in germany
5964508 back then we were constantly developing the tyres and using anti deflation mousse a situation that is very different to the one we have now under the new control tyre rules
5964509 it was a pity that we had the problem on the second day as without it i think we could have finished comfortably in the points maybe even in third which would have been a great result given our level of experience
5964510 still these things can happen in rallying and it is all part of the learning experience
5964511 on the final day we just concentrated on trying to get safely to the finish and not making any more mistakes
5964512 the car was great throughout the rally giving us no problems at all and we enjoyed a lot of local support it was fantastic to see so many people out on the rallye deutschland this year and i hope we gave them a good show
5964513 the most important thing for me is that i had plenty of time in the car and i was able to learn many things that will be useful for the next jwrc rounds on asphalt in spain and corsica
5964514 the plan for the rest of the season is quite clear
5964515 we want to be first in new zealand and try to win all the rallies that are coming maybe even be first and second like here we want to win the manufacturers championship
5964516 a fortnight ago in finland we were the outsiders but we managed to come out on top
5964517 sebastien and daniel elena produced an impeccable run while dani and marc marti put in a solid performance to claim second overall and bring us more valuable points
5964518 if you are a good programmer for this xyz technology which world city are you better off in
5964519 we have discovered new information revealing that todd bentley has entered into an unhealthy relationship on an emotional level with a female member of his staff
5964520 i have in my hands the 13th testimony as a result of this outpouring of somebody raised from the dead
5964521 im saying to the media the dead are being raised are you ready to hear the 13th story now many of them weve been following up we still havent had a chance to verify this i can read it to you as i received it

5964525 over the years every time there is a major election we have had people attempt to put up a listing we catch them very quickly
5964526 when we see these listings we definitely take them down
5964527 its possible that someone would put a listing up its possible to be up for a couple of hours before we catch it its possible that for a brief period of time something might actually be visible on the site
5964528 we are very clear if you engage in illegal activity on our site we absolutely will share information with law enforcement we provide testimony in court
5964529 and what this person was proposing was probably not so feasible unrealistic
5964530 i dont think it will happen more and more as the elections are approaching
5964531 its not anything thats widespread or cause for concern in any way
5964532 people are just looking for an audience they are really using that listing as an opportunity to put their opinion on there
5964533 we have had instances that would be similar in nature where we have sports fan who are really unhappy with the performance of their favorite team and they may try to list the coach for sale as a way to express their unhappiness with the performance of their team
5964534 if you look at some of the starting prices the stores would never ever really charge that
5964535 if youre looking for value a 7 99 california appellation may be expensive
5964536 if its a napa appellation it could be a pretty good deal
5964537 for them its not a marketing choice its a winemaking choice they feel they get better wine sourcing from around the state
5964538 but those are still good guidelines just as long as you know theyre not foolproof
5964539 we know that consumers dont want to pull out and set up a second keyboard for a gaming session so we created a device that was perfect for both gaming and regular computer use
5964540 with the switchable key pad gamers will have a fantastic customizable experience whether theyre playing their favorite game or creating microsoft office powerpoint presentations
5964541 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5964542 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5964543 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5964544 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
5964545 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
5964546 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
5964547 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
5964548 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5964549 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5964550 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened
5964551 when i read the initial claims about david they just didnt ring true that a simple country bloke who had a decent family should become a supporter of terrorism
5964552 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5964553 its still a great model for certain types of sales
5964554 the music was way more grounded than it is today today you dont feel the movement back then you felt the movement
5964555 i mean the whole hip hop movement like when wu tang clan came in it was like regardless of where we went people knew who we were
5964556 or if we were in a new city there was one person who knew who we was and that would spread to ten more people and so on and so forth up until it was oh you aint up on that wu tang stuff
5964557 same thing with cash money no limit death row it goes on and on all these movements you dont have that anymore

5964576 whites in the united states will no longer be a majority of the population by 2042 nearly a decade earlier than previous projections according to us census bureau figures released thursday while 65 percent of the us population is projected to be white in 2010 those numbers will start to decline around the 2030s as white deaths outpace births according to the figures the figures show that in 2042 whites will be outnumbered by americans who call themselves hispanic black asian american indian native hawaiian and pacific islander previous projections said this would happen by 2050

5964579 i believe if princess wencheng and her tibetan husband king songtsen gampo knew about the march events they would blame the rioters
5964580 i want to show that china is a big family that needs to have peace and harmony and oppose war
5964581 the chinese want to show the world that their version is the truth
5964582 they always say china has sovereignty over tibet as shown by the princess story they also want to show that minorities are part of a big happy family all loyal to beijing
5964583 if there are provocations they will come from the government not from the civilian population
5964584 the acts of violence are committed by instigators against democracy
5964585 these businessmen should pay their workers better for the exploitation they suffer

5964613 i just walked right on past him to the bedroom and got my gun

5964615 i just hope i broke up the burglary ring because they have been hitting a lot of places around here
5964616 the us is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5964617 we expect the remainder of project financing to be achieved through a combination of debt likely through a syndicate led by bayerische hypo und verinsbank hvb and equity we model us 60 million in debt financing and 60 million in equity financing at an issuance price of 3 05 per share
5964618 this is due to a combination of extremely high oil prices which represent the majority of the sites costs and lower nickel prices
5964619 the suspension will also enable the acceleration of feasibility studies into the energy conversion project to switch the operations power source from oil to coal and the development of the loma miranda project which will provide a new higher grade mining area for falcondo and extend the mine life
5964620 the resumption of activities will be assessed based on market conditions which are expected to improve towards the end of 2008
5964621 at current prices even this production volume is not profitable
5964622 did you play on a bunch of blue note releases
5964623 then what the fuck are you talking about you should have known these notes were not about you
5964624 i know that part of what makes a lot of my tunes interesting for me is the polyrhythms in the loops
5964625 they keep changing and that gives it a psychedelic feeling the main groove is still four on the floor but the hooks are moving around on top of that four
5964626 i suppose the vinyl noise off the samples has something to do with it

5964920 i was born here and i will die here too
5964921 i cant get it what do you want i cant get anything
5964922 there was civilian population there they were also bombed they will have no place to live
5964923 wed better burn it down so that they would never return
5964924 these people are from georgian enclaves they were unable to get to georgia or they simply didnt want to
5964925 why are they here in this room with barbed wire
5964926 god knows more than us he doesnt always answer our prayers as we want him to
5964927 we dont have a very effective and efficient public transport system in brisbane
5964928 we need to actually be opening our mind to the possibility of underground or partial underground inner city rail networks
5964929 it would be an idea to look at woolloongabba as an underground junction station and run a line to st
5964930 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5964931 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5964932 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5964933 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
5964934 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
5964935 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
5964936 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
5964937 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5964938 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5964939 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened

5964949 this is part of the tough tactics used to intimidate and silence protesters
5964950 of course its of concern that china will use a system thats clearly beyond the pale in terms of international standards in terms of arbitrary deprivation of freedoms and liberties to do that

5964952 pulp horror reinvention of the classic sega light gun shooter franchise
5964953 jam packed with arcade style shooting over the top gore and a whole lot of zombies
5964954 distinctive graphics sound and attitude that will add to its horror status
5964955 we wanted to do something really different with the house of the dead overkill
5964956 with sega weve been able to create a fresh look for the franchise i think youll agree its like nothing youve seen before on wii
5964957 paying homage to the pulp horror comics and films that inspired generations of gore fans the house of the dead overkill will expose gamers to a brand new fleshy rollercoaster ride of revolting dismemberment
5964958 this is the hardcore wii title youve been waiting for
5964959 i always speak with my staff and ask different questions
5964960 i had a chat with stuart pearce and ray clemence because i prefer to see both sides of everything
5964961 i could only choose once i knew all the players so it was very important to let people try
5964962 one player might be good another might be not so good i had to look for myself
5964963 you hear little whispers and given the form rio has been in and what manchester united have achieved i did think he would get it
5964964 it was a bit nerve wracking and i was actually standing next to rio when fabio told us all after training
5964965 the first thing he did was turn to me and shake my hand that is a measure of the kind of guy he is
5964966 he is an unbelievable player and provides the sort of an example we can all learn from that

5964978 am i in the place of god who has withheld from you the fruit of the womb
5964979 here is my maid bilhah go in to her that she may bear on my knees that through her i too may have children
5964980 god has vindicated me and has indeed heard my voice and has given me a son
5964981 with mighty wrestlings i have wrestled with my sister and i have indeed prevailed
5964982 is it a small matter for you to take my husband and would you take my sons mandrakes also
5964983 therefore he may lie with you tonight in return for your sons mandrakes
5964984 you must come in to me for i have surely hired you with my sons mandrakes
5964985 god has given me my wages because i gave my maid to my husband
5964986 god has endowed me with a good gift now my husband will dwell with me because i have borne him six sons
5964987 send me away that i may go to my own place and to my own country me my wives and my children for whom i have served you and let me depart for you yourself know my service which i have rendered you
5964988 you yourself know how i have served you and how your cattle have fared with me
5964989 for you had little before i came and it has increased to a multitude and the lord has blessed you wherever i turned but now when shall i provide for my own household also
5964990 you shall not give me anything if you will do this
5964991 so my honesty will answer for me later when you come concerning my wages every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and black among the lambs if found with me will be considered stolen

5964994 kalau dalam waktu 24 jam ada 50 orang berdoa buat kesembuhanmu maka kau akan hidup dan sebaliknya jika dalam 24 jam jumlah yang aku tetapkan belum terpenuhi itu artinya kau akan meninggal dunia
5964995 apakah besok pagi aku sudah pulih pastilah banyak yang berdoa buat aku jumlah karyawan yang aku punya lebih dari 2000 orang jadi kalau hanya mencari 50 orang yang berdoa pasti bukan persoalan yang sulit
5964996 anakku aku sudah berkeliling mencari suara hati yang berdoa buatmu tapi sampai saat ini baru 3 orang yang berdoa buatmu sementara waktumu tinggal 60 menit lagi rasanya mustahil kalau dalam waktu dekat ini ada 50 orang yang berdoa buat kesembuhanmu
5964997 aku akan memberitahukanmu kenapa tuhan rindu memberikanmu kesempatan kedua itu karena doa istrimu yang tidak putus putus berharap akan kesembuhanmu
5964998 tuhan aku tahu kalau selama hidupnya suamiku bukanlah suami atau ayah yang baik aku tahu dia sudah mengkhianati pernikahan kami aku tahu dia tidak jujur dalam bisnisnya dan kalaupun dia memberikan sumbangan itu hanya untuk popularitas saja untuk menutupi perbuatannya yang tidak benar dihadapanmu tapi tuhan tolong pandang anak anak yang telah engkau titipkan pada kami mereka masih membutuhkan seorang ayah hamba tidak mampu membesarkan mereka seorang diri
5964999 ada beberapa yang berdoa buatmu tapi mereka tidak tulus bahkan ada yang mensyukuri penyakit yang kau derita saat ini itu semua karena selama ini kamu arogan egois dan bukanlah atasan yang baik bahkan kau tega memecat karyawan yang tidak bersalah
5965000 benar anakku kau pernah memberi bantuan bagi mereka beberapa bulan yang lalu walau aku tahu tujuanmu saat itu hanya untuk mencari popularitas saja dan untuk menarik perhatian pemerintah dan investor luar negeri

5965002 particularly during the sars epidemic xinhua has for last few months been putting out news reports embarrassing to the government but they are designed to fool the international community since they are not published in chinese
5965003 leaders told us that if liu xiang could not win the gold medal in beijing all of his achievements before will be meaningless
5965004 he never had any injuries before he hurt his foot in june
5965005 but that injury was not too bad after the birds nest was finished he trained in the stadium in july and hurt his foot again
5965006 liu xiang has no freedom in china he is respected and loved but he leads a really boring life and cannot go out much
5965007 he feels more relaxed when he races outside china it would be better if he was in an environment that is more like a foreign country with less attention
5965008 he is the only competitive athlete in chinas track and field team so he has been under constant pressure including from the high hopes of government officials
5965009 liu xiang has the ability to attend the competition if he has to quit it should have been announced beforehand they should not wait until the competition had started this is not liu xiangs fault he indeed has injuries but everything can be announced earlier
5965010 why was there no announcement and instead there was so much promotional effort to hype it up did they do this to sell more tickets
5965011 liu xiangs withdrawal will definitely negatively impact the profit and operation of the sponsor companies since the pricing of liu xiangs advertisement is at least 10 million yuan and considering that many companies use liu in the advertisement i personally think the loss of liu this time will be over 100 million yuan while for those sponsors the losses will be over 3 billion yuan

5965029 that is not true she wrote about it on her blog and cleared up all the rumors that were said she said that she was spending time with reggie during training camp and they were running up and down the hills at the dunes and she was struuuugling since reggie and the boys are in a lot better shape than she is and he stopped to turn around to give her support to keep pushing her along and to keep up with the team in no way shape or form did he want her to work out with him because he thought she needed to lose weight

5965035 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5965036 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5965037 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5965038 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5965039 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5965040 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5965041 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5965042 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5965043 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5965044 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5965045 if youre eighteen and old enough to join the army and vote you should be able to choose if you want to drink or not
5965046 its a noble thing to try to improve yourself but my view of you is that youre quite remarkable already so while i think trying to improve yourself is just fine thinking youre not okay isnt

5965067 jokes have varied over the years with some taking the question and answer format while others are witty proverbs or riddles
5965068 what they all share however is a willingness to deal with taboos and a degree of rebellion modern puns essex girl jokes and toilet humor can all be traced back to the very earliest jokes identified in this research

5965076 we do take offs on old time radio programs we do soap operas the lone ranger crazy interviews
5965077 i loved it i learned how to write from doing this
5965078 i learned how to write scripts by taking notes while listening to shows like jack benny bob hope burns amp allen red skelton etc
5965079 i would learn the structure of jokes and learn how to switch jokes around change the punchlines make different jokes out of the same premise i did all the characters i did all the voices
5965080 i would watch something on tv and i would try to imitate it
5965081 i was testing pilot films in front of an audience
5965082 then i got involved with writing a comic strip and from that my agent sent me to gold key comics
5965083 i started as feature editor and within a year they made me editor in chief
5965084 every month it was like putting together my own show
5965085 i found those 11 spiral notebooks that i had written in pencil of all the jokes from the radio shows
5965086 this is a treasure i have here this is a history of that time in comedy
5965087 i found that i had a talent for it and i just made up my mind at a very young age thats what i wanted to do
5965088 you have a mindset that just finds comedy in everything
5965089 im constantly turning things around and seeing the humor in them its the way my mind works now i cant turn it off
5965090 look youve lived a good life we do things a little differently than what youd expect im going to let you choose where youd like to spend eternity hear me out spend a day or two in heaven and in hell and then decide for yourself
5965091 i cant believe im saying this but i choose to live the eternities in hell

5965097 the whole issue of political correctness has gone too far when it comes to the criteria for determining an offensive comment
5965098 if anybody is offended then its offensive the criteria has become much too personalized it only takes one person being slightly upset at something for it to become offensive
5965099 now more than ever we are really focused on creating a fun atmosphere for employees and encouraging them to build each other up in a tough economy

5965102 at first this morning he said he wanted to go to singapore then he changed his mind he is still in the transit area
5965103 he is banned from entering because he was jailed and he could pose a threat to domestic morality he is a transit passenger and it is the responsibility of the airline to take him to his final destination
5965104 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5965105 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5965106 i want gary glitter to be controlled whilst hes here and i dont want him to be able to go anywhere else in the world in order to abuse children

5965160 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports

5965849 cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
5965850 shes a remarkable figure in the history of the world not just the middle east
5965851 she was instrumental in the formation of islam as an early religion she was an adviser to muhammad at a young age she was a political adviser to the successors of muhammad and led troops in the first islamic civil war
5965852 denise says it is declaration of war explosive stuff a national security issue she thinks there is a very real possibility of major danger for the buildings and staff and widespread violence thinks it will be far more controversial than the satanic verses and the danish cartoons thinks the book should be withdrawn asap
5965853 muhammad was so gentle i hardly felt the scorpions sting to be in his arms skin to skin was the bliss i had longed for all my life
5965854 what i got back was a collective shrug of the shoulders
5965855 the thing that is surreal for me is that here you had a non muslim write a book and you had a non muslim complain about it and a non muslim publisher pull the book
5965856 i am very disappointed to hear that my publishers random house have canceled another authors novel apparently because of their concerns about possible islamic reprisals this is censorship by fear and it sets a very bad precedent indeed
5965857 my book is not there id get tears in my eyes
5965858 for me this book felt almost like giving birth and losing the baby

5965867 whats the secret behind getting to the top of the charts
5965868 whats it like to be one of the best bands on the planet
5965869 when it started it was jeremiah was a profit but no one really liked that or the song
5965870 it is doing well but the need for the areas of housing affordable medical services drug education and prevention and others outstrip the resources available to meet these needs more completely those who are working on these are doing a good job but the need is great
5965871 the human service element has been tailored to meet most demands of an affluent population conflict occurs when the wants of the wealthy vs the needs of the low income populations conflict
5965872 there appears to be mutual support coordination and communication between agencies this is something i have not experienced in other communities
5965873 many in the bainbridge community are indifferent because of their economic comfort
5965874 affordable housing is such a difficult issue for our community i am not sure if it is an issue that people are really willing to support with their tax dollars in the same way they support schools parks city services libraries etc
5965875 identify sleeping poverty bainbridge has many children and adults that are living on the edge but are too proud to access services it has to be ok to ask
5965876 how do you put some teeth in a law without making people criminals
5965877 there is a peaceful solution called a peace revolution now lets take back america
5965878 theres a war and were in it but i know we can win it so lets take back america lets take back america
5965879 its a good song its not really a rock song like the ones that i like but its a good song
5965880 if an alert and intelligent 8 year old boy can get it then i can have hope not only for our country but also the world
5965881 i dont think any of us want to see bainbridge turn into leavenworth or disneyland
5965882 but we have no real strategy what values should our tourism materials represent do we want to encourage green vacations or bird watching groups
5965883 how can bainbridge encourage a form of tourism that supports our community values
5965884 in the san juans they like to feature their shorelines their stewardship of the land their preservation of their grape and wine industry their goal is to attract people that can appreciate the environmental beauty of the destination and not just to buy a t shirt or two
5965885 we decided to form a group because all of us represent different businesses and interests that benefit from tourism
5965886 there are many different kinds of tourism and we are interested in tourism we can use as an economic driver to stimulate our community
5965887 people ask what kind of capital facility can you afford with 50 000 roughly half the annual lodging tax fund a year
5965888 off the top of my head i would say a water taxi that would enable people to step aboard on waterfront park and ride across the harbor to pritchard park which will soon have exhibits regarding the japanese internment it would be a lovely feature and it wouldnt congest our roads
5965889 a gift of a good pastor is to get to know people fast
5965890 a lot of that was very technical like teaching greek
5965891 but there came a time when i began to feel that it was very divorced from life the real life and death issues that people felt every day
5965892 i believe that god is merciful and just and compassionate and loving and full of grace
5965893 here i think the role of the pastor is more of providing a vision for the church i see that as my role and calling
5965894 then its obsolete period if it cant meet them in the relevance of their everyday lives
5965895 my soul is restless until it finds rest in thee o lord that is just as relevant as it was 1 600 years ago
5965896 it became bracingly clear to me how much better it is to prevent disease than to have to deal with it
5965897 i was a balanced kid until i started playing guitar
5965898 this is how i get my fix anymore music is 24 7 for me
5965899 to me success is relative too its not like theres this certain place
5965900 to me just being happy is a big part of being successful
5965901 i think nancy wilson said its like having sex with everyone in the crowd and i can understand that not in a physical sense but you can feel that energy between you and the crowd
5965902 its kind of come full circle the stuff that im into now is the stuff that i grew up on
5965903 im more obsessed now than when i first started i think im more inspired too
5965904 by collecting your attention with these humorous aspects as well as these down home sort of things he uses this observation and sense of humor to bring us to a place where we can look at how to face the big events in our life and how we justify realize sympathize and embrace the important things that move us forward
5965905 what do you think of this i think youd be really good for this
5965906 should i take it down should i take it up
5965907 ruim tirar o brasil do p dio mas eu tamb m sou brasileiro e vou levar a medalha para a minha casa no brasil

5965910 quem brasileiro vai me entender as pessoas sabem da dificuldade que batalhar a vida no esporte para sobreviver e a ge rgia me deu a oportunidade de viver atrav s do esporte
5965911 i hate when youve had on a bra all day long and you just cant wait to take it off every woman has experienced that
5965912 a lot of lingerie tends to leave those marks and be uncomfortable this line is about detail fit and comfort as well as beauty and making women feel sexy
5965913 in order for me to do something i have to be very passionate about it or i wont give it my all
5965914 its 3 a m janets in paris and im in australia and were on the phone talking about the line
5965915 i eat lunch at the same time every day so wed do a lot of work during my lunch time when bruno would come down to rehearsals
5965916 its something for every woman and i truly do mean that it makes you feel sexy
5965917 we estimate that more than 60 percent of airasia x passengers to melbourne will be first time visitors allowing airasia x the opportunity to open up new market segments from malaysia with its low fares
5965918 the daily peak season service during christmas would offer malaysian and australian travelers attractive low fares at a time when other airlines typically gouge passengers with super high airfares because demand outstrips capacity
5965919 the move will better protect the interests of the olympic gold medalists
5965920 were advised to give it to the medalist as a gift
5965921 same known devils of higher inflation interest rates and pressure on margins international markets are volatile and there is no silver lining here that can take the markets further
5965922 its been almost a month since the government won the trust vote and we havent heard any announcement of major reforms which is a big disappointment for foreign investors

5965933 my best moment i have a lot of good moments but the one i prefer is when i kicked the hooligan
5965934 i didnt study i live you cant study these things life teaches them to you you dont find them in a book ive read a lot of socrates on page 3 of the sun

5965939 je tenais vous dire que le travail que vous faites ici il est indispensable parce quici se joue une partie de la libert du monde ici se m ne le combat contre le terrorisme nous sommes ici non pas contre les afghans mais avec les afghans pour ne pas les laisser seuls face la barbarie
5965940 je nai pas de doute il faut tre l moi aussi j tais sous le choc mais je vous dis en conscience que si c tait refaire je le referais
5965941 les envoyer en afghanistan avec 1 an dexp rience c tait les envoyer au casse pipe
5965942 la drh imagine que le militant politique va mettre le feu lusine
5965943 countries like england wales argentina and many others have all spent time after games submitting very mature reports
5965944 that is very valuable to us however i have yet to hear from the south africans all season there is a medium to go through and that is me but i have no sympathy for a coach that wants to go through the media rather than me
5965945 i will be meeting peter later in the month and if he has any grievances he will have a chance to bring them to me
5965946 with the ball not going out as much and ball in play time increased fatigue usually sets in
5965947 thats why weve realised its a 22 man game and everyone will have a role to play we have a 28 man squad over here and everyone will be important to the cause
5965948 i think the elvs are better for the game as there are less stoppages which speeds play up with all the free kicks it keeps the game going and it may seem as though it is becoming similar to league but that isnt so rugby is a lot different and has unique aspects such as the ruck maul lineouts and scrums which make it so
5965949 initially in the super 14 we may have had an advantage but everyone has caught up now and theres no real difference to any ones knowledge and experience now
5965950 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view
5965951 well uh i uh ah think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective uh answering that question with specificity uh you know is is uh let that percolate a moment
5965952 every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
5965953 i think well see consistency becoming crucial towards the end of the season
5965954 that made it really clear to us all how important it is to finish races and pick up good points
5965955 so much as i want to win in valencia i know the most important thing is to score well because the big picture is the championship and not just once race
5965956 you get used to street circuits being quite slow with lots of slow to medium speed corners and very short straights but this is almost the opposite
5965957 there are a lot of fast kinks and esses a couple of decent straights and lots of high speed stuff
5965958 its too early to say whether there will be opportunities to overtake around here but there are a couple of hairpins where it might be possible
5965959 people who live on earth their souls is tied up by gravity you understand
5965960 i sympathize with this idea maybe in the future people should live in the space
5965961 i imagined that i was driving in the playstation game ridge racer

5965969 i know you are great computer gamer so here you go
5965970 everybody knows you can go to space if you are a perfect physical specimen and incredibly smart
5965971 that term implies you are there to take photos and hang out
5965972 im trying to prove you can actually be a valuable contributor to the activities on board the space station
5965973 id be misleading you if i didnt admit that its a very selfish activity
5965974 there are a million ways i can screw up and kill everyone
5965975 the beijing games look set to become the biggest broadcasted event in olympic history
5965976 that had an audience of 40 million in the united states
5965977 in china alone more than 102 million people watched the games live on line
5965978 this is because now there are many more media platforms available
5965979 i didnt really have any tactics i was playing it by ear
5965980 its what she does everyone has their own tactics it doesnt bother me
5965981 we were hoping we were far enough ahead to stop her coming back but she did
5965982 i think she was surprised we definitely had her worried
5965983 we get it off their balance sheet and we take on the management duties
5965984 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the u k where we can do that
5965985 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
5965986 little mistakes cost you big time thats bmx for you
5965987 anything can happen and thats why its cool to watch
5965988 its a new discipline a fun discipline like snowboarding motocross hopefully the sport will grow with popularity
5965989 being a fast intense spectator sport it suits young peoples expectations
5965990 of course military and technical cooperation is the main issue weapons purchases are very important
5965991 i think we should speed it up moreover the west and israel continue to put pressure on russia
5965992 i think that in russia and in the world everyone is now aware of israels role and its military consultants in the georgian crisis
5965993 and if before in russia there were people who thought these forces can be friendly then now i think no one thinks that way
5965994 this storm is going to be with us for a while
5965995 a gradual turn toward the north is expected during the next 12 to 24 hours

5966017 the current lake lewisville bridge is supposed to be a major connection too often its a source of major irritation this can and must change and it needs to do so sooner rather than later
5966018 if adding lanes on the bridge and building a frontage road is as good a project as local sponsors say it will be easier to fund under our proposal than under the current broken federal system under our new approach dallas fort worth will have more flexibility to put their transportation dollars toward projects that benefit commuters and communities congressman burgess and i agree that projects that improve commutes give taxpayers a good deal and cut congestion should get funding
5966019 we are pleased to have congressman burgess and deputy secretary barrett here today to highlight a key congestion relief project we are working on in the dfw area as they have shown by their recent actions both congressman burgess and the secretary are keenly aware of the need for giving states and regions flexibility in making key transportation decisions that directly impact the citizens they serve
5966020 this interstate corridor has been and will continue to be a main artery for this regions growth and quality of life keeping it healthy and moving must be a priority and if that means fast tracking or innovative financing thats exactly what we need to do
5966021 we want to take advantage of our geographic position at the fulcrum of the great lakes shipping lanes
5966022 the congestion at other ports along the east and west coasts gives us an opportunity here in the nations heartland to create many new good paying jobs as a manufacturing and agricultural center and also as a distribution hub
5966023 waterborne transportation is a very efficient way to transport grain and manufactured goods especially with rising fuel prices
5966024 many illinois residents who usually are not required to file taxes especially seniors are missing out on a stimulus check that will be helpful in these times of rising food and gas prices
5966025 sixty nine percent of the unclaimed stimulus checks in illinois are made up of seniors 65 and older it is imperative that we reach out to seniors and veterans in our community and lend a hand in obtaining this much needed assistance

5966027 wang xiuying is almost blind and crippled what sort of reeducation through labor can she serve
5966028 but they can also be taken away at any time
5966029 this is part of the tough tactics used to intimidate and silence protesters
5966030 of course its of concern that china will use a system thats clearly beyond the pale in terms of international standards in terms of arbitrary deprivation of freedoms and liberties to do that
5966031 we have no records of these two names in our system
5966032 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5966033 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5966034 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5966035 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
5966036 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
5966037 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
5966038 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
5966039 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5966040 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5966041 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened
5966042 they have the potential to attract a large number of students and can complement one another to use resources wisely
5966043 well offer them again in the fall and look and see how popular they are and see what the demand is for other degrees
5966044 were constrained geographically on campus and we want to meet the enrollment goals imposed by the unc system
5966045 but this is an area thats really in need of higher learning it really needs more bachelor level programs our full time daytime program is an effort to reach out to a different audience
5966046 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5966047 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5966048 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5966049 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5966050 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5966051 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5966052 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5966053 yeah ill face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been
5966054 it is not a problem related to ethnicity or religion
5966055 we can see from examples of closures of several mosques over the recent years very strict control over religion and also arrests of activists as well as people accused of violent offenses
5966056 usually if a uighur gets in trouble the police come and detain everyone in his family then they lose their jobs and have trouble getting new ones
5966057 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not at all respected by chinese officials inside tibet
5966058 there are restrictions on the circulation of information a very strong censorship and often civilians are arrested and tortured very violently to the point where they die
5966059 the chinese response is that if you put aside this nonsense we will make you wealthy
5966060 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks it could be a boomerang storm
5966061 we dont want that we want to live separately and in peace and not to be attacked
5966062 der ffentliche sektor ist f r die sap eine fokus branche und ein wachstumsfeld
5966063 die sap hat nachhaltig in den sektor investiert und stellt weitere mitarbeiter f r den vertrieb und die beratung ein
5966064 unser ziel ist es zweistellig zu wachsen und unseren umsatzanteil unter den zehn kernbranchen von sap zu verteidigen
5966065 im gegensatz zu einem industriekunden ist es viel schwerer mit einem produkt die gesamten anforderungen abzudecken
5966066 die technischen voraussetzungen und die systemlandschaft sind in den bundesl ndern sehr unterschiedlich
5966067 were playing for everyone involved in the club the playing staff coaching staff and mainly our loyal supporters who continue to turn up each week
5966068 it doesnt matter where we play last week it was freezing out at penrith and our fans were still there so hopefully we can give them a win
5966069 for us weve just moved on from it a few weeks ago so we just want to train and do our thing and thats all well worry about
5966070 obviously the guys coming in theres some great signings there and weve got a lot of young kids coming in as well who are outstanding talents and weve seen a few of them in first grade this year
5966071 the futures looking good but for us the playing group and the coach we want to finish 2008 on a good note
5966072 certainly theres not many players available now and theres certainly no other sonny bill williams floating around
5966073 doch wer dort etwas werden will dessen spiel muss free to play sein

5966080 aber daraus etwas f r unsere massnahmen abzuleiten w re verfehlt
5966081 wir gerieten bei kunden und angestellten in diskussionen die sich um die frage drehten ob forbo rieter bernimmt

5966090 our job in this election is not just win although im a big believer in winning
5966091 i dont intend to lose this election john mccain doesnt know what hes up against
5966092 he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
5966093 these are the judgments ive made and the policies that we have to debate because we do have differences in this election
5966094 one of the things that we have to change in this country is the idea that people cant disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
5966095 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
5966096 barack obama has made it clear that unconditional withdrawal in iraq is more important to him than victory in iraq thats not a criticism of his patriotism thats a criticism of his judgment
5966097 he can talk all he wants about britney spears and paris hilton but i dont have time for that mess
5966098 youre an idiot how about being partial in your reproting who are you john sterling
5966099 this post was stupid and pointless what on earth did this display except that youre cranky
5966100 what is wrong with you ive got to put you out of your misery
5966101 for a good time call mr met 718 577 tixx
5966102 i threw up just a little bit in my mouth
5966103 as someone who loves holiday song parodies this gets a big time thumbs up
5966104 sometimes a franchise just has a big black mark over it and no amount of wishful thinking can turn the tide
5966105 hasta la vista baby i throw up the white flag
5966106 we are talking about the countrys musical history that this guy has been strip mining
5966107 we disagree with the administration that the endangered species act isnt a perfectly appropriate act to address global warming
5966108 the pika is very much the polar bear of the lower 48
5966109 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
5966110 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
5966111 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
5966112 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
5966113 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
5966114 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
5966115 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
5966116 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
5966117 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
5966118 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
5966119 people dont usually think about these types of cells when they talk about human embryonic stem cell therapy but it is important
5966120 theres more infections all the time and the number of donors is more and more limited
5966121 whether they would be good enough for transfusion is very unclear
5966122 participated in manhunts persecution and murder of jews in budapest in 1944
5966123 i determine that mr zentai is eligible for surrender to the republic of hungary and therefore he is remanded in custody
5966124 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
5966125 hes disgraced himself hes an embarrassment to the clayton county police department his credibility and integrity as an officer is gone and i have no use for him
5966126 his behavior is unbecoming of that of a police officer
5966127 we havent been able to get in touch with him
5966128 peace social reconstruction justice and reconciliation remain distant dreams in congo
5966129 fewer than half the people surveyed felt safe sleeping walking at night in their village or meeting strangers
5966130 its not the kind of thing that we in our wildest dreams would expect to happen in our hospitals in our wildest nightmares
5966131 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
5966132 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
5966133 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away elections aint that kind of thing
5966134 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
5966135 i think were the only county in the country that has that contract stipulation
5966136 i have a huge inventory of machines that i am not able to use
5966137 who wants to buy a system that has been decertified especially when other states are following suit
5966138 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
5966139 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
5966140 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know
5966141 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
5966142 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
5966143 created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
5966144 this big push is making people crazy thinking theyre bad moms if they dont get their kids vaccinated
5966145 merck lobbied every opinion leader womens group medical society politicians and went directly to the people it created a sense of panic that says you have to have this vaccine now
5966146 i would have liked to see it go much slower
5966147 this kind of money could be better used to solve so many other problems in womens health
5966148 im not against vaccines but in canada and the u s women are not dying in the streets of cervical cancer
5966149 i believe if princess wencheng and her tibetan husband king songtsen gampo knew about the march events they would blame the rioters
5966150 i want to show that china is a big family that needs to have peace and harmony and oppose war
5966151 the chinese want to show the world that their version is the truth
5966152 they always say china has sovereignty over tibet as shown by the princess story they also want to show that minorities are part of a big happy family all loyal to beijing
5966153 im ausland ein f rstchen zu hause ein w rstchen
5966154 viele unternehmen senden den mitarbeiter ins ausland ohne sich zu berlegen wie ihr mitarbeiter die gewonnenen erfahrungen und kenntnisse nach der r ckkehr einbringen kann
5966155 im extremfall hat der mitarbeiter keinen schreibtisch mehr und kein projekt
5966156 haush lterin und chauffeur sind ja in vielen l ndern standard
5966157 im ausland ein f rstchen zu hause ein w rstchen sagen viele expatriates
5966158 es ist eben ein unterschied ob das unternehmen schreibt man bem he sich eine angemessene position zu finden oder ob es hei t eine position mit bestimmten voraussetzungen wird unter bestimmten bedingungen gew hrleistet
5966159 wer ins ausland will oder soll sollte sich ruhig mal anschauen ist man stolz auf die oder haben die nach ihrer r ckkehr nichts zu melden
5966160 wir denken immer schon an die bern chste station wenn wir einen mitarbeiter ins ausland versetzen
5966161 wir achten darauf dass das thema das der mitarbeiter im ausland bearbeitet m glichst sinnvoll an seine bisherige und auch an seine sp tere t tigkeit ankn pft

5966168 swallows are now demanding a transfer fee for mwakasungula initially it looked as if the arrangement was that swallows would continue paying his salary while he gets to play at aces
5966169 however aces have pulled out now that swallows want a transfer fee for a permanent deal at this stage swallows are reluctant to release the player for free
5966170 there is not much i can do at this stage because i still respect that i am under contract though i am no longer in the teams plans

5966186 players are off from may 11 to august 16 but now weve got these international games three days after the start of the new season
5966187 i just hope the players will come back without any problems
5966188 we scored three goals the fitness looked good and we will get better
5966189 we came through without any injury problems and the crowd really backed the players allowing them to play in a relaxed way
5966190 we were a little bit disappointed with the goal we conceded late on but it was a good day all round
5966191 they got a terrific point and have quality in every position it will be their first home game of the season and it will be packed and will be a difficult place to go for our first away game but we go there in good heart and with confidence
5966192 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
5966193 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
5966194 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness

5966197 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman now for me as a christian its also a sacred union gods in the mix the reason that people think there needs to be a constitutional amendment some people believe is because of the concern about same sex marriage i am not somebody who promotes same sex marriage but i do believe in civil unions
5966198 never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few

5966200 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage
5966201 teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
5966202 higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
5966203 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development
5966204 most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women
5966205 young women who drink alcohol may want to consider the longer term consequences for later childbearing
5966206 if drinking continues or increases to levels of problem use their ability and or opportunity to have children may be impaired
5966207 for women who are already experiencing fertility problems or other reproductive difficulties
5966208 the studys findings should warn them not to use alcohol to cope with stress caused by the reproductive problems because alcohol would likely make the reproductive problems worse as well as carrying risks of possible alcohol abuse or dependence
5966209 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
5966210 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
5966211 the big picture is we keep learning more about the contributions of environmental toxins to the chronic diseases of aging for which we never suspected an environmental cause

5966221 renowned for her managerial skill the discipline she demands from those around her and her tight control of all things labour undertakes under her leadership
5966222 she holds generally left wing beliefs with foreign policy perspectives forged during the vietnam war she does not trust those outside a small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in nz known as h2 the notes say
5966223 the department of foreign affairs and trade very much regrets the circulation of the biography by the australian high commission in wellington of an outdated internal draft which was a mistake dfat said in a statement
5966224 commissioner john dauth has apologised to ms clark who has accepted the apology
5966225 ms clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and she had had a bit of a laugh
5966226 newly formed governing arrangements with nz first and united future which happened soon after the 2005 new zealand election
5966227 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient miss clark said
5966228 i think it is a pretty minor thing i had a bit of a laugh
5966229 i thought it was a hoot and i dont propose to release the one i have on mr rudd

5966232 this is a scary league where if you sit out for too long somebody could come in and have your position in a matter of days or weeks
5966233 its not a lot of fun watching guys rotate in and out of your position and not knowing when you get back whether youre going to have an opportunity to get your job back or earn that respect back with a new coaching staff
5966234 ive been a free agent from day one so ive always had a free agent mind frame i could be gone any day thats why ive continued to play like every day is my last
5966235 without my toe i cant run i cant cut i cant jump i could barely walk
5966236 being in a boot and on crutches has definitely brought a different perspective to my life and what i want to do this is something that could have ended my career prayerfully it wont
5966237 anytime you lose playing time to an injury and youve had some success and done some really good things on the field i think theres motivation to get back on the field and show everybody that youre healthy
5966238 you want to contribute in any way that you can and you dont feel good when youre not out there hes a competitor
5966239 i can study study study but its nothing compared to getting out there and having to make a decision in a split second and do the right thing every time
5966240 several of them spoke russian several of them spoke ossetian
5966241 it was five days ago and no one knows anything about where they took him
5966242 most people had to flee the fighting in south ossetia and brought nothing more than the clothes on their backs
5966243 many of those who fled hid in basements and forests until they had to find food
5966244 now they are saying please help me to get home even if you give me a palace here i would rather go home
5966245 i am following with close attention and concern the situation in georgia and feel particularly close to the victims of the conflict
5966246 while i offer a special prayer for the repose of the souls of the deceased and express my sincere sympathy for all those in mourning i appeal for generous relief of the serious harm that the refugees are suffering especially women and children who even lack what is necessary to survive
5966247 i appeal for a prompt opening of humanitarian corridors between the region of south ossetia and the rest of georgia so that the dead who are still abandoned can receive a worthy burial and the wounded may be adequately attended and that those who long to be reunited with their loved ones may be permitted to do so
5966248 ethnic minorities involved in the conflict must be guaranteed safety and the inviolability of their fundamental rights
5966249 i hope finally that the present ceasefire agreed to thanks to the contribution of the european union might be consolidated and be transformed into a stable peace
5966250 at the same time i call upon the international community to continue offering its support to achieve a lasting solution through dialogue and the good will of all
5966251 respect the traditions viewpoints and hopes of the peoples of georgia and ossetia
5966252 to collaborate with the georgian orthodox church in favoring peace
5966253 expressing our alarm and distress at the violent events of recent days in the caucasus
5966254 we support the call for military forces to return to positions held before the current violence
5966255 we recognize that good relations between neighbors are a gift of god and an obligation of all people we ask that our member churches pray for the people of georgia and its neighbors and for all who in these days work for peace and reconciliation
5966256 wang xiuying is almost blind and crippled what sort of reeducation through labor can she serve
5966257 but they can also be taken away at any time
5966258 this is part of the tough tactics used to intimidate and silence protesters
5966259 of course its of concern that china will use a system thats clearly beyond the pale in terms of international standards in terms of arbitrary deprivation of freedoms and liberties to do that
5966260 we have no records of these two names in our system
5966261 so hes getting the same kind of payments that anyone would whos on social security
5966262 i think its reasonable thats the term i would use i think it is fair and it is reasonable

5966267 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5966268 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5966269 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5966270 i obviously know that at the end of the day that the owner has the final say so on whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity or not
5966271 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
5966272 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5966273 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold
5966274 georgian militants located its headquarters in georgian orthodox church in the tskhinvali district and fired from it
5966275 and were subjected to bombing and this was done on purpose
5966276 to support russian humanitarian mission completed in such a difficult situation
5966277 i think its a little more slow progress than we all thought it was going to be
5966278 maybe ed had a sense of that at one time because hes the guy that feels it were still optimistic that hell be there the first week but i dont think you can say definitely right now
5966279 i will be ready for the regular season but i dont know about playing in the preseason
5966280 whenever im healthy thats when im going to show back up
5966281 i dont know if its going to be for these last two preseason games or for sept 7
5966282 these bases have only recently been upgraded to nato standard
5966283 they have been operationally targeted to seriously degrade the georgian military
5966284 there is a presence of our armed forces near gori and senaki we make no secret of it
5966285 they are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of gori and senaki without any guard whatsoever
5966286 there are a few countries that will say told you so
5966287 but many more will want to walk away from the problem and for the next few years georgia will be far too busy trying to pick itself up
5966288 what is a unipolar world it refers to one type of situation one centre of authority one centre of force one centre of decision making it is world in which there is one master one sovereign this is pernicious unacceptable impossible
5966289 the war in georgia has put the european order in question
5966290 we shouldnt make any moral judgments on this war stopping the war thats what were interested in
5966291 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister putin is interested in reasserting russias not only russias great power or superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
5966292 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
5966293 an invasion of ukraine by peacekeeping tanks is just a question of time
5966294 weimar russia is completing its transformation into something else if russia wins this war a new order will take shape in europe which will have no place for ukraine as a sovereign state
5966295 sea surface temperatures of the oceans surrounding australia and the magnitude of enso events
5966296 combined southwest south pacific and southeast south indian ocean data set
5966297 a large discontinuity in the mid twentieth century in observed global mean surface temperature
5966298 for 1950 98 enso linearly accounts for 0 06 deg c of global warming
5966299 its not an option for any coalition partner to default on the understanding and agreement we have made not only among ourselves but to the nation
5966300 we will do it in a way we did with musharraf everyone will be in agreement
5966301 failed to fix inadequate monitoring requirements and prohibited states and local authorities from doing so
5966302 i think it is fair to say that the d c circuit has repudiated the vast bulk of the bush administrations clean air regulatory reforms which were the administrations most notable and significant if not always wise environmental policy initiatives
5966303 we cant have strong enforcement of our clean air laws unless we know what polluters are putting into the air
5966304 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5966305 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5966306 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5966307 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5966308 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5966309 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5966310 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5966311 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5966312 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5966313 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5966314 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5966315 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5966316 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5966317 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5966318 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5966319 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5966320 jades stay at the bigg boss house has been cut short
5966321 due to her taunting of bollywood actress and fellow contestant
5966322 looking forward to reaching out to millions of indians to try and dispel various perceptions that exist in peoples minds about her
5966323 jade had some tests recently then she went off to india to appear in the indian big brother yesterday we got a call from her consultant to say she had cancer of the cervix and so she has to come back straight away
5966324 jade is absolutely devastated she was in floods of tears and broke down in front of her house mates
5966325 it is unbelievable how life is so unpredictable and finds a way to distract and derail you from your plans my prayers are with jade i pray she comes out of this soon and stronger
5966326 i will worry for my beautiful boys if i get unwell i live for them
5966327 i have to keep working to support my family its not an option to stop
5966328 i know it sounds crazy and a lot of people will criticise me for it but i have to pay the bills at the end of the day
5966329 and if i do face cancer i need to make sure i can support the boys
5966330 this time it was awful i started getting really bad pain like contraction pains
5966331 i went up to the bathroom and thats when i saw the bleeding and clotting
5966332 we will have to repatriate him back to vietnam because he is on our watch list as persona non grata thai immigration cannot let him enter
5966333 he could be returned to his homeland since we do not want him here
5966334 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country
5966335 it certainly would be my view that with the sort of record that hes got he shouldnt be travelling anywhere in the world
5966336 sudah buat apa meributkan sesuatu yang fana manusia kadang diatas dan kadang dibawah
5966337 lucy gaffney chairwoman of the national action plan against racism accused the government of
5966338 we should be doing all in our power to promote integration rather than separation
5966339 i find it incredible that after 10 years of net immigration into ireland of families and children from all over the world the government is still waiting on the publication of reports and research before it decides on the best approach for teaching immigrant children in our schools
5966340 what has the department of education been doing for the past decade if it finds itself unable to provide clear guidelines on this important matter
5966341 what can i say im the luckiest girl in the world
5966342 shes officially off the market no one else gets her and now shell cook and clean for me
5966343 the love we felt from the people surrounding us and the love we have for each other made this the most beautiful and emotional day
5966344 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5966345 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5966346 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5966347 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5966348 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5966349 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5966350 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5966351 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5966352 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5966353 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5966354 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5966355 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5966356 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5966357 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5966358 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5966359 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5966360 christopher columbus found the americas while seeking a sea route to india
5966361 if what you want is someone who can spit back nuggets of information then fine you can get that flash cards do a wonderful job at that
5966362 what do they do better because they had algebra when they were 8 rather than 13
5966363 we all want to guard against our children being left out of the pasture well pay big bucks
5966364 what a child gets in high quality pre kindergarten is far more than what they learn from a strategy that is more about parents anxieties than it is about what is best or most developmentally appropriate for children drill and kill does not nurture a love of learning
5966365 im starting to think he doesnt have a disability that maybe its the way hes taught
5966366 the point is not that they know the specifics of a particular item
5966367 the point is that they have established pathways that they can call upon later
5966368 were proposing that to some degree informationally our children are starving were not taking the time to enrich the environment when the baby says whats that mommy how do we answer
5966369 is there any evidence that the ceos the presidents the next crop of patents was developed by children who have gone through these types of rigorous programs
5966370 you are going to go to your level of proficiency you may make it there a bit early or a bit better
5966371 i dont think we have any leonardo da vincis yet but thats not the point i think the kids are in a position to do great things to change the world
5966372 even if they cant speak doesnt mean they dont absorb
5966373 i said oh my god they say youre planting the seed but dont see the roots until later but now and then they peek out
5966374 theres no reason to hasten the physiology and risk causing early failure before the brains even prepared to read
5966375 we can train pigeons to recognize symbols and make binary decisions
5966376 i think im a better version of myself with it thats what i want to give my kids
5966377 youre guaranteeing that the brains growing a lot as opposed to just growing
5966378 my end goal is for them to achieve whatever they want without being hindered
5966379 for me it was hard to sit in a classroom environment without being distracted
5966380 its basically giving high level math and assuming they will absorb it
5966381 shes one who needs new bits once you stimulate you need to keep stimulating
5966382 i think in my heart they get it its preparing them for life
5966383 every one of them does touch the water they get surfed before they ever get shipped
5966384 i got this cryptic e mail from ric that just said i have this idea for a surfboard
5966385 i knew a lot about wood i knew a lot about design i just didnt really know much about surfboards
5966386 the original one looked more like a paddle board this would make more of a surfboard shape
5966387 the thinking was if you werent man enough to carry your board down to the beach then you shouldnt be surfing
5966388 you can make a chair and maybe over the course of a year a few people will sit in it but this is something you can really use everybody can use it its out there in public

5966403 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5966404 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5966405 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5966406 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5966407 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
5966408 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
5966409 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
5966410 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
5966411 i am so sad and disappointed right now we were going to go out saturday night to dinner at one of madronas nicest restaurants and when we arrived it was dark i thought private party earlier in the evening but it has been dark since then no note on the door nothing on the phone message except full mailbox and nothing on the web site as of yesterday can you tell me anything about the demise of coupage im hoping they are on vacation but im not holding my breath
5966412 i noticed a new restaurant in the seward park neighborhood yesterday saffron across from pcc have you heard of it tried it
5966413 i was leaving dulces a week ago thursday driving down the street rubbernecking on everyones business
5966414 mike walker at madronas hi spot said hurleys asking 350 000
5966415 were hoping if someone else is going to do a restaurant there theyll do something different
5966416 what happened to leahs on 65th any word im wondering if it will open elsewhere
5966417 i lost my lease theyre tearing the building down and i found this spot and liked it even if its a smaller place its a lot better than garlic gulch let me tell you
5966418 i deal with restaurants a lot thats whats kept me alive
5966419 im going to do whatever it takes with an all out full effort to get sen barack obama elected president of the united states
5966420 other than sen clinton herself i was tremendously disappointed she was not the nominee
5966421 if she is enthusiastic about sen obama then all the clinton supporters should be enthusiastic about sen obama we all need to grow up and get ready for a historic general election and pull together as good democrats
5966422 it is also very important for the supporters of sen obama to extend their hand of friendship relationship and partnership and healing to make it that much easier
5966423 it is a way to motivate and activate people and get them ready for what basically is a bit of a sprint leading to election day
5966424 what i shared with them is sen obama will ultimately get a little extra effort from me in the general election because as much as i was 101 percent for clinton in the primary i was not against sen obama i was just for sen clinton in the general election i am for sen obama more than 101 percent and i am against sen john mccain so it is a heightened support
5966425 we are going to use the mayor to give speeches coordinate field efforts and probably do things outside of philly too he is very popular
5966426 to carry pennsylvania barack obama is going to need a huge margin out of philadelphia
5966427 we cant use scrum because there is no project we just do what needs to be done on a daily basis
5966428 when needed which is a very much along the lines of the i discussed earlier
5966429 if youre ever asked one of your weaknesses give one of your strengths that if overdone could be a weakness
5966430 weve done all reasonable evaluation doing more will confirm what i already know fps will be minimal and the preliminary analysis that i have already done suggests this
5966431 there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports this is evident from its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity
5966432 i sat down one day with a pile of felt and some scissors and came up with a few designs that i thought would be really fun i ended up with rocket and robot i got some colorful american apparel onesies and hand stitched them on
5966433 my sentimental favorite is robot my son has always had one in his size
5966434 he gets called all sorts of things by our customers clients
5966435 we agree with the report to the extent that it indicates the company has done everything it can to resolve this problem
5966436 this really looks like it is shaping up to be a six month back billing issue or a 24 month issue

5966442 hacer todo lo posible para prevenir violaciones de los derechos humanos al igual que tienen que garantizar el acceso a la ayuda humanitaria
5966443 necesitamos que las organizaciones internacionales de derechos humanos entren en osetia del sur para evaluar lo que est pasando
5966444 instamos a rusia a que retire sus tropas de georgia asegure que la crisis humanitaria es revertida y tome medidas para parar las violaciones a los derechos humanos
5966445 no podemos aceptar que solamente se mencionen en la resoluci n dos de los seis puntos del plan de paz ni que se incluyan condicionantes pol ticos
5966446 hay un trabajo serio por realizar que es la implementaci n del acuerdo de paz y por otro lado est la propaganda
5966447 no hay ninguna raz n para la que las tropas rusas permanezcan todav a en georgia
5966448 si no lo hace se nos har muy dif cil seguir a todos los que estamos inmersos en este esfuerzo

5966450 a patrol car is about to make a right turn when a bicyclist darts out from the side narrowly missing the patrol car
5966451 i dont want to do anything thats going to possibly re injure it or push me back any
5966452 so when i feel comfortable with it i will go full speed if thats saturday the 30th then thats what it will be
5966453 they want me to do everything im doing to do it pain free and that was the case monday im not really allowed to open up and really sprint yet well see day by day when im able to do that but besides that i feel really good
5966454 i feel like i could but its not necessary at this point
5966455 we know hamstrings can take some time but weve said all along it will be day to day steady progress with him and i thought for what he did monday he did pretty good
5966456 the key thing is to have him as close to full speed as possible for oregon even if he had not had a hamstring injury the chances of most of the guys being 100 percent for game day is kind of remote there is always something nagging you or pulling you back
5966457 i got a chance to throw all the seven on seven stuff last week so hopefully the next couple of days ill get comfortable with that again

5966466 now you know what its like to see your horrors mocked the way mine have been thats not mental illness thats a political message apparently delivered quite brilliantly
5966467 there was no significant loss of life in those towers

5966588 this is a landmark transition for the san francisco film community
5966589 its an extraordinary day for the film society and from the point of view of film arts the agreement was unanimously and enthusiastically approved by both boards
5966590 as with a lot of nonprofits we didnt have much of a safety net
5966591 the first two months of the year had a significant shortfall and we didnt have available credit line
5966592 the media landscape has been going through some seismic changes for the last few years
5966593 when film arts was founded the most difficult thing was getting the film made film arts was founded by six members coming together to buy equipment
5966594 i feel very good the future looks really good for filmmakers film arts was in a fragile condition and unlike similar arts organizations in other cities where leading local film organizations have just been snuffed out film arts is going through an orderly transitional phase we worked very hard for that
5966595 i have a lot of warm feelings for film arts when i stumbled onto the bay area film scene i knew nothing i had edited a film together but i didnt know what to do with it i dont know if i would be where i am today without film arts
5966596 for years i have felt a desire to uncover something buried inside i am pulled in two directions by life i know something of what the two directions look like my mothers side a side filled with joy and light and my stern and severe aunts filled with darkness repression and judgment sometimes it is as if i am both those people the forces are stronger than i can understand and the directions both a part of me sometimes make me feel a house divided

5966605 traffic why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
5966606 the most dangerous thing most of us will ever do
5966607 statistically driving in the u s gets safer every year
5966608 most of us hold on to some simple myths of independence and power

5966611 im a midwesterner by birth kind of a polite guy
5966612 california highways make me nervous theres often no breakdown lane on the shoulder of the road
5966613 i just talked to a woman here judy ann lundblad who runs a driving school she has a lot of foreign clients who all say the u s driving test is basically a joke youre on the road for 20 minutes answer 20 questions and they give you a license
5966614 to pass the british driving test it takes on the average 2 6 or 2 7 attempts the british are much safer on the road and have a much lower fatality rate than the u s i was curious about the link between that driving test and subsequent road behavior
5966615 initially i was just kind of interested in road behavior in general
5966616 there was much more to leave out than there was to find
5966617 i had thousands of documents and certain things that could be entire chapters it could be an encyclopedia

5966638 despite more homes being available on the resale market throughout the year developers have moved forward and begun construction on projects that have been in the planning stage
5966639 with a number of multiple family projects still in the pending stage expect housing starts to be at high levels for the rest of the year
5966640 after a strong first half of the year the volatile multiple segment is now readjusting itself
5966641 this brings activity since the start of the year closer in line with our 2008 forecast of more than 200 000 housing starts for the seventh consecutive year
5966642 choosing newcomers based on knowledge of our labour market and experience within canadian society would make canada a more attractive destination for skilled individuals from around the world
5966643 international students and skilled workers would be more likely to choose canada if they knew their time in canada and contribution to canadian society would assist in their eligibility to apply to stay permanently
5966644 by restricting this benefit to only professional technical and skilled occupations the government is setting up a permanent underclass of unskilled temporary foreign workers who will be deprived of the rights to citizenship being extended only to elite workers
5966645 the great majority of temporary foreign workers in alberta do not fall into the privileged o a and b designated occupations
5966646 what mcgowan doesnt understand is the federal government is constipated
5966647 there are about 900 000 people waiting for admission to canada for landed immigrant status this is a six year backlog the system needs a laxative
5966648 if we assume 1 000 people come to alberta this is still a drop in the bucket
5966649 the reduction is excellent news during a time of high construction activity
5966650 we believe were at the lowest rates weve seen for the ici sector
5966651 the rates are pretty much determined at this point barring something spectacular happening

5966670 i believe theres a great big moment right now for intiman to seize to propel itself and move forward
5966671 i want to galvanize the energy and move the institution forward so it is sustainable for the future

5966674 i dont know what happened we looked at the videos and its just one of those things
5966675 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5966676 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5966677 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5966678 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5966679 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5966680 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5966681 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5966682 its not about genres its about good music and bad music
5966683 i have a sense of humour like a brit so i thought people would appreciate that noel gallagher was one of the biggest detractors so i figured that was a cool way to start the show

5966687 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo

5966695 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
5966696 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
5966697 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
5966698 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
5966699 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5966700 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5966701 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
5966702 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
5966703 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5966704 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5966705 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5966706 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5966707 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5966708 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5966709 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5966710 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5966711 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5966712 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5966713 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
5966714 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
5966715 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
5966716 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
5966717 hef was staring at my chest because i had my bunny outfit on
5966718 i would like to say that i slept with hef but i didnt ill dispel that rumour right now
5966719 i did feel very sexy during the photo shoot and i was really getting into it there was a moment there when i thought maybe i should just take it all off but i dont think im ready to be a centrefold
5966720 growing up i was a late bloomer i had no boobs and didnt really look my age the opposite sex sort of ignored me
5966721 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5966722 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5966723 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5966724 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5966725 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5966726 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5966727 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5966728 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5966729 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5966730 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5966731 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5966732 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5966733 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5966734 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5966735 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5966736 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5966737 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5966738 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5966739 recalled holding the baby in the bathroom against her chest in her arms she stated that she wrapped the baby in a bath towel and placed it under the sink in the cabinet in the bathroom
5966740 its easier to tell on someone whos naturally thin than naturally heavy
5966741 i threw some logs onto the fire and cradled diego in my arms i then fell asleep
5966742 due to the alcohol i consumed i was negligent and unable to care for the baby
5966743 he was a caring father this could have happened to anyone
5966744 sound transit is telling us they are on schedule and we have no reason to doubt them
5966745 its as if someone snuck up to you in your bed and blasted an air horn right in your ear
5966746 we ought to be able to live here and get through the night
5966747 whats next citizens tired of all the water around here
5966748 this citys big goal is to dramatically increase its population density
5966749 so whats going to give there will be constant clashes like this one people can deride us for this but ultimately i think the city is going to have to choose
5966750 my husband mike served in vietnam and he came home to a nation that was not necessarily extending a welcome mat
5966751 we want you to know that we will be there every day thinking of you we are going to be there every day praying for you and we are going to be here to welcome each and every one of you home safe and secure
5966752 we were all worried that had the wind shifted it would have burned everything
5966753 as we continue to move to homes that are 5 10 and 20 acre parcels highways are not the best theres a total lack of fire hydrants
5966754 we find almost across the board that what they think they bought is paradise or virgin timber
5966755 there are a handful of people that are very concerned about it and working on their property but its very slow
5966756 everybodys at risk and thats why neighbors should help neighbors
5966757 i just want to get back to work i love being a cop
5966758 im very pleased and grateful to the people of the state of washington for returning me to the high court for another six years
5966759 why should any one neighborhood have to absorb all of that
5966760 given the choice of a roof over their heads versus under a bridge id rather have them in a stable location with a known address
5966761 the reality is theres such an infusion in one location because we have nowhere else to go
5966762 can the state tell you how many children you can have
5966763 im protecting women and children giving them sex offenders a home makes the neighborhood safer
5966764 i really dont like sex offenders im not going out of my way to rent to them
5966765 we know sex offenders have a right to live in a neighborhood but a concentration of sex offenders on one block could absolutely destroy us
5966766 i dont know if he was mad because he didnt find anything and decided well the dogs are something
5966767 but my feeling is if they didnt take them theyd be around here
5966768 it would just be a hassle unless somebody thought they could get some money for them
5966769 it just seems like quite a crazy thing to do to take two dogs that wont really get you much
5966770 the reality is that less than half the people who are going to show up at the general voted in the primary the bottom line is this is going to be a sprint to the end
5966771 i feel momentum is definitely with the democrats moving to november with barack obama at the top of the ticket
5966772 its going to be a tough race but i felt very honored that people would give me a chance to run for a fourth term
5966773 i am determined to win and that means i will take nothing for granted because theres too much at stake here in terms of the future of our schools
5966774 im excited about the number of people that voted for a change in olympia
5966775 over the next few months were going to work harder and get our message out to more people
5966776 its become more important with the top two if you want your candidate in the general you cant assume they will be there
5966777 im very pleased and grateful to the people of the state of washington for returning me to the high court for another six years
5966778 i expect barack obama to win washington state and i expect to be his partner as governor to bring the kind of results weve achieved in washington state all across america
5966779 the reality is that less than half the people who are going to show up at the general election voted in the primary the bottom line is this is going to be a sprint to the end
5966780 its clear that christine gregoires bitter angry combative style of campaigning is going to continue shes in trouble
5966781 i hope theyve gotten it out of their system and discovered that negative attack ads dont work
5966782 i think the public has said stop it lets start talking about records lets start talking about results
5966783 for whatever candidate comes in second theres plenty of time to reverse that order
5966784 i think she has worked extremely hard for this state and i think she will continue to do so
5966785 an incumbent who gets below 50 percent in a primary that incumbent does not survive the november election
5966786 democrats are voting for vaughn and theyre going to vote for dave
5966787 i expect barack obama to win washington state and i expect to be his partner as governor to bring the kind of results weve achieved in washington state all across america
5966788 the reality is that less than half the people who are going to show up at the general election voted in the primary the bottom line is this is going to be a sprint to the end
5966789 its clear that christine gregoires bitter angry combative style of campaigning is going to continue shes in trouble
5966790 i hope theyve gotten it out of their system and discovered that negative attack ads dont work
5966791 i think the public has said stop it lets start talking about records lets start talking about results
5966792 for whatever candidate comes in second theres plenty of time to reverse that order
5966793 i think she has worked extremely hard for this state and i think she will continue to do so
5966794 we carried out an analysis of what pete doherty and his band does
5966795 what he does as part of his routine is to excite the crowd
5966796 the crowd all get worked up and then they start fighting
5966797 the organiser of the festival is now on the verge of bankruptcy why because we intentionally speed up and slow down the tempo of our songs were now in the process of trying to make it happen in a different venue watch this space
5966798 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
5966799 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
5966800 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
5966801 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
5966802 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
5966803 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
5966804 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
5966805 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
5966806 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
5966807 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
5966808 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
5966809 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
5966810 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
5966811 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5966812 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5966813 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5966814 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5966815 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5966816 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5966817 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
5966818 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
5966819 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
5966820 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
5966821 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

5966825 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
5966826 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno
5966827 detritus de la sociedad seres sin escr pulos y sin entra as que en pos del dinero y de la fortuna ca an en punta arenas atra dos por la f cil impunidad
5966828 sangre del gaucho y del indio s lo sirve para abonar la tierra
5966829 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
5966830 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5966831 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5966832 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5966833 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
5966834 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5966835 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5966836 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5966837 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5966838 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5966839 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5966840 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5966841 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5966842 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5966843 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5966844 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5966845 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5966846 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
5966847 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5966848 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5966849 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5966850 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5966851 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5966852 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5966853 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5966854 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5966855 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5966856 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5966857 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5966858 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5966859 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5966860 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5966861 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5966862 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
5966863 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
5966864 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
5966865 we hope sept 11th is a day when americans come together and reaffirm our resolve to address the common challenges we face together
5966866 we ask you to help us rekindle that sense of unity by suspending your campaign activity on 9 11 and engaging in your own personal expression of charitable service in honor of those who perished and those who rose in service to help rebuild our nation

5966868 he loved me i loved him and id give anything to have him back
5966869 over the years every time there is a major election we have had people attempt to put up a listing we catch them very quickly
5966870 when we see these listings we definitely take them down
5966871 its possible that someone would put a listing up its possible to be up for a couple of hours before we catch it its possible that for a brief period of time something might actually be visible on the site
5966872 we are very clear if you engage in illegal activity on our site we absolutely will share information with law enforcement we provide testimony in court
5966873 and what this person was proposing was probably not so feasible unrealistic
5966874 i dont think it will happen more and more as the elections are approaching
5966875 its not anything thats widespread or cause for concern in any way
5966876 people are just looking for an audience they are really using that listing as an opportunity to put their opinion on there
5966877 we have had instances that would be similar in nature where we have sports fan who are really unhappy with the performance of their favorite team and they may try to list the coach for sale as a way to express their unhappiness with the performance of their team
5966878 but hes always been a good player you have to get opportunities in the league and sometimes when you dont you get stereotyped i think thats what happened to j t
5966879 this isnt a guy out of control by any means j t just plays with a lot of competitive fire
5966880 when the time comes ill deal with it sitting is part of the game too

5966887 they were nailing the floorboards down and i came in and the beds themselves the inside was all stone theyd discussed slate which i thought they meant was a color it was not supposed to be a coffin and i freaked out
5966888 they are supposed to feel a little bit like coffins but when they were stone they felt like not just dracula but like louis jourdan

5966890 a completely organic experience from the lunch i had with eliza which is something ive done a few times with her to going home and my wife saying yeah it sounds like the next thing just because you can tell
5966891 a week after eliza and i had lunch i went in
5966892 we are kind of living in a fish bowl a little bit
5966893 sometimes i dont like people to see the man behind the curtain i dont like them to know that something wasnt awesome before they saw it
5966894 you know the things we had to tweak the things we had to cut that is inevitable
5966895 but now i dont think it is just us the whole world is so much about seeing behind the curtain and seeing how things are made and how they work and the extended cut and what we could have done and what we didnt do and the alternate ending and you just you kind of take it as part and parcel at the beginning
5966896 this is a very good idea if she can get clean and still see blake it can only be good
5966897 was ein bisschen wie eine parodie auf die misslungene integrations roadshow des ehemaligen innenministers wirkt ist durchaus ernst gemeint
5966898 wir wollen auch im ffentlichen raum stimmung f r eine faire bleiberechtsregelung machen schlie lich wird in den regierungsverhandlungen ab oktober die politik der n chsten jahre festgelegt und die neue regierung hat vom verfassungsgerichtshof den auftrag das aufenthaltsgesetz zu reparieren
5966899 leider k nnen wir kein ffentliches geld verschwenden dementsprechend ist unser bleiberecht info mobil kein lkw sondern ein umgebautes dreir driges moped
5966900 wir haben einige termine mit reinem informationscharakter andere weisen durchaus auch eine gesellige komponente auf
5966901 mit der gewaltt tigen niederschlagung des prager fr hlings vor 40 jahren durch sowjetische truppen wurde auch auf jahre die hoffnung niedergewalzt dass f r die staaten osteuropas eine friedliche abkehr vom weg des stalinismus und der moskauh rigkeit m glich sein k nnte
5966902 damit hat sich auch f r viele millionen menschen die hoffnung auf freiheit selbstbestimmung und gerecht verteilten wohlstand zerschlagen
5966903 gerade f r die zeit nach dem gewaltfreien systemwechsel nach 1989 gilt es auch die europ ische union als wichtiges friedensprojekt hervorzuheben denn es ist in kurzer zeit gelungen viele staaten mittel und osteuropas die einst teil des ostblocks waren in das europ ische projekt zu integrieren und damit f r ein friedliches demokratisches zusammenwachsen der teile europas zu sorgen und den menschen in diesen l ndern mit der europ ischen perspektive neue chancen zu bieten
5966904 es ist nur engagierten vertretern wie rudolf kirchschl ger als botschafter oder medienvertretern wie helmut zilk oder gerd bacher zu verdanken dass sterreich auch in dieser phase seine rolle als neutraler staat aktiv wahrgenommen hat und durch konkrete taten zur hilfe f r die betroffenen menschen beigetragen hat und rudolf kirchschl ger hat mit seiner weigerung die weisung keine visa mehr auszustellen klar gezeigt dass auch ein neutraler staat in solchen situation nicht parteifrei sein kann und darf sondern auf der seite des historischen rechts zu stehen hat
5966905 dieser traurige jahrestag hat f r sterreich mehr bedeutung als es auf den ersten blick scheinen mag
5966906 die panzer der warschauer pakt truppen sind an der grenze sterreichs gestanden und unser eigenes bundesheer durfte nicht n her als 30 kilometer an die grenze r cken um russland nicht zu provozieren
5966907 nat rlich muss sich die europ ische gemeinschaft von einer wirtschafts st rker zu einer sozial union entwickeln und die menschen viel massiver an ihren entscheidungen teilhaben lassen
5966908 auch als 19j hriger habe ich damals gesp rt was diese niederschlagung des prager fr hlings f r die menschen in der tschechoslowakei aber auch f r europa bedeutet hat
5966909 ein ehrlicher transparenter aufkl render umgang mit dem thema tabak adressiert deutsche raucher und nichtraucher
5966910 unter unsere verantwortung werden wichtige themen wie freiheit eigenverantwortung selbstbestimmung und toleranz die auch schwerpunkte der anstehenden kommunikationskampagne sind behandelt in erster linie richtet sich die kommunikation an die ignoranz und inkompetenz deutscher politiker welche die ffentliche diskussion zum thema rauchverbote und tabak mit hysterie diskriminierung unsachlichkeit polemik und profilneurose steuern
5966911 es ist zeit das politik und ffentlichkeit die wahrheit zum thema tabak erfahren

5966914 die kluge und ehrliche art und weise in der er fast mit einer gewissen demut im besten sinne des wortes seine hohen mter aus bte machte ihn zu einem ganz besonderen politiker von denen es heute leider viel zu wenige gibt
5966915 aus buddhistischer sicht ist das st ndige werden und vergehen ein fixes zeichen unserer existenz in diesem verst ndnis hat auch der tod seinen unabdingbaren platz er ist daher auch kein absolutes ende sondern nur der bergang zu einem anderen werden m ge dieser gedanke den trauernden heilsam zur seite stehen

5966922 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
5966923 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5966924 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold

5966928 i always wanted to play pop warner football but i was a chubby kid
5966929 i was a little bit too big to play with the kids my age so i needed to wait until high school
5966930 im just excited to be playing football im having fun
5966931 i feel like i had to take my lumps in the beginning
5966932 it was tough out there because i was going against bigger stronger and more experienced guys
5966933 i think its really helped me in the long run its taught me to fight through things and i can deal with the adversity
5966934 he comes out here every day and works his tail off trying to get better hes not so much trying to do big plays during practice but hes one of the more technically sound guys on the team
5966935 he is a physical corner and he loves to hit he hits hard
5966936 dont look at him and think he is not going to get in on you he will
5966937 it might be kind of deceptive but he will play you as tough as anybody
5966938 he likes to get in there and get dirty with players and real physical
5966939 at times he reminds me of antoine because antoine liked to get physical they like to jack the receivers up
5966940 to be a good corner you have to be good at technique if you want to play i learned from one of the best in antoine
5966941 i didnt play because he was here but you cant get too mad you knew he was going to play i just tried to learn as much as i could
5966942 i can play the run game good because at my position you need to come up and hit

5966947 i think really what it is is our attempt to broaden the services we offer on kiro when it comes to local news local talk and local traffic
5966948 you have in the radio industry now so many more people who listen on fm than am that ultimately we hope this will lead to higher ratings
5966949 i dont think thats what bonnevilles trying to do here in seattle were very committed here at kiro weve got live local programming from 5 in the morning to 10 at night
5966950 whats most important to us is serving the local community with local programming and were doing a pretty good job of it
5966951 had their ratings been down yes had their revenue picture been as promising as wed hoped no theres really nothing on the fm dial for news talk but public radio so this opens a door for us
5966952 we have a lot of wonderful assets now with the seahawks already here the mariners coming on board in 2009 and well be working with the new sounders
5966953 were in the process right now of looking at the best way of taking advantage of all those assets were taking a look at a lot of things
5966954 all five vote off their score sheets as to who won and you needed at least three votes to win that night the korean got three and so the jury questioned the judges the judge from morocco said he had given it to the korean because he didnt want the home country to get a whitewash a 5 0 decision turns out two other judges had done the same thing
5966955 ive got 18 year olds telling me theyre ready to turn pro now instead of staying in the program
5966956 theres no reason to for every olympian doing well in the pro game theres 10 guys doing better who werent
5966957 none of them are happy about leaving their coaches or being away from home
5966958 the team is very talented we should have all been doing real good
5966959 but everything we went through just with the residency program itself they should put that off it almost seems like they were going against you
5966960 it would have been better off if we were with our coaches where they know us weve been with them for years i was away from my family i wasnt doing good in school i wasnt training how i wanted to train so i was real stressed out
5966961 whatever decisions have been made i just go with it without complaining
5966962 im not a guy that complains the program has been pretty good on my behalf
5966963 i think the audience will really enjoy him letting loose like that
5966964 borat cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan
5966965 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
5966966 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision theres just a freedom that comes with it theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie
5966967 we were like gosh everyones getting to have their cake and eat it too with 40 year old virgin and wedding crashers
5966968 just this little opening seemed to happen with the way the studios were willing to go ok r rated movies seem to be profitable so well maybe open that door a little bit
5966969 you luckily have some hit movies and then you kind of go ok you want us to do another one
5966970 there was no talk of toning it down there was no intention of making a conventional movie in an attempt to reach a mass audience
5966971 anythings possible and so more than wanting to make it an r rated movie we just wanted the freedom to make it whatever its going to be
5966972 renowned for her managerial skill the discipline she demands from those around her and her tight control of all things labour undertakes under her leadership
5966973 she holds generally left wing beliefs with foreign policy perspectives forged during the vietnam war she does not trust those outside a small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in nz known as h2 the notes say
5966974 the department of foreign affairs and trade very much regrets the circulation of the biography by the australian high commission in wellington of an outdated internal draft which was a mistake dfat said in a statement
5966975 commissioner john dauth has apologised to ms clark who has accepted the apology
5966976 ms clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and she had had a bit of a laugh
5966977 newly formed governing arrangements with nz first and united future which happened soon after the 2005 new zealand election
5966978 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient miss clark said
5966979 i think it is a pretty minor thing i had a bit of a laugh
5966980 i thought it was a hoot and i dont propose to release the one i have on mr rudd
5966981 as i say if i was to have my cvs on other leaders fall off the back of trucks you would all have a lot of laughs as well

5966984 the ticking of the clock is one of the most important things in the world for it marks the passage of time it reminds us that another second another hour another day has gone and yet despite this constant reminder most of us go along using time aimlessly failing to get out of it either enjoyment of life or satisfaction of accomplishment we know that the opportunity that today presents will never be repeated that spring fades into summer and presently winter comes and we wake with a start to realise that another year has passed still we postpone theres plenty of time we tell ourselves that is a great fallacy the clock of life is wound but once
5966985 hurry up and go out and meet life head on

5967008 everybody wanted to see how sebastien went on asphalt and he ended up doing a first class job
5967009 he immediately found himself in a position where he was challenging for victory and he didnt make any mistakes whatsoever
5967010 this result has taken him even further clear at the top of the jwrc standings he couldnt have wished for a better weekend and his performance is an excellent pointer for the remainder of the season
5967011 he lost the chance of scoring a good haul of championship points but had the ability to feature amongst the frontrunners
5967012 weve made a conscious effort to move the concept of the condom away from negative association like hiv and sex work
5967013 condoms are actually health products and if you have a condom and you use it you are seen to be smart and responsible
5967014 its a way to show you are a condom user and you dont have any issues with it
5967015 trevor manuel has served long enough as finance minister in fact there are elements of the mbeki manuel economic orthodoxy that need revisiting
5967016 there are 6 5 million people who could be employed in this country if we reach the level of our comparator nations such as mexico and thailand they have 50 percent more people in their workforce than we do who should take responsibility for that huge failure other than the president and the minister of finance
5967017 we all know that bee has led to huge corruption and hasnt yielded the results it should have its diverted attention from the real need if you reconfigured the bee scorecard and gave more points for job creation rather than ownership a great deal more would be achieved
5967018 i think i would back my old friend tito mboweni he knows how to separate politics from the personal with mbeki an attack however mild was deemed an attack on his person
5967019 my legacy has been to actually open space for democratic discourse if the nationalist party had remained the official opposition there would be no opposition today
5967020 who would have thought i would become the leader of the party that is now the overwhelming choice of afrikaans voters

5967047 people on medicaid dont get the same treatment in the emergency room as people with private insurance
5967048 anybody with those symptoms and a blue cross blue shield card or comparable insurance would have been ct scanned on the first visit
5967049 what is more troubling to us in this case is the fact the plaintiffs counsel would introduce issues of ethnic discrimination and discrimination based on insurance status

5967070 perhaps they are overscheduled and need to say no once in a while

5967079 during the winter months jim and i kept in touch via letters and phone calls although we were intimate in a teenage kind of way we never completely consummated our relationship
5967080 at the reception i noticed a guy at the bar smirking at me i was initially turned off because he seemed so cocky as he leaned casually against the bar but he was cute so i took another look and finally realized it was jim i hadnt seen him in eight years and i was ecstatic
5967081 the old feelings came back in an instant and it felt like old times we started making out the only thing that kept me from going all the way was my boyfriend back home
5967082 it was a tough call because my relationship with him was on delicate grounds and i didnt think it would last it didnt just the same i did right by him and refrained from going home with jim
5967083 but i wanted to in the worst way and regret to this day that i didnt leave with him that night i always thought there would be other opportunities when i was not in a committed relationship
5967084 that was the first and last letter i received from him
5967085 what i found was his obituary he had committed suicide just two weeks before id googled him and just shortly after his 40th birthday
5967086 hed promised me that hed be my best friend for life but he hadnt promised me how long his life would be
5967087 its been three years now since his death although we couldnt be together as a couple i loved him dearly and i feel as if a part of my heart was buried with him
5967088 i fix the human chassis i tune up human engines i recharge human batteries and i adjust human transmissions

5967093 you just bit me i would think i deserve a little more from you
5967094 the judges are always so adamant that they want to see the people and dogs working as a team and get upset when someone does things with their dogs they see as negative its one of the things i love about the show even that airs during the show that has someone sweeping something up off the floor using a pomeranian instead of a broom has a disclaimer at the bottom saying do not try this at home couldnt cbs have done that too
5967095 the first time that i saw any of the photo shoot was on television with everybody else
5967096 im the biggest advocate against abuse that there is and so i was shocked by that and was appalled nobody should treat their dogs like that at all ever even for 250 000
5967097 i think cbs and the producers did extremely well in keeping the dogs safe keeping them happy making sure theres a 24 hour veterinarian on call and on set
5967098 the american humane association was there during the challenges i think cbs did themselves proud in that regard
5967099 american humane monitored some of the challenges in various episodes but did not oversee any of the activity at the canine academy
5967100 in the specific instance of the use of a snarl band during the taping of americas greatest dog episode 104 american humane would not have allowed the snarl band or the citrus spray action to occur had we been on set
5967101 i was all ready to tell you it was a good episode until the very end when teresa didnt get kicked off
5967102 it would have been perfect if teresa and leroy were voted out and if leroy were the judge he would have voted himself out of there
5967103 i might put a little peanut butter on my finger and have the dog lick it
5967104 the dog lifts his lip a little bit kind of like elvis presley or something i think they would laugh at that
5967105 i would say any time you can get people working with their dog thats a good thing

5967127 she holds generally left wing beliefs with foreign policy perspectives forged during the vietnam war she does not trust those outside a small circle in labour and her chief of staff heather simpson is known as the second most powerful person in nz known as h2 the notes say
5967128 the department of foreign affairs and trade very much regrets the circulation of the biography by the australian high commission in wellington of an outdated internal draft which was a mistake dfat said in a statement
5967129 commissioner john dauth has apologised to ms clark who has accepted the apology
5967130 ms clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and she had had a bit of a laugh
5967131 newly formed governing arrangements with nz first and united future which happened soon after the 2005 new zealand election
5967132 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient miss clark said
5967133 i think it is a pretty minor thing i had a bit of a laugh

5967140 your no 1 responsibility is to make money and theres a lot of ordering and purchasing and trying to keep costs under control
5967141 youre constantly overseeing things and make sure that the menus change with the seasons i like to change the menu every four weeks that gives you the ability to work with the freshest and the best of the season
5967142 im always seeking out local products im seeing whats in season with local purveyors and its research tracking down these products i go out and see what theyre doing at the farms its like taste development
5967143 i build the ideas and the concepts how itll all work how the cooking stations should be balanced and ultimately how the food will be plated we go through how everything should be done and at that point its the responsibility to do that on a daily basis teaching is the biggest aspect of the job
5967144 i remember going to the old state fair on stockton boulevard with my dad when i was a little girl
5967145 we walked into this big room where all the jams and jellies were displayed those were the days when they hung the actual ribbon awards on the jars
5967146 ive got a big box of ribbons under my bed
5967147 but even after winning so many its still a thrill
5967148 my daughter was taking a wood working class and her teacher encouraged her to enter the fair i make pretty good pies so i decided to enter my blackberry pie in the fair too
5967149 last year i just dropped the pie off at 7 30 in the morning i didnt stick around for the judging because i had to get back in east bay for work and i never really expected to win anything
5967150 this year im taking the day off if i win another ribbon i want to be there
5967151 my grandparents were in a world war ii internment camp after that they were sharecroppers in loomis everything was preserved and saved so i just developed an interest in canning from that background
5967152 thats absolutely devastating when a judge finds a cherry pit an eggshell or horrors a hair thats a competitors worst nightmare
5967153 we are told to sit there and not show any emotion as our entries are being judged
5967154 so i was watching as the judge popped the lid off my blackberry jam and there on top was a quarter size piece of mold
5967155 in 30 years ive never seen an entry as bad as mine and i still dont know what went wrong
5967156 maybe it was a berry seed on the edge of the jar that prevented a perfect seal i still worry about it
5967157 i try not to work later than about 1 a m or i just get too tired but there are a lot of things i want to make at the last minute so that they look as pretty as possible
5967158 i think making it fresh is the secret to winning so many ribbons
5967159 im hoping they will be perfect the day i need to bake my pie
5967160 much of it is very poor quality thin green insipid lacking elegance and any sort of depth
5967161 the biggest challenge is getting people who dont have the first clue about western food to make wine to go with western food
5967162 its so remote theyve never tasted western food and they hadnt tasted western wine until last year
5967163 ive been at banquets with some vineyard workers who are muslim and seen them drinking they dont have hang ups about alcohol
5967164 its not an olympic gimmick for us its a very serious brand we plan to grow quite strongly
5967165 theres not as much cooking involved as you might think
5967166 the no 1 responsibility is to make money and the other part is to teach the concepts with the food and make sure things come out exactly the same every time
5967167 i just found some stone fruit from this incredible producer in placerville
5967168 and dont ask people to do something that you wouldnt do
5967169 when he was young he would always try different foods and his palate was fairly well developed as an executive chef his minds going in a million different directions but hes learning how to manage it
5967170 theres a favorite saying i heard that every chef would like to be a cook if it wasnt for the money
5967171 im waking up at 3 a m with some grandiose idea and get on my computer
5967172 gabriel cant just add six new saut items to the menu without knowing how it will affect the station
5967173 it would be fun to go downtown and play with the big boys
5967174 its blazing fast work but you get used to it
5967175 its more of that sense of accomplishment when you get through a big push i live for that kind of stuff
5967176 if you look at some of the starting prices the stores would never ever really charge that
5967177 if youre looking for value a 7 99 california appellation may be expensive
5967178 if its a napa appellation it could be a pretty good deal
5967179 for them its not a marketing choice its a winemaking choice they feel they get better wine sourcing from around the state
5967180 but those are still good guidelines just as long as you know theyre not foolproof
5967181 i can punch out an ivy league jock but i cant stick a freakin landing
5967182 i just want to be known as the australian diver who did really well at the olympics its everybody else who thinks its special when homosexuality and elite sport go together

5967189 ich mag flower um einigesl mehr als flow das ich zwar sch tze aber nie wirklich als spielerlebnis genie en konnte aber dieses neue spiel es ist auf dem weg ein klassiker zu werden keine frage und das zu sagen ist nicht einfach denn w hrend die grunds tzlichen spielmechaniken spa machen lebt das spiel meiner meinung nach von den emotionen die es w hrend des spielens erweckt
5967190 und das coolste f r mich ist ich bin jetzt inspiriert mich der herausforderung zu stellen und zu versuchen auch etwas bedeutsameres zu erschaffen vielleicht nicht mit unserem jetzigen titel aber eines tages gewiss danke tgc

5967216 a brother recently asked me what was the best way to overcome coldness of heart and a bound spirit when he sought to pray
5967217 the result looked pretty good and the stock has been creeping up ahead of it so there was a bit of profit taking
5967218 is where all the pixie dust comes from it is the center of pixie hollow
5967219 it guided me to the notion of how fairies are connected to nature
5967220 enter the magical world of fairies and meet the enchanting creatures of pixie hollow who nurture nature and bring about the change of the seasons changing the colors of the leaves moving a sunbeam to melt snow waking animals from their winter slumber or giving a patch of sproutlings a sprinkle of water are all within the realm of these seasonal specialists tinker bell thinks her fairy talent as a tinker isnt as special or important as the other fairies talents but when tink tries to change who she is she creates nothing but disaster with encouragement from her friends rosetta silvermist fawn and iridessa tink learns the key to solving her problems lies in her unique tinker abilities and discovers that when shes true to herself magical things can happen
5967221 in autumn tinker bell is entrusted with crafting a great treasure that can rejuvenate the pixie dust tree but when her friend terence offers to help tinks temper and stubbornness get the better of her shattering both her creation and her friendship with terence to set things right again she must embark on a journey far north of never land and along the way she will discover an even greater treasure
5967222 after being confronted by her antagonist vidia an irritated tinker bell retaliates by taking a photograph of vidia without considering the consequences now the two must set aside their differences and cooperate to prevent evidence of the existence of fairies from falling into human hands
5967223 some of the chapters are only two or three pages long because this is not like the julie andrews biography with the and then i did this type of chapter it is more along the lines of short stories or anecdotes about things that have happened in my life i keep asking myself what people might want to know things slowed down because my computer broke i drove to best buy in this los angeles heat and did my best poor little old lady impression but they still said they wouldnt fix windows 2000 but the boy there was so nice and gave me the names of four places that would fortunately i was worried about my computer so i had someone come in and back up all the files a week or so before my computer went down however i cant get back to writing until the computer is fixed
5967224 they interviewed me for quite some time for the latest release of the
5967225 i recently did a presentation for the disney archives talking about tinker bell i would say that about 40 people crowded into that small space some of them sitting on the floor amp afterward three of the people involved on the new tinker bell dvd came up to me and told me how much they enjoyed it they said they loved what i said about tinker bell and her personality because that was the same approach they were taking i reminded them that i met with them a couple of years ago and told them the same thing or so thats where we got the information they said i just laughed i have seen a small bit of the animation and i think it is wonderful tinker bell talks in it but i tell people that tinker bell talks in the original novel do you know the first thing she says you silly ass that really isnt really inappropriate it because in those days that expression referred to a donkey there is this little girl named mae whitman who is doing the voice and she does a wonderful job i think they are going to send her out on promotions for the dvd she is about 5 feet tall and has the biggest eyes
5967226 tinker bell is such an indelible character to pop culture even without a voice
5967227 she is sassy feisty and independent brittanys distinctive voice and superb talent will bring all these qualities to life as well as show new sides to tinks personality audiences will get to know tinker bell like never before and i am sure will fall in love with her all over again
5967228 kids will really like her energy and her feistiness because it never comes from a malicious place
5967229 i did a little show of skits for the national fantasy fan club convention with teri hardin
5967230 i found out that tinker bell is going to get a star of the hollywood walk of fame i would love to be in attendance i suspect it might be in connection with the dvd that is coming out
5967231 a toy shop and a bookstore exploded and i decided to live in the remains
5967232 i am just so angry and upset not just for me for my sons
5967233 i had promised them these tickets as me and my wife separated a year ago and it has been tough for them this was supposed to be an incentive for them to behave and they have been brilliant now i cant reward them
5967234 i thought it was the official site and now i do not know how i can get hold of any more tickets
5967235 ian is devastated and i really feel for him how people can con you like this is disgusting
5967236 we bought the tickets as a treat for the girls
5967237 alice will get her gcse results tomorrow and is expected to get about seven a stars and the rest as so it was a little thank you to her for working so hard
5967238 we spent 344 30 on the two tickets and paid for them up front from what we thought was the official site
5967239 we have bought tickets for festivals before so we know they often turn up only a week or so before but by last weekend we were getting a little concerned
5967240 we emailed the people from the site and they just replied saying they had forgotten to send them out so we could not have them
5967241 we were just confused by it so we emailed back and said could we not get them sent out now and they just basically said that they would not engage in any more conversation with us and that we would get our money back in a month
5967242 the reading festival is one of the highlights of the summer for music fans
5967243 unfortunately it also brings out the worst fraudsters and con artists who use flashy websites and false promises to try to scam people out of their money
5967244 we really would strongly urge people to only use official sites as unfortunately these people are likely to take your money
5967245 we had a number of problems with sos masterticket for v festival this year and we are anticipating that many people are suffering the same with reading
5967246 i have not personally heard of readingfestivaltickets co uk but i am sure we will hear more when people realise their tickets have not arrived and they cannot get their money back

5967248 i felt like the energy was good and the hustle was good
5967249 we werent as sharp as we need to be offensively we had noise and we had guys flinching so that was not good but besides that everything else was fine everybody stayed healthy through it and we got some situations done
5967250 i think the biggest thing is how are we gonna do when its the real deal
5967251 theres only so much simulating you can do because when you put 70 000 people up there the anxiety level goes up thats a whole different thing so hopefully well be able to handle all that well
5967252 i think theyre ready to play against someone else theyve worked hard i dont know that they feel theres anything else that they can do right now besides play a game
5967253 i dont know im not gonna back myself into that corner
5967254 he didnt play a lot versus the first team offense so you always have to take that with a grain of salt but he made plays which is a good thing
5967255 even though weve got some good linebackers because weve made this switch to the 3 4 we probably dont have as much depth there as we need hes a good player hell have to play for us

5967259 everybody here was deeply concerned that this unexpected episode would mar the other wise joyful ambience prevailing here and to me the most telling message god wanted to instill into our hearts is to always
5967260 only 38 per cent of the uks total water use comes from its own rivers lakes and groundwater reserves
5967261 the rest is taken from water bodies in many countries across the world to irrigate and process food and fibre crops that people in britain subsequently consume
5967262 whats particularly worrying is that huge amounts of these products are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future
5967263 most people arent even aware that it takes massive amounts of water to grow the food and fibres we consume on top of what is used for drinking and washing and watering the lawn
5967264 therefore it is essential that business and government identify the areas that could potentially suffer water crises and develop solutions so the environment is not overexploited to the point that people and wildlife lose out
5967265 the private sector has a very important role to play it can engage with governments and communities along its supply chain to support better water management
5967266 in order to reduce risk businesses need to do their utmost to encourage more efficient and effective water use in water stressed areas where they operate
5967267 this is not just an issue for food and clothing companies producers and retailers insurers and investors have a vested interest in encouraging efficiency of water use and security of water supply in an ever thirstier world water is irreplaceable and climate change and population growth are only going to exacerbate the problem
5967268 theres an important role for the public here as a consumer you can ask businesses including your local supermarkets to tell you what they are doing to ensure good water management along their supply chains as a citizen you can urge your government to make good water management a priority both in this country and overseas but if we do nothing to alleviate the acute pressures on water resources at home and abroad then our inaction could have far reaching consequences for people and habitats

5967270 its a great achievement but as owners we see ourselves as facilitators its important to remember weve had some fantastic chefs
5967271 initially there was a lot of keeping tables open in the restaurant when we could have filled them with drinkers
5967272 now weve developed a trusted position with wellington diners and thats a great position to be in this is a whole new challenge for us the challenge was getting to this point but now peoples expectations will be higher than ever
5967273 we are fortunate enough to have a loyal and loving clientele who have evolved with us over the years and allowed us to do what we love
5967274 the arrival last year of chef sean marshall to matterhorn lifted this restaurant from good to excellent it is now not only a premium destination in wellington for a great time but also for seriously good food
5967275 a tuna sashimi style starter left us moaning for more such was the intelligence of the combined ingredients and quality of the fish
5967276 ultimately it was a dining tour de force from go to whoa with energy wit and a superb sense of its own identity stunning produce unpredictable combinations fresh thinking and thorough craftsmanship were the hallmarks of every dish
5967277 fresher better tasting food that has no need of too much work or excess garnish
5967278 this is a very good idea if she can get clean and still see blake it can only be good
5967279 ill be honest the fact that were in a pennant race and coming into september you want a guy with 400 saves out there closing for you
5967280 but teams have to go through this thats why when you win its all about the team
5967281 well just try to match up the way we have been and itll depend on how the game is going as to who will close the good thing is as weve gone through this a lot of people have gotten saves
5967282 im just going to run hard and hope for the best
5967283 im ready to kiss it goodbye at this point because of what hes doing
5967284 south korea showed in the first quarter what they are capable of and i thought we responded in the second and third quarter defensively in particular i thought we did a great job
5967285 theyre a physical team a tough team and im pretty sure theyre going to take that game and take some confidence out of it

5967297 my overall impression is that sun has seized upon a legitimate here stemming from the usual fud surrounding the rationalization and integration of two such daunting product portfolios oracle and bea and more uniquely the purported price increase oracle announced for weblogic in july
5967298 sun is hoping to make some inroads with existing and potential weblogic customers that may find oracles road map and pricing structure too daunting

5967309 it is precisely in issues like this where the interests of the muslims are involved that our muslim religious leaders must be united to promote the welfare of the bangsamoro

5967313 the point is these men have committed criminal activities under the revised penal code of the republic of the philippines criminal justice proceedings are being pursued against them they are being pursued and they must be tried in accordance with our criminal justice system and this is the intent of our operations
5967314 there were so many delays in the negotiations there have been actuations by the grp that they were trying to renege on what had been agreed on already
5967315 is a very telling admission he said the atrocities committed by the milf ground commanders could not be justified
5967316 i think they have to study that statement and we will have to study the extent of the influence of the milf as to these people when they did the rampage that they did
5967317 you all know we have bent as far backward as possible to give peace a chance
5967318 if they keep on saying that line and they continue to fail controlling them milf sub commanders then the government will certainly control them

5967331 you see elliot i havent managed to do anything like go back in time seems its impossible but ive got something almost as good you see the time you spend in this chamber is essentially time spent outside our own time flow youre existing in a bubble of time which isnt tied to our own universe what the machine does is take this bubble of time and stitch it onto the end of our own timeline after a specified delay well thats a gross simplification but you get the idea basically as long as you are in the machine you are also in the future or more accurately a future when the machine ejects you back in the past which is now our present you return back to that moment
5967332 what what are you saying so you just you just
5967333 yes elliot thats right i just screwed myself from two hours ago

5967349 together with the fiesta resort we wanted to do something here on the property knowing that this is where we hold a special place with him
5967350 they took advantage im 52 i play on the senior tour
5967351 ive always followed the seahawks even though im a native georgian i dont know why
5967352 maybe its because we dont have a team in atlanta
5967353 at this early stage we remain confident in our ability to readily deliver production from daguma to the coast for transport to export markets
5967354 i obviously know that at the end of the day that the owner has the final say so on whether or not he wants to give a guy an opportunity or not
5967355 now were calling these teams and kind of narrowing the scope
5967356 i talked to my doctor and he said i tore some ligaments or something
5967357 today was a pretty good day i really pushed it i gave it my all to see what i could do

5967366 those cultures which are far removed from biblical culture risk reading the bible as fiction
5967367 for many such readers the bible is congenial because the world it describes is marked by such currently pressing social problems as famine and plague poverty and exile clientelism and corruption
5967368 it wont be just one discussion there will be several
5967369 paypal will continue to cooperate with the reserve bank during discussions relating to our no surcharging policy
5967370 since launching in early 2005 paypal has always had ongoing dialogue with australias regulators and governing bodies and will continue to do so
5967371 we do not intend to speculate nor comment preemptively on what the outcome of these discussions might be
5967372 over recent months the payments system board has received a number of comments on the no surcharge and no steering rules that apply to payments using the paypal system as well as the mandated acceptance of paypal on ebays auction site
5967373 where no surcharge and no steering rules have existed in other systems the board has encouraged their removal on the grounds that these rules can diminish competition in the payments system
5967374 consistent with this the bank will shortly be holding discussions with paypal with a view to seeking the removal of these rules
5967375 were very excited by the rbas findings its an exciting win for us
5967376 throughout the site ebay portrays paypal as the only safe payment method and inferring that all other methods are unsafe further this message is reinforced through media advertising and statements in media interviews
5967377 they advertise a buyer protection scheme for paypal that is entirely illusory protection in the form of reimbursement of lost funds is only forthcoming if paypal can recover it from the seller

5967389 we are in the process of apprehending them and we will not stop
5967390 they milf are caught between trying to save face of one of their own and really wanting to pursue the negotiations so the best thing to do for them is to surrender these people to us so that we can prosecute them

5967416 women for women internationals work begins when the basic human needs of women are still very great but the seed of stability can be sown our work bridges a critical gap between humanitarian aid and long term development and reconstruction we are the only organization solely dedicated to womens development needs that operates in the heart of conflict afflicted areas in countries such as dr congo and iraq yet our long term commitment in post conflict countries like bosnia and herzegovina and rwanda is critical when emergency relief agencies the media and public attention have long since moved to focus on the next crisis
5967417 it is essential that we pat attention to what women go through as they live through war and nations are rebuilt we often see women in grassroots communities as victims but they are the true active participants in rebuilding their nations the women we serve are the unseen warriors for humanity their weapons are not guns but guts if we can stabilize women we can stabilize nations

5967453 we got the order the writ of mandamus yesterday afternoon it says to immediately issue the revocation of licenses so thats what were doing today
5967454 we are waiting until rev and tax issues its revocation notices and then we will file a lawsuit the government of guam is not allowed to take a persons livelihood without giving them due process without having a hearing its not an issue of pro gambling its an issue of giving the taxpayers the right to appeal before we revoke their licenses
5967455 basically i knew we were gonna get sued by the businessmen because theyre not they werent afforded the right so thats what we were trying to prevent the suit by the businessmen to hear their case and go forward from there but thats not happening that way and we were ordered to revoke so were gonna revoke
5967456 guam music inc believes the order will be reversed as it was issued by a person who is not qualified to be a judge who hasnt practiced law in 20 years the law requires he must be practicing for the last 5 years the decision was done by a layman the order was not issued by a duly qualified individual

5967460 limitations in the supply of blood can have potentially life threatening consequences for patients with massive blood loss
5967461 embryonic stem cells represent a new source of cells that can be propagated and expanded indefinitely providing a potentially inexhaustible source of red blood cells for human therapy the identification of a stem cell line with o negative blood type would permit the production of compatible universal donor blood
5967462 this could be one of the biggest breaks for the early clinical application of embryonic stem cells
5967463 there is still work to be done but we could certainly be studying these cells clinically within the next year or two
5967464 the problem with relying on donated blood is that there are always shortages the ability to generate red blood cells in very large numbers would be a very big thing

5967534 the two offenders then ran back from the bank and towards their getaway car supt cotter said in parramatta today
5967535 en route one of the men ran towards the third security guard who was positioned across the road adjacent to the getaway car and raised his firearm at the guard and the guard in self defence fired one shot
5967536 we strongly believe the shot from that guards gun hit the person in the chest region and flowing from that the offender dropped his gun
5967537 an autopsy this morning has revealed that the cause of death for this man was a gunshot wound to the chest

5967554 it wont be just one discussion there will be several
5967555 paypal will continue to cooperate with the reserve bank during discussions relating to our no surcharging policy
5967556 since launching in early 2005 paypal has always had ongoing dialogue with australias regulators and governing bodies and will continue to do so
5967557 we do not intend to speculate nor comment preemptively on what the outcome of these discussions might be
5967558 over recent months the payments system board has received a number of comments on the no surcharge and no steering rules that apply to payments using the paypal system as well as the mandated acceptance of paypal on ebays auction site
5967559 where no surcharge and no steering rules have existed in other systems the board has encouraged their removal on the grounds that these rules can diminish competition in the payments system
5967560 consistent with this the bank will shortly be holding discussions with paypal with a view to seeking the removal of these rules
5967561 were very excited by the rbas findings its an exciting win for us
5967562 throughout the site ebay portrays paypal as the only safe payment method and inferring that all other methods are unsafe further this message is reinforced through media advertising and statements in media interviews
5967563 they advertise a buyer protection scheme for paypal that is entirely illusory protection in the form of reimbursement of lost funds is only forthcoming if paypal can recover it from the seller

5967592 that made it really clear to us all how important it is to finish races and pick up good points
5967593 so much as i want to win in valencia i know the most important thing is to score well because the big picture is the championship and not just once race
5967594 you get used to street circuits being quite slow with lots of slow to medium speed corners and very short straights but this is almost the opposite
5967595 there are a lot of fast kinks and esses a couple of decent straights and lots of high speed stuff
5967596 its too early to say whether there will be opportunities to overtake around here but there are a couple of hairpins where it might be possible

5967629 a perfect storm of negative economic trends is battering working families across the united states
5967630 healthcare costs are climbing much more rapidly than incomes or the growth in the overall economy
5967631 what is notable is how these problems are spreading up the income scale
5967632 i was really proud to be a part of the club particularly i mean you always are when youre in collingwood you always love being a part of it
5967633 in the last few weeks we seem to have galvanised together both on and of the field and i think its certainly a challenging time
5967634 i think everyone was pretty flat coming off the hawthorn game and to have to sort of walk in on monday morning and have what happened sort of happen and have to deal with it i guess then and there and drag on for a couple of days and then all of a sudden youre trying to get yourself up for a match that your season probably hinges on
5967635 hes got a bit of bruising behind the knee and i think the club said theyd train him friday and see how he goes
5967636 well we need to win and to make sure we play finals so if hes right theres no point holding him back
5967637 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
5967638 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
5967639 because we didnt want to be a slave to anybody elses watered down crap ideas we wanted to make our own crap ideas
5967640 unfortunately we do not expect to see much recovery for the balance of the year
5967641 cofield played well penetrated and did a nice job and fred has had a good preseason
5967642 hes been very quick off the ball penetrating and forcing some issues both of them have refocused and want to do a better job of controlling the inside with the run game
5967643 barry was really committed in the off season with being stronger and he worked really really hard on that
5967644 fred worked hard in the offseason and came back in good shape the one thing that ive noticed is his quickness off the ball
5967645 every time i make a play like that its because someone else is taking on blockers
5967646 it was a good play for our defense as a whole
5967647 with our first group against the run weve been pretty good both weeks
5967648 its something weve put a lot of focus on in camp working with defensive line coach mike waufle we got a lot of recognition for sacking the qb last year so stopping the run is something we also want to be known for
5967649 its just a lot of technique and something we focused on in camp and its showing on the field
5967650 ill be interested to see how he feels tomorrow after being on the turf
5967651 the first ball was up and in but i figure if you face the guys in the gulf coast league and in a ball youve probably gotten a few of those anyway
5967652 the results werent there but i felt like it wasnt bad
5967653 needs a rest and needs these days off in between more than he needs to be a bullpen guy right now
5967654 i dont know what to really say i prefer to be a starter but if the team needed somebody down there id do it to help the team out
5967655 if i had a choice id want to be a starter but thats not my decision
5967656 ill be honest the fact that were in a pennant race and coming into september you want a guy with 400 saves out there closing for you
5967657 but teams have to go through this thats why when you win its all about the team
5967658 well just try to match up the way we have been and itll depend on how the game is going as to who will close the good thing is as weve gone through this a lot of people have gotten saves
5967659 just go out there and pick each other up believe in each other and believe that we can get back to the postseason
5967660 we play most of those teams we need to catch so its up to us we need to leave it all out there this is a playoff atmosphere now where we have to win games
5967661 i know that stuff happens sometimes but catching routine fly balls should not be that much of a problem im baffled ill take this on me
5967662 i was thinking double right away get out of the box as soon as you can push the envelope a little bit
5967663 i had no idea that he was going to throw me out the way were swinging the bats right now i thought being aggressive was the best option
5967664 its a pretty good test if you want to see whats going to happen
5967665 thats how it happens when guys go down youve got to get ready warm up fast and dont screw it up when you first get in there thats what i tried to do
5967666 im just trying to manage the game weve got a lot of young guys in there a lot of guys who havent played together every time i go in there my main thing is that i know how to throw a football i know what to do ive played a lot of games in this league the biggest thing is to lead that group so we look like a unit
5967667 youre going to have guys running wrong routes youre going to have things youre going to have to throw away guys missing blocks that stuff is all going to happen
5967668 the stuff you can control is how you manage your group
5967669 some of the things that didnt go quite as well im sure when he looks at the tape hell feel more strongly about it
5967670 it gets loose it gets going it feels a lot better than it has
5967671 well see how he feels on sunday morning then well go from there
5967672 we have to see how he feels after each step
5967673 when hes ready hes ready im not getting too far ahead
5967674 we hope to have it a starter by tomorrow night
5967675 we have to wait and see how some things come out
5967676 it gets loose and gets going its coming out good
5967677 when they break the pieces go flying all over the place the bats are dangerous
5967678 obviously it is a health and safety concern for spectators and players
5967679 we decided that we need to get more information before we make any major decisions
5967680 certainly you dont want to have any incidents one would be too many
5967681 if i get the ball on the barrel it flies
5967682 billys a big part of our bullpen but weve got to do what we can do until he comes back
5967683 it was nice to be on the other end of one of those games
5967684 somebody elses bullpen gave it up and ours didnt amazing how that works sometimes
5967685 its tough to lose a guy like that if i get hit by a truck the mets move on
5967686 i was gonna just try to clip that metal off the end there but maybe you should take it off first
5967687 barack obamas tax cuts for ordinary americans are three times larger than john mccains
5967688 the way that john mccains package ends up being three to four trillion dollars more is that they give humungous tax cuts to high income people and large corporations
5967689 in this economy in the past six months with over 400 000 jobs lost weve seen the small businesses those with less than 50 employees add 283 000 jobs
5967690 keep them in a position where they dont have onerous health care costs and mandates to provide expensive benefits to their employees
5967691 it is the mentality of the past eight years to listen to the oil companies that got us into this mess and we have to have a different energy policy to get out of it
5967692 john mccain believes that we have a dangerous exposure to imported oil
5967693 it is his primary objective to put the united states in a position where it is no longer strategically exposed by this dependence
5967694 the first and foremost objective is to change the way americans drive
5967695 a second wave of the foreclosure crisis in the united states
5967696 not everyone automatically gains from globalisation and we do have an obligation to help those workers who do not instantly benefit to get an opportunity for the future
5967697 obwohl wir verloren haben m ssen wir friedlich damit umgehen
5967698 sie haben sehr gut gespielt unsere eins zu eins deckung gegen messi hat nicht hingehauen
5967699 they are the team to beat in this league were just trying to get better this week
5967700 obviously when you get a chance to play somebody like favre with the legacy hes built you got to get up for it i enjoy it i got an opportunity to sack him last year in a regular season loss im looking forward to getting another one
5967701 brett favre is very special i like hitting quarterbacks equally it dont matter if it was
5967702 as ive said all along they deserved it not only in our game the way they played throughout the playoffs
5967703 believe me i wanted to win the game i give them a tremendous amount of credit but that is over and done with obviously this is a new year and a lot of things have changed
5967704 its disappointing but wanting to come back for one play to me is obviously the wrong reason to come back
5967705 the only reason i came back is i wanted to play
5967706 i have no idea id like to have that opportunity to make that decision
5967707 i mean that with the highest compliments first and foremost his experience there is no substitute for experience
5967708 ive seen a lot of guys come and go with tremendous speed who can jump high who could bench press more than anyone in the locker room but could they play football when its all said and done that is the most important thing
5967709 we talk all the time l c has been great in meetings great in everything weve asked him to do hes been perfect
5967710 our receiver talent here is a lot like what i played with in green bay
5967711 young quick guys and each one of them offers something a little different than the next we have four five guys that can easily make big plays at any time i like it
5967712 i still wanted to contribute and be a strength of this team i want to be part of helping this team win a championship there was part of me that believed i could still make it back
5967713 i wasnt real sure what was going to happen because he had had so many troubles with his rehab im an optimist but i wasnt quite sure
5967714 the mystics have not moved one ounce in their 11 year history and weve got to start making some changes it is the only way this team is going to survive
5967715 our issue has not been lack of effort it has been lack of talent
5967716 this is pro basketball and good coaching and gutty performances can only take a team so far
5967717 the mystics have been operating for too long without a long term plan
5967718 we are here because we must find a way to re engage these students for one reason or another we are not successful
5967719 were about just moving on and getting the work done with these young people
5967720 we expect to serve everybody here like the nordstroms of student services
5967721 so any young person that walks in that door will be welcomed with a smile and treated like the adults that they are
5967722 this is not a place where were going to give you a phone number and say go make the call yourself
5967723 this is necessary because not all youth are determined to get out there and search and find the education that is needed
5967724 this re engagement center is a wonderful idea it lets students know that there is a better way instead of dropping out of school and feeling lost
5967725 theres a lot of kids out there who feel as though theres no place for them theres no hope and that the school district has failed them and they have failed themselves
5967726 they need to know that there is a place for them
5967727 i can get a fishing hook out of someone faster than shore memorial hospital
5967728 how many of those people do you think will come back here after that they were scared to death
5967729 i said your boats are unregistered your renters are breaking the law it was a liability issue
5967730 if it would have been the marine bureau of the state police they would have issued summonses and impounded the boats
5967731 i can assure you as the mayor that the city has no problems with robin scott
5967732 monday was the day i had all of america watching
5967733 im very disappointed i was looking forward to the game ive been doing well all week in practice trying to show them that i belong for something like this to happen im kind of down right now but i know tomorrow is a new day
5967734 im just going to get the treatment on it get ready to come back out here hopefully i get another opportunity like i had monday to get some good reps in there with the ones and make plays
5967735 hell be a guy that we will have to decide on how we are going to handle that
5967736 i said all along they deserved it the way they played throughout the playoffs i give them a lot of credit but thats over and done with obviously its a new year and a lot of things have changed im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league were just trying to get better this week
5967737 its disappointing but wanting to come back for one play to me is obviously the wrong reason to come back the only reason i came back is because i wanted to play
5967738 i have no idea id like to have the opportunity to make that decision
5967739 i told him he should take as much time as he wants
5967740 youve been in the nfl 17 years youve earned that right
5967741 hed have wanted me to play all along and im sure it would have been in green bay
5967742 but he probably would be out here in jets practice every day raising hell telling me what i could be doing better hed have wanted me to play until my legs fell off thats just the way he was
5967743 and now for my next magic trick as mets interim manager im going to maneuver a team with no closer into the playoffs
5967744 there is a 60 percent chance of blowing out my elbow from that
5967745 youre trying to identify that person and so am i
5967746 the thing i want to be careful of at this stage of the season is anointing that person and then that doesnt work out
5967747 everyone gets an opportunity to get out there and well see what they can do
5967748 im considering everyone from the gulf coast league to triple a
5967749 it wasnt any sort of whole scale changes it was just trying to find the best way to do things
5967750 believe me theres a lot of wasted trees out there as ive always said throughout my career
5967751 for the most part its things that people dont see that we have to get on board with in a hurry
5967752 sight adjustments audibles things like that whats the easiest way for me to get to those is it using the term thats in place or is it coming up with a new term and not to mention changing it up and having more than one term for a lot of things its a work in progress and i think that will be the case all year long
5967753 i was in the same offense for a decade for the most part
5967754 bretts been in the same offense for what 17 years almost or something when you have that comfort zone all of a sudden you have to change your thinking process you have to go ok this word means this here and ok that word means now its a challenge
5967755 we shrunk it the playbook a little with him in the beginning
5967756 weve still been adding some things hes been taking in the plays pretty well and hes been progressing in the process hes been doing a great job
5967757 ive said this from day 1 that its much easier for one to get on board with 10 than 10 to get on board with one
5967758 until they catch him they have to be out here
5967759 if i was the rapist and did all the attacks id be running forever
5967760 this was clearly a frightening incident for the victim and it is fortunate he is not more seriously injured
5967761 i would like to appeal to anyone who may have seen what happened on sunday night to call us if they saw anything
5967762 a platform for expression that is given meaning by the individual who owns it
5967763 we hoped that billy after the rest he had the swelling would be reduced
5967764 the fact the swelling has not reduced and that there is more swelling you dont like to see rest and then more swelling obviously thats not what you want to see
5967765 all theyve told me is to take some time let the inflammation get out of the elbow and wait for it to feel better
5967766 were in first place and were in a great situation right now i think we have a great chance to be in the playoffs and i want to be a part of that to me im very frustrated because theres not much i can do
5967767 the only thing i can do is take my anti inflammatory pills and just rest
5967768 all of us on the team i think we all kind of took it for granted that when youve got billy down there in the ninth inning hes going to basically shut it down
5967769 i think everyone has kind of realized that its kind of a tough job
5967770 john maine was really a guy i was thinking about
5967771 but i think he needs more rest he needs those days off more than he needs to be a bullpen guy right now i thought id see it a little differently when he came back but the days off do him a lot of good
5967772 i prefer to be a starter but if the team needed somebody down there then id do it to help the team out
5967773 perez was another imaginary candidate for me but hes been pitching too well to start the game
5967774 the length of the season is weighing on the young pitchers right now
5967775 billys a big part of our bullpen but weve got to do what we can do until he comes back
5967776 it was nice to be on the other end of one of those games
5967777 somebody elses bullpen gave it up and ours didnt amazing how that works sometimes
5967778 its tough to lose a guy like that if i get hit by a truck the mets move on
5967779 decided to do a soup business and took the money they made and put it directly into buying materials and food to cook and serve women of change
5967780 this was done of their own volition and the whole idea for them was for empathy and being humble and understanding people from different backgrounds
5967781 we do it in the fall and will do it again this fall and hope to continue working with women of change
5967782 this gave the students an up close look at homelessness and the women were very gracious
5967783 this award is designed to celebrate the next generation of progressive activism
5967784 too often the younger generation is overlooked and not given the positive recognition they so deserve in their communities
5967785 this was a result of human error with no malice intended
5967786 the e mail was retrieved before many principals even opened it
5967787 took decisive steps to ensure that the personal information of employees did not go into the public domain
5967788 im shocked an 11 year old first of all was even out at that time let alone breaking into a gun shop
5967789 i wasnt stunned i was shocked i just could not believe that an 11 year old kid would be involved in something like this its just deplorable
5967790 its just a scary thought that in todays society kids are stealing guns like this and putting them back on the street
5967791 this is the scary underbelly of the activity thats going on that has resulted in a number of shots fired incidents aggravated assaults with firearms and in fact gunshot homicides not only here in delaware county but in philadelphia and throughout the region
5967792 these kinds of weapons on the street are the type of weapons that we frequently find used in the commission of crimes obviously violent crimes and homicides
5967793 it just goes to show you how important the community is
5967794 without the witness last night i do not feel these arrests would have been possible
5967795 i missed two balls tonight and thats unacceptable catching a routine fly ball should not be that much of a problem im baffled i flat out just dropped two balls
5967796 i think its two balls im going to say 999 times out of 1 000 maybe more he catches both of them
5967797 if this teams going to use me in center more then i need to be better thats very uncharacteristic of me and of most centerfielders
5967798 he made a great play barehanded and threw a strike to second
5967799 you have to make sure youre safe its a hell of a play by overbay and hes probably one of the better defenders but you have to make sure youre safe

5967876 he did this for sen fumos benefit at sen fumos direction
5967877 and do you admit that which the government says you did
5967878 i have never suggested that sen mccain picks his positions on national security based on politics or personal ambition
5967879 i believe that he genuinely wants to serve americas national interest now its time for him to acknowledge that i want to do the same
5967880 when im president there will be a whole lot more like this not only here in the gulf but also off of our east and west coasts

5967884 i will let no one question my love of this country
5967885 i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5967886 we failed to head off this conflict and lost leverage in our ability to contain it because our leaders have been distracted our resources overstretched and our alliances frayed
5967887 as commander in chief i will have no greater priority than taking out these terrorists who threaten america and finishing the job
5967888 the american people know that john mccain will hunt down terrorists wherever they are and have a choice between strength and experience vs barack obamas rhetoric and theatrics
5967889 any toll increase or gasoline tax will only be for transportation

5967892 its not a popular issue these days why do you think politicians in the past like whitman and mcgreevey increased the debt because the public doesnt care about it
5967893 not a herculean step were not claiming weve solved every problem the idea is that we make these kinds of choices on a regular basis about how we budget and manage our finances we will get ourselves back into a strong position
5967894 each day you get closer to election day 2009 it makes it tougher and tougher to deal with these complicated issues

5967905 im going to do whatever it takes with an all out full effort to get sen barack obama elected president of the united states
5967906 other than sen clinton herself i was tremendously disappointed she was not the nominee
5967907 if she is enthusiastic about sen obama then all the clinton supporters should be enthusiastic about sen obama we all need to grow up and get ready for a historic general election and pull together as good democrats
5967908 it is also very important for the supporters of sen obama to extend their hand of friendship relationship and partnership and healing to make it that much easier
5967909 it is a way to motivate and activate people and get them ready for what basically is a bit of a sprint leading to election day
5967910 what i shared with them is sen obama will ultimately get a little extra effort from me in the general election because as much as i was 101 percent for clinton in the primary i was not against sen obama i was just for sen clinton in the general election i am for sen obama more than 101 percent and i am against sen john mccain so it is a heightened support
5967911 we are going to use the mayor to give speeches coordinate field efforts and probably do things outside of philly too he is very popular
5967912 to carry pennsylvania barack obama is going to need a huge margin out of philadelphia

5967916 its saying that the general assembly can specify or limit what money can be spent on so were glad the court agreed with our interpretation
5967917 a budget is always a compromise a package of not only allocations of money but a statement of policy priorities regarding expenditures of those moneys
5967918 it is important that the monies be spent for the purposes for which the general assembly approved them

5967959 friends are so important they really help to create a balance in life especially the stressful life of a college student
5967960 it is a growing and changing process that is very natural and not without its stress
5967961 often students are confronted with different beliefs values and lifestyles than they have encountered before that alone can be very stressful
5967962 once you get to college you start losing contact with the majority of people from high school
5967963 you really learn who your friends are the great thing about a amp m is that if you have a positive attitude toward people they will usually be very friendly
5967964 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5967965 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5967966 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5967967 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
5967968 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
5967969 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
5967970 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
5967971 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5967972 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5967973 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened
5967974 its just the fact that you arent alone that some of the people here have the same battles as you

5967992 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5967993 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5967994 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5967995 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers

5968011 evangelical christianity is now tragically below the new testament standard worldliness is an accepted part of our way of life our religious mood is social instead of spiritual we have lost the art of worship we are not producing saints our models are successful business men celebrated athletes and theatrical personalities we carry on our religious activities after the methods of the modern advertiser our literature is shallow and our hymnody borders on sacrilege and scarcely anyone appears to care

5968046 barack obamas tax cuts for ordinary americans are three times larger than john mccains
5968047 the way that john mccains package ends up being three to four trillion dollars more is that they give humungous tax cuts to high income people and large corporations
5968048 in this economy in the past six months with over 400 000 jobs lost weve seen the small businesses those with less than 50 employees add 283 000 jobs
5968049 keep them in a position where they dont have onerous health care costs and mandates to provide expensive benefits to their employees
5968050 it is the mentality of the past eight years to listen to the oil companies that got us into this mess and we have to have a different energy policy to get out of it
5968051 john mccain believes that we have a dangerous exposure to imported oil
5968052 it is his primary objective to put the united states in a position where it is no longer strategically exposed by this dependence

5968061 our relationship with india in the same manner is not counterproductive to pakistan it is between afghanistan and india india is one of the great economic powers
5968062 india provided a good educational environment for afghans i was one of them and there are a thousand more like me in india now afghanistan wants this relationship and we hope that pakistan evolves into a good relationship with india as well we have clarity about our objectives our way forward and about what we want to lead into the future this cannot be undermined by bombs

5968068 the captain cannot play if he is limping of course but the fact someone is captain does not make him undroppable
5968069 it was not an easy choice to make because rio ferdinand is a very important player and i like him as a captain but i chose john because i think we need one captain with a big personality in every moment
5968070 he is important on the pitch but also in the dressing room and around the squad
5968071 john will be the driver of this team it was important for me to get to know the players and then choose who the captain would be
5968072 the captain cannot play if he is limping of course but the fact someone is captain does not make him undroppable
5968073 it was not an easy choice to make because rio ferdinand is a very important player and i like him as a captain but i chose john because i think we need one captain with a big personality in every moment

5968076 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5968077 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5968078 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5968079 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5968080 we began to realise that we had something very special
5968081 as a result he has been an indoor cat and has a chip installed in case he gets lost
5968082 yoda is so different that we were concerned that he might be catnapped
5968083 people do a double take when they see him or his picture it is great fun showing him off
5968084 we have actually had people ask if we had his ears cut to look this way but he is a perfectly normal affectionate curious cat and is a joy to have around
5968085 the 11 million per cent they are suggesting seems rather low
5968086 im upset im angry it makes me feel like a non person
5968087 i saw him at christmas and birthdays and he provided money for school clothes and he called occasionally
5968088 the fact that weve never been recognised and then cindy has to put such a fine point on it by saying something thats not true
5968089 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5968090 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5968091 the two offenders then ran back from the bank and towards their getaway car supt cotter said in parramatta today
5968092 en route one of the men ran towards the third security guard who was positioned across the road adjacent to the getaway car and raised his firearm at the guard and the guard in self defence fired one shot
5968093 we strongly believe the shot from that guards gun hit the person in the chest region and flowing from that the offender dropped his gun
5968094 an autopsy this morning has revealed that the cause of death for this man was a gunshot wound to the chest
5968095 all the preliminary advice to me would place the fact that self defence was certainly an option supt cotter said
5968096 significant rattled by the shooting but would not give any further details
5968097 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5968098 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5968099 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5968100 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5968101 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5968102 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5968103 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5968104 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5968105 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5968106 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5968107 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
5968108 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
5968109 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5968110 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5968111 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5968112 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5968113 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5968114 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5968115 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5968116 who are open to doing something on the production side
5968117 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5968118 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5968119 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5968120 it is better to deal with the government than make it your enemy
5968121 sometimes the government calls me a rebel and sometimes the rebels say i am with the government
5968122 the more the rebels failed their people the more the tribal leaders will assert their authority
5968123 users are always looking for more content and search is a key element of their mobile experience
5968124 we are excited to begin this strategic partnership with mcn in thailand where they offer unmatched access to the local content so popular with our community only mcn could help us design build and launch this service in a matter of weeks with the level of quality and performance that our members expect from mygamma com
5968125 buzzcity and mygamma com are leading the trend for asias exploding mobile social networks and we are very pleased that our strong presence in thailand and south asia can support the profitable growth of their services

5968128 i know a lot of family were watching on tv i didnt have a lot of family and friends here tonight just my dad and my agent ill have a lot more the next two games
5968129 they have that lineup that we have trouble getting through in the middle those guys have beaten us up a little bit and looking at hollidays numbers hes beaten a few people up and hawpe too i mean were capable of shutting them down but we just werent able to do it tonight
5968130 we had enough hits and some opportunities but then the bullpen wasnt able to keep us close which is uncharacteristic
5968131 jason johnson had a good seventh inning but in the eighth inning the wheels came off we get so spoiled knowing what to expect with kuo and then when things like that happen youre very surprised by it i hope its another month before were surprised again
5968132 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5968133 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5968134 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5968135 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5968136 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5968137 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5968138 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5968139 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5968140 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5968141 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5968142 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5968143 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5968144 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5968145 my philosophy is simple i like the world of music and there i think global because you have to let
5968146 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5968147 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5968148 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5968149 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5968150 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5968151 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5968152 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5968153 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5968154 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5968155 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5968156 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5968157 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5968158 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5968159 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5968160 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5968161 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5968162 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5968163 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5968164 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5968165 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5968166 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5968167 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5968168 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5968169 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5968170 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5968171 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5968172 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5968173 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5968174 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5968175 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5968176 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5968177 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5968178 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5968179 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5968180 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5968181 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5968182 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5968183 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5968184 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5968185 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5968186 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5968187 here are seven things we learned about providing remarkable customer service
5968188 we want to sell lots of stuff to lots of people
5968189 the reason the typewriter keyboard is in a weird order is that original typewriters jammed and they needed to rearrange the letters to keep common letters far apart
5968190 the first goal of copy is to get you to read more copy the second goal is to tell a story that spreads and then finally to have that story get people to take action
5968191 you cannot create a brand before you create a business
5968192 this is a strategically significant deal for inspired the us market represents a very exciting opportunity for us as it is one that is relatively untapped for swp gaming our partnership with iceskill will help to open up the market and its commitment to developing state of the art networked interactive skill based tournament games complements our ambition to bring the benefits of our platform to bars across the us
5968193 na ja das gro e zittern wird die gestrige nato sitzung zur georgien krise in moskau nicht gerade ausgel st haben
5968194 das m chtigste milit rb ndnis der welt will nicht mit handfesten massnahmen auf die russische machtdemonstration in georgien reagieren das ist kein spektakul rer aber ein kluger entscheid noch ist nicht wirklich klar was russland mit dem einmarsch in georgien erreichen wollte russland hat sich bei aller brutaler machtanwendung letztlich im zaum gehalten tiflis wurde nicht besetzt die strategisch wichtigen lpipelines nicht angefasst moskau weiss dass es seine eigenen grossen wirtschaftlichen interessen im westen aufs spiel setzt wenn es diese selbst provozierte krise eskalieren l sst auch aus diesem grund w re es falsch gewesen jetzt mit harten massnahmen russland in die isolation zu dr ngen
5968195 die zeit ist vorbei in der russland in einer mischung aus versch chterung und bewunderung auf das europ ische modell geblickt hat
5968196 was die europ er am meisten verwirren m sste das ist die tatsache dass all dies jetzt in einer phase geschieht in der russland und die europ ische union doch ausgezeichnete gr nde f r eine verst ndigung h tten die russen haben l und gas und wir haben das kapital die technologie und die wirtschaftskultur die russland braucht um die verlorene zeit wieder aufzuholen der hintergrund ist vergleichbar der lage nach dem zweiten weltkrieg als frankreich deutschland und anderen europ ischen l ndern eine hnliche zusammenarbeit vorgeschlagen hatte damals ging es um den wiederaufbau eines zerst rten kontinents nach dem ende des kalten krieges brauchen wir heute ein europ isch russisches zusammengehen auf den feldern energie und entwicklung wenn wir den weg gehen werden auch die usa entdecken dass es andere formen des zusammenlebens mit russland gibt und sie werden dankbar daf r sein
5968197 im westen georgiens gab es kein zeichen eines r ckzugs russischer truppen die realit t im land macht das waffenstillstandsabkommen l cherlich allerdings k nnen weitere ultimaten gegen ber russland mehr schaden als n tzen doch die nato kriegsschiffe sollten so lange im schwarzen meer bleiben bis der r ckzug abgeschlossen ist und die organisation f r sicherheit und zusammenarbeit in europa osze sollte darauf bestehen russische friedenstruppen in der region durch eigene zu ersetzen eu und nato sollten zudem klare mechanismen vereinbaren um russland zu isolieren falls es den r ckzug noch weiter hinausz gert
5968198 die nato brauchte zehn tage bis es ein treffen zu georgien gab

5968220 russia is very clearly isolating itself its becoming more and more the outlaw in this conflict
5968221 they intend and probably still do intend to strangle georgia and its economy
5968222 does anybody really doubt that russia could use its overwhelming military advantage to beat up on a small neighbor well thats what theyve done
5968223 reports of the use of munitions that should never be used against civilians
5968224 the message is very clear and we will continue to consider what further consequences are appropriate as russia demonstrates this kind of behavior
5968225 we have provisionally found that there are significant competition problems arising from baas common ownership of seven uk airports
5968226 this is evident from a large number of factors including its lack of responsiveness to the needs of its airline customers and a lack of initiative in planning capacity this has resulted in investment that is not tailored to the requirements of airport users and lower levels and quality of service for both airlines and passengers
5968227 we take the opposite view unless the market is opened up to competition there is a serious risk that the current capacity constraints will persist certainly longer than in a better functioning market
5968228 just as the government is about to make the decisions that could lead to the first full length runways being built in the south east since the second world war the commission risks creating uncertainty delay and confusion at exactly the wrong time

5968249 a supportive group of friends classes lectures it was like a clubhouse
5968250 i used to collect plants all over the presidio one early spring in the 1950s i found that one manzanita and knew it was something different it had been collected 50 years earlier by katherine brandegee and not seen since
5968251 the prevailing winds from the west are cooled over the water then when they blow inland their water holding capacity increases so the moisture in them doesnt precipitate in winter when the land is colder that reverses
5968252 a lot of groups including the annuals began to evolve rapidly and produce whole clusters of new species this gave the flora an originality and tremendous richness also the coast ranges are one of the most geologically complex places on earth add the rapidly changing climate and you have so many individual habitats for plants and animals to evolve in
5968253 some plant species have very narrow distributions and are in danger of being eliminated by climate change
5968254 a recent study found that half of californias endemic plants are in danger over the next decade from climate change alone
5968255 the botanical gardens and seed banks should play an ever more important role in preserving species
5968256 they can afford a bridge to new habitats or keep the plants in cultivation until new strategies are worked out
5968257 its very interesting that the u s is the only country where there is a controversy over evolution
5968258 why there is a controversy befuddles me there have been millions of observations of dna every one of them fully compatible with an evolutionary explanation of descent
5968259 we are now using 120 percent of what the world produces up from 70 percent in 1950
5968260 just like the provisions of the do not call registry these changes will protect consumers privacy

5968262 we are in a perfect storm of uncontrollable fuel costs and falling demand
5968263 airlines could lose as much as 6 1 billion us dollars this year already some 25 airlines in our financial systems have gone bust greater than immediately following 9 11 and we are bracing for more

5968266 as every traveller knows the system remains an uncoordinated mess because governments are not thinking or acting globally
5968267 these may be spring paintings but they can hardly be called festive the ellipsis appears and disappears into a void deliberately shown distorted as death is the ultimate theme
5968268 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
5968269 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5968270 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold
5968271 arts is integral to the sky platform and we now have the wealth and breadth of diverse arts content to warrant two dedicated arts channels at a time when other broadcasters commitment to the arts is open to question we firmly believe in giving our customers the best choice all delivered in the highest possibly quality hd this is further evidence of our commitment to invest in the content that people love and demonstrates how pay tv can meet viewers individual needs

5968276 good transport links are vital to our being able to stage such an event and a good number of our guests from all over the world come to switzerland by air from now on they may even get here on the locarno
5968277 we are the national airline of the whole of switzerland

5968280 every gallery here was stacked full of paintings and sculpture
5968281 figurative art is not very fashionable and i think its because people have got this notion that its about views of venice and portraits and nudes and that sort of stuff out of 2 700 entries we didnt have a single view of venice we want to show that there are works of figurative art which are edgy which are topical which are handling difficult issues
5968282 we were very pleased with how the car was received
5968283 the 200 000 it raised is not only an amazing amount of money for a car but it was also a significant sum towards the total we raised for charity we are absolutely delighted
5968284 i get way too overwhelmed if i focus on the larger global picture but as a mom i can do these small things on the ecomom alliance list and know im doing something positive and protective
5968285 they came in with hooks imbedded in them in different places
5968286 with fishing line wrapped around them which would interfere with their ability to do well everything

5968288 three sites mattewara madhepura and khaira bet are still very sensitive we are adopting some measures to check floods but it is too late we can only put sand bags now while earlier we could have strengthened the bundh by stonelining it

5968290 i have asked bajaj to look into the matter and fix responsibility we will deduct the money from the salary of the person found responsible besides i have asked him to take such matters seriously if they do not care about the court who would they care about then
5968291 i would even go to the extent of suspending erring employees if they are not able to cite valid reasons for their absence
5968292 within a fortnight things will be normal we will definitely work on the lines of getting job openings for our students
5968293 at the time of admission the institute authorities promised assured jobs to students but all these assurances turned out to be a pack of lies as after spending such a huge amount we have not been given jobs by the aviation institute
5968294 the placement interviews conducted at gurgaon and delhi by the institute turned out be a hollow affair it was just like a vacation as after spending a week at these institutes we were not selected
5968295 an action will certainly be taken against those involved in the admission of students on a preferential basis
5968296 we booked a cylinder 15 days ago but it is yet to arrive despite having two cylinders we are suffering as the second cylinder is also about to finish we have been calling our gas agency time and again but to no avail
5968297 black marketers are making the most of the situation due to shortage delivery men refuse to give us cylinders but we have seen them easily passing the cylinders to people who are willing to pay extra which is unfair
5968298 the booking period has increased slightly for those who are not misusing a gap of 21 days is quite reasonable
5968299 the festival season has begun and we will intensify checking so as to ensure that there is no misuse we have formed teams with officials of gas companies

5968303 i am friendly with many artists in mumbai and am organising exhibitions to help them but this time i wanted to do something for the artists from punjab as they have no platform to showcase their talent
5968304 it is equally important for the common man to realise the importance of art in ones life for motivation and entertainment

5968314 we are seeing a perfect storm of negative economic trends threatening working families in the united states
5968315 while gas and food prices are increasing and home values are declining the rise in health care costs is surpassing income growth and fewer people have adequate insurance as a result working people are struggling to pay their bills and accruing medical debt
5968316 the current economic slowdown makes it even more urgent for a new administration to make universal and affordable health insurance a high priority in 2009 to ensure that no american suffers financial hardship as a result of serious illness

5968331 there are a lots of alternative therapies being promoted by people who say theyre fantastic but when theyre subjected to objective evaluation they dont work
5968332 tucson should be proud of a presidential visit no matter who it is
5968333 whats probably impressed a lot of people or shocked a lot of people and i dont know why but hes been playing solid defense
5968334 the other night he did a phenomenal job on dirk nowitzki people try to criticize him about that but hes been doing a phenomenal job defensively for us
5968335 we know how it is to come on a team like this with 12 of the best players in the world and not have to score 30 points a night we dream about the day that we can play on our own nba team and not have to score 30 a night and hope to get a win
5968336 they play 44 minutes every other night its hard to play that many minutes in three or four games a week and play both offensively and defensively its very difficult all of these guys when you watch them theyre putting most of their energy on the offensive end thats what their teams need here we dont need that
5968337 we know that we can score the ball better than anybody out there in the world but if we dont stop nobody on this team we dont win

5968358 in conclusion we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
5968359 furthermore our data suggest that ectopic misplaced fat accumulation in the liver may be more important than visceral fat in the determination of such a beneficial phenotype in obesity
5968360 among u s adults 20 years and older 23 5 percent approximately 16 3 million adults of normal weight adults were metabolically abnormal whereas 51 3 percent approximately 35 9 million adults of overweight adults and 31 7 percent approximately 19 5 million adults of obese adults were metabolically healthy
5968361 in conclusion the lowest 25 oh d quartile less than 17 8 nanograms per milliliter is associated with a higher risk of all cause mortality in the general u s population
5968362 further observational studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish the mechanisms underlying these observations

5968373 the los angeles county sheriffs department was motivated at least in part by a desire to seize and forfeit the ranch for the government based in part upon the possibility of forfeiture the sheriffs deputy obtained a search warrant that was not supported by probable cause the search warrant became donald scotts death warrant

5968381 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide

5968383 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes

5968386 this is the first study in europeans to show a beneficial association on wet amd from the consumption of oily fish and is consistent with results from studies in the usa and australia
5968387 two 3oz servings a week of oily fish such as salmon tuna or mackerel provides about 500 mg of dha and epa per day

5968389 rna based drugs might provide a course of treatment for people whose cholesterol levels are resistant to current drugs or they might be combined with current drugs
5968390 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
5968391 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5968392 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold

5968395 the united states pakistan relationship is going to become stronger as a result of musharraf leaving the scene
5968396 every time he took away peoples civil liberties every time somebody went to prison every time somebody went missing and joined the ranks of the disappeared every action of musharraf angered people against the united states that factor is now gone
5968397 at different levels of being discredited the united states was holding onto a very narrow base which was not good for pakistan and not good for the united states
5968398 its a big country its a complex place there are 165 million people we cant just do it all through authoritarian rulers or through the military we have to push the democratic opening thats taking place there

5968401 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5968402 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5968403 they had to use an abstract representation of for example the fiveness of the bangs and the fiveness of the counters
5968404 thus basic numerical concepts do indeed appear to depend on an innate mechanism this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic
5968405 although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically

5968413 the support that sen obama is receiving in the host cities of both conventions speaks to the desire for change that reaches across regional and partisan lines
5968414 the city of denver is democratic but the state is obviously republican
5968415 i think part of it will relate to the fact that the convention is here and the democratic convention has been a real plus for obama in denver
5968416 but it is also a reflection that colorado is very tech conscious and obama reaching through the internet to raise money has played well here
5968417 denver has always been more progressive than many other metro areas in the intermountain west
5968418 i am not putting it up there with seattle or portland but in the intermountain west denver has always been a progressive place

5968430 this is a clear violation of the fundamental rights of individuals to live and practice their faith forcing doctors to have to choose between being a doctor and being a christian in the state of california is an outrageous violation of the fundamental rights of every american to be able to practice their faith and not to have to leave their occupation because of it
5968431 this is not about denying people services this is instead about the thought police attempting to censor christian beliefs and christian perspectives that dont agree with homosexuality were talking about individuals being able to force doctors or other professionals to violate their faith in order to keep their job
5968432 for example lawyers who are engaging in marriage and family law can now be forced to execute documents for homosexuals adopting children and individual with a wedding service despite their christian faith to the contrary can now be forced to conduct wedding services and wedding preparations for lesbian or homosexual male couples

5968436 ringtones have become such personal statements that a specially created condom ringtone seemed just the right way of combining a practical message with a fun approach
5968437 the idea is to tackle the inhibitions and taboos that can be associated with condoms
5968438 it is not a problem related to ethnicity or religion
5968439 we can see from examples of closures of several mosques over the recent years very strict control over religion and also arrests of activists as well as people accused of violent offenses
5968440 usually if a uighur gets in trouble the police come and detain everyone in his family then they lose their jobs and have trouble getting new ones

5968490 when hes gassed he still covers more ground than a lot of short people

5968589 its affecting our port its affecting the fishermen its affecting the fish we eat and the people swimming in the sea
5968590 the sewage has no border and has spread right along our coastline
5968591 since sanctions it is very difficult to get the ingredients i need
5968592 we have had to cut production drastically to keep going
5968593 i thought things would improve with the ceasefire and that more things would be allowed into gaza but nothing changed nothing changed at all
5968594 you dont know what might happen its the 110 hurdles hopefully we can win gold and silver me and david payne we have the ability
5968595 i ran 20 good hurdles i have 20 more to go to get to my ultimate goal im happy i made it to the next round
5968596 its always disappointing when you lose the two best competitors ever to run the race
5968597 once they all line up at this level its anyones medal
5968598 i hit hurdles eight and nine and gave away a lot of ground
5968599 i have the medal and im holding it but its so surreal
5968600 its a blessing its going to hit me in the morning and im going to cry
5968601 she would sit down and talk to our track club and say you can go after your dreams
5968602 this is what the olympics is all about nobody knew her before this and now shes olympic gold medalist she represented her city and her country with pride
5968603 sir you want t shirt t shirt for lady t shirt for wife
5968604 i was definitely in control of the race and i got to the 320 mark and my right hamstring grabbed on me i just couldnt move it anymore i tried to hold them off and i just couldnt
5968605 i need to finish a lot better than i did today i need to have a perfect race and probably a little luck
5968606 it wasnt fun i wasnt feeling that runners high but im in the finals thats all that matters
5968607 we have three women in the final im really proud to be part of that i think we are making a statement
5968608 i need some change would you please break this mao bill into two mao bills and five mao bills
5968609 how can i miss you if you wont go away
5968610 hes been in china two hours and hes already messed up this country
5968611 i was out there trying to throw and i felt like i didnt have anything on the ball
5968612 the ball felt like a feather like i didnt have anything behind it its very very frustrating warming up i felt good and to get on the mound and feel like that is very disappointing
5968613 its been a long time since weve won a series
5968614 were in a serious funk the whole goal when you come into a season is to win series and for whatever reason we cant
5968615 his hands arent staying back hes anxious but carlos is a young kid and you learn more from slumps than from success and hes going to learn from this
5968616 if anyone got on he was going to be in the game
5968617 it was very similar to the groin strain i had in may it was something i felt like i could pitch through youre accepting responsibility when you take the mound at full speed or half speed and thats why i never wanted to make a big deal about it if it was significant enough to make a big deal about i should take myself out of the game
5968618 the past 10 days or so he feels back in line toward home plate
5968619 hes on top of the ball a little more he has good bite on his breaking ball and hes keeping his arm and his hand up
5968620 it just means were starting to do things in the right way
5968621 were making less mistakes were starting to believe in what were doing it just validates the work that weve done
5968622 i dont think weve played particularly bad in any of these games but tonight was one bad inning
5968623 when youre doing good theyre on your side when youre doing bad theyre completely against you
5968624 the way i guess what front runner means and the way i think about it is completely different from what theyre using it
5968625 like i said theyre on your side theyre demanding fans everybody knows that when youre doing good theyre on your side
5968626 when youre not doing good theyre going to let you know we expect better we want better and we want it now and i think they feel that by doing that they can influence the way you play but when youre giving off that negative energy it really doesnt
5968627 people can take it how they want it wasnt a false statement but it wasnt trying to take a cheap shot at anyone either
5968628 its been a good experience learning how important you are to the team and things you can and cant get away with whether theyre accidental or on purpose
5968629 but thats a part of being a leader also theres always more heat placed on you more attention placed on you because youre one of the guys your team is counting on to guide the team to the promised land
5968630 every season everybody doesnt have to pitch at every level to get to the big leagues
5968631 i think its more important for them to have a good season where they are and build off that for next year whatever that brings next year well see
5968632 i think were going to be covered from within guys are going to matriculate as the normal progression allows
5968633 i dont think it would be right for my teammates me coming in and checking the score
5968634 as much as i want to see it i have a responsibility to my team and guys on the field
5968635 the key thing is to have him as close to full speed as possible because even if he had not had a hamstring injury the chances of most of the guys being 100 percent for game day is remote there is always something nagging
5968636 the mystics have not moved one ounce in their 11 year history and weve got to start making some changes it is the only way this team is going to survive
5968637 if i cant move the marker here im going to lose my fan base im going to lose my corporate support and i just might as well shut down and i dont want to do that i want to make a difference in this team i want a winning team

5968642 my forehand is my strength but that was not working well besides i erred on crucial points and had no chance
5968643 after i lost the third game i was disturbed and i needed to calm down and pull myself together but i really dont know what happened i just could not execute my plans nothing really worked against him i was erratic in the beginning and faltered in the second game when i needed to hold my nerve in the fourth i tried to crawl back into the match but fluffed things trying to play on to his body

5968689 i was kind of surprised they gave it a hit
5968690 especially when the guys got a no hitter in the ninth but thats not whats important we got beat tonight we didnt play well when youve got more errors than hits its not a good night

5968701 the response and feedback we received from the conference participants in sydney was very encouraging we were quite pleased to share our advances with such a respected group of our fellow researchers and industry peers with our preclinical programs now almost complete microislet p is poised to move into human clinical testing

5968714 i felt nervous for myself but i didnt really care how the scores came up and how the placements finished i just wanted to give the best routine i could i didnt want to leave the olympics feeling like i could have done better or i could have ended better i wanted to finish it off as best i could i think i did

5968733 we are asking the commission to develop and adopt a long term vision and strategy to improve the effectiveness of environmental regulation
5968734 too complex and results in a system that is not always proportionate responsive or predictable
5968735 we need to move away from an agenda driven solely by administrative burden to one whose primary focus is improving the effectiveness of the delivery of environmental outcomes
5968736 enhance the reputation of environmental legislation and free up resources to better focus on new and big environmental challenges such as climate change
5968737 approaches and mechanisms where a harmonised approach across member states is required
5968738 target effort on higher risk businesses or substances and adopt a more proportionate approach towards lower risk businesses or substances while still protecting environmental outcomes

5968749 he is important on the pitch but also in the dressing room and around the squad
5968750 john will be the driver of this team it was important for me to get to know the players and then choose who the captain would be

5968752 prevention of norovirus infection will require a robust immune response and our search for a good adjuvant has led us to immuneregens material
5968753 we welcome this interaction with their scientists and hope to be able to determine if viprovex is well matched with our antigen in the next six months
5968754 the ability of viprovexs active ingredient sar9 met o2 11 substance p to generate not only antibody mediated responses but also support cellular responses via activation of specific immune cells gives us strong reason to expect adjuvant activity when coupled with vaccines such as those being developed by the biodesign institute
5968755 with our compound able to stimulate the immune system via both antibody and cellular immune responses to co administered protein and dna immunogens we optimistically anticipate a productive collaboration with dr arntzens team

5968764 infectious diseases create an enormous burden on the worlds population from both a human suffering and an economic development perspective
5968765 one of the major challenges we face in stopping infectious disease outbreaks is predicting how control strategies such as vaccines will work by using computer models to conduct epidemiology in silicon we will be able to test the impact of new candidate vaccine technologies and select the most effective strategies
5968766 many infectious diseases are preventable by simple vaccination yet children in poor countries die of these diseases because they lack access to vaccines
5968767 by providing computer models to aid in decision making we will support efforts by the gates foundation and other partners to make vaccines safer and easier to administer and ultimately protect more children and adults against deadly infectious diseases

5968773 the results of this study are interesting however we already know that type 2 diabetes can be undetected for up to 12 years before it is diagnosed therefore although the study measures the effect of early weight loss for four years from the point of diagnosis we cant be certain how long participants actually had the condition before they began the study it is possible that those who benefited most from the effects of weight loss soon after being diagnosed had only recently developed type 2 diabetes an early diagnosis gave them the best chance of effectively controlling it and reducing their risk of serious complications
5968774 equally those who did not benefit as much from early weight loss may have had the progressive condition for longer which could have made it more challenging to control
5968775 maintaining a healthy weight is key to good diabetes control eating a healthy balanced diet and taking regular physical activity is the best way of doing this poorly controlled diabetes increases the risk of serious complications such as heart disease stroke kidney failure blindness and amputation
5968776 by being able to silence certain genes we may be able to suppress genes that can cause diseases such as hiv aids cancer inflammation and diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems we now know we can focus on these genes and potentially change the ultimate course of many diseases that have a major impact on peoples lives
5968777 if it were true that older kids are able to learn at a faster rate then the differences in test scores should get bigger as kids progress and the material gets more difficult but we really see the opposite
5968778 kids learn at lot before kindergarten especially if theyre in preschool one way to think about it is that the oldest kid in kindergarten has about 20 percent more life experience
5968779 but once they start they basically learn at the same rate
5968780 older kids may do better at first but theres a tradeoff
5968781 theyre also a year in school behind other kids their own age at the end of the line somehow that year will catch up to them they start work a year later and parents have an extra year of child care costs if they delay entry so its not free
5968782 what we think is going on is that teachers are comparing younger kids to older classmates and the younger kids tend to stand out
5968783 they stand out either as not doing as well or they tend to stand out as being more hyperactive
5968784 older kids do better at first and younger kids do worse but they catch up
5968785 the thing is schools are making profound decisions based on these differences differences that tend to fade away
5968786 its clear the pattern is these academic differences get smaller as kids get older
5968787 it doesnt seem reasonable to us that there could be large long term gains from starting kindergarten at an older age when there isnt much of an effect for kids in eighth grade
5968788 whether they go to school earlier or later thats really not going to matter much at the end of the day

5968832 the role of security information and risk management and compliance
5968833 organizations of all sizes are compelled to demonstrate compliance with industry and government regulations industry standards and best practices or internal policies related to information security
5968834 these policies as the explicit expression of an organizations business objectives and their view of the optimal balance between protection compliance and profit provide the foundation for the most effective security governance risk management and compliance programs although their capabilities are still developing there is clear evidence that companies with top performance are taking proactive steps to ensure that investments in security and compliance controls directly support the strategic objectives for the business
5968835 by effectively allocating it resources based on business objectives and of risk organizations improve security sustain compliance improve leverage from existing it resources make faster decisions and optimize
5968836 many organizations are leveraging siem solutions to track analyze and manage how the requirements expressed by their policies are being satisfied then they utilize siem results to drive appropriate actions and behavior by the relevant stakeholders users of siem solutions are achieving superior results in security grc as siem provides an active continuous self adjusting link between policy and behavior

5968878 we know from customer feedback that many potential travellers in the gcc have heard great things about royal jet and are extremely keen to use us royal jet has strong ambitions to grow throughout the region and we have therefore decided to level the playing field so that people throughout the gcc can take advantage of our leading product at an extremely competitive price
5968879 we have applied this pricing policy on flights from dubai for some time with dramatic results and so we are now expecting a surge in bookings from across the gcc
5968880 the savings for our clients could well be substantial if a client wanted to fly on one of our boeing business jets from jeddah to geneva for instance it will now cost approximately 20 per cent less than before since the positioning sector will not be included in the calculation of the overall cost
5968881 we are convinced that this will be warmly welcomed by both our existing guests and potential new customers as we increase our presence across the middle east it is yet another example of why royal jet was recently voted the worlds leading private jet charter and business jet provider of the year
5968882 there is a little inflammation which they treated and prescribed rest
5968883 we dont have any long term concerns at the present time
5968884 it started off as a little tendinitis thing and it just exploded
5968885 when you look at the amount of saves weve had and the amount of games weve won
5968886 i dont think it takes a rocket scientist to figure out what a central figure sherrill has been on our ballclub

5968898 while we accept that constraints on runway capacity in the south east will limit the scope for the benefits of competition in the short term we believe separate owners would be more active than baa in exploiting existing opportunities
5968899 in scotland where there are no similar capacity constraints we believe separate owners of edinburgh and glasgow would similarly improve their offerings
5968900 weve got to be realistic its a fundamental challenge to the structure of baa
5968901 ive read enough press and spoken to enough passengers across the country to know that there is a strong demand for change
5968902 to improve the passenger experience we need to get the right capacity in place as soon as possible
5968903 there will be plenty of people lining up to buy those airports feeling they can succeed where baa have failed
5968904 the champions trophy will be held in pakistan and there are no chances of shifting the event from pakistan to any other country
5968905 if the icc shifts the champions trophy to any other venue pakistan will pull out from the event
5968906 the acquisition transaction for 350 000 shares representing 70 per cent form al salams brokerage paid up capital was successfully executed in the egyptian stock exchange in favour of abu dhabi financial services
5968907 the acquisition highlights adfss perseverance and impetus in improving services offered for our clients and it is a first step towards the fulfilment of a wider scope of development including the modernisation of it infrastructure enhancement of human resources and additional regional and international expansion
5968908 we are cautious in our investment plans for pakistan for the time being we are watching the situation emerging out of the resignation very carefully in case it further deteriorate
5968909 we have long term investment interests there as fundamentals are strong and the current situation does not cause any worry
5968910 this is the first time this unique type of protection which completely encloses the shipment has been used for the airfreight of temperature sensitive goods
5968911 it also allows cooling of the shipment during transport and cold storage operations
5968912 firstly there needs to be an institutional and governance framework to ensure smooth transparent and effective decisions on the conduct of monetary policy and other central bank policies including the mode of operation of the gcc central bank inflation should be the priority item on the policy agenda there is need for a change in monetary policy towards inflation targeting with monetary policy geared to maintaining inflation within an announced target range the gcc countries will need to invest in building their statistical capacity in order to provide harmonized comparable economic and financial data to support the gmu and the gulf common market the gmu if it is to be achieved and serve its purpose needs to be supported by investments in financial infrastructure including legal and regulatory payment systems and the development and linkage of money markets and capital markets to ensure a uniform interest rate and the swift transfer of funds throughout the gcc
5968913 the gmu will strengthen the commitment of gcc countries to regional economic integration the gmu should be the central policy anchor extending the benefits of currency stability to financial markets industries and citizens by fostering more intense trade relationships linking the capital markets and attracting international capital
5968914 our aim in the fca is to issue a unified executive list that is binding for the entire uae
5968915 we have discussed this with the saudi authorities it appears that in one of the past few years the total value of goods that entered saudi arabia was sr11 billion dh10 7bn including goods worth sr300 million from the uae
5968916 even if we assume that 50 per cent of uae goods were fake which is impossible they will not exceed 1 5 per cent of the total commodities entering into saudi arabia and this percentage is much less than the globally accepted 10 per cent
5968917 the foundation has established this programme to strengthen the presence of non profit organisations working towards social and educational development in the uae funds can be used for training improved services new programmes project expansion institutional strengthening analysis and other activities that contribute to the effectiveness and sustainability of the organisation
5968918 this programme will allow an important upgrade to the non profit sector in the uae by evaluating future potential and sustainability of the applicants and empowering those organisations that have recognised competency in an area of social or educational development
5968919 organisations with the right expertise can benefit the most from funding in order to improve and expand the work they are doing
5968920 we remain cognisant of the challenges being faced by regional and diaspora investors in getting value for their refund cheques
5968921 teething problems have been noted with this mechanism particularly with regard to exchange rate risk where these investors wish to re invest the refund proceeds in kenya
5968922 in this regard arrangements have been made with the receiving bank for a global refund cheque to be made to brokers with respect to investors residing outside kenya whether in the region or the diaspora who specifically request this facility
5968923 either to purchase securities or for crediting to their clients account
5968924 a lot of mineral water companies are helping us in this initiative

5968926 i dont know if its so much cabrera as it is the philosophy that teams like the red sox have
5968927 they have a distinct approach they work the count theyre not afraid to get deep into the count and theyre not reluctant to hit with two strikes
5968928 the way guys have been swinging the bats especially our top four hitters to come in here and shut us down the way they have over the last two days has been impressive
5968929 my mechanics were really bad for the first two innings
5968930 they started getting better after the third but still no good
5968931 im of the mind that the most important thing for matt is to continue to get as many at bats and as much experience as he can
5968932 i dont see it likely that well bring him up here and have him sit that just doesnt make much sense to me when he comes here he should expect to play
5968933 im actually a pretty patient guy with most aspects of my life baseball is no different
5968934 you definitely learn the business side but at the same time they know the business side better than i do
5968935 theyve been doing it a long time and im sure theyre going to do whats best for the organization and whats best for me right now im a baseball player and just like coming to the park and playing
5968936 is he 100percent ready probably not especially on the defensive end of it hes got a ways to go but hes pretty good hes got a ways to go in terms of game calling how to get hitters out he wouldnt embarrass himself i know that
5968937 i think you definitely have the confidence in yourself if you dont believe you can do it you probably wont be able to do it
5968938 i definitely believe that i could do it right now but at the same time every day you go to the park theres something new to learn no matter what level youre at
5968939 coming from college where youre getting two or three days off a week i think the biggest adjustment is playing 130 out of 140 games thats a big accomplishment your first year

5968965 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
5968966 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed
5968967 patients with a reduction in gsm levels from their baseline ultrasound to the follow up ultrasound exhibited a significantly increased risk for near future adverse event compared to patients with increasing gsm levels

5968974 overall were confident that the full year growth will be faster than the first half even though weve tempered our overall expectations slightly due to the trading conditions in new zealand
5968975 our australian and new zealand businesses differ in the sense that in australia our business is more driven by revenue from support and maintenance contracts and in new zealand relatively more by new unit revenue
5968976 which is really reassuring when looking at the possible impacts of a slowdown on our australian business

5968979 the most fascinating thing about pc gaming is its ability to attract such a diverse audience both demographically and geographically
5968980 this is an industry in an enviable position with a loyal client base regularly topped up by a fresh generation of users with older players failing to desert the sector at the age originally expected around a third of american households have a gaming console which means the industry can still achieve considerable growth spurred on by constantly evolving technology

5968991 i sense that people who use these phones for such purposes dont appreciate the seriousness of the communication
5968992 charges of threatening to kill attract a maximum of seven years imprisonment and it matters little how that threat is communicated its the effect of the threat on the person who receives it
5968993 people who are in the habit of using cellphones and texts to alarm and annoy others need to appreciate that the consequences can be very serious indeed

5969008 him and zaur all the time away from their kids and family it must be hard for them ive no kids and gary keegan hes outside in the crowd he should be in with us but thats for another day i think its a disgrace
5969009 hes a good boxer but i wasnt going to box his fight i closed him down as i was told put my right hand in his face i just felt i was too strong and too fast for him
5969010 just thought to myself id better not get beaten or ill have the wee man giving me stick
5969011 thats why i have the looks i have you know what i mean
5969012 but thats sport for you its a hard game were in especially at this level this is the highest you can get
5969013 it was brilliant to be training with an olympic medalist
5969014 i think i was still in nappies in my sitting room watching carruth on the tv
5969015 when he won that gold medal i said this is it now i went down to the local club in neilstown thats where i met noel
5969016 and it started off from there now im in carruths position this is dreamland
5969017 nothing seems to bother him pressure doesnt seem to get to him before he went out tonight we were laughing and joking in the changing room
5969018 zaur was telling stories from the old soviet bloc it was hilarious
5969019 so paddys a bit different to everybody else ive seen the chinese lad and im not sure how well hes handling the pressure of fighting in front of his own crowd so this is the best place to be
5969020 meet them in their own backyard paddy will fight him in a telephone box if he wants
5969021 itll be just a case of head down arse up and go for it
5969022 from what i see the markets are telling us to prepare for hard times and a global spate of the worst deflation to be seen in generations this is why gold has been sinking this is why stocks have been falling big money sophisticated money is cashing out raising cash preparing for world deflation
5969023 this is probably why lowrys selling pressure stays at its high
5969024 smart money is selling into the stock market day after day theyre raising cash in preparation for the hard times when deflation is in the saddle deflation is ushering in the new strong dollar big money sees deflation and the lower rates that go with deflation look if you have five million dollars and you are only receiving 2 in interest on your money thats only an income of hundred thousand dollars on your five million big money realizes that in a deflation you need a mountain of cash to keep up your lifestyle
5969025 what i see is a coming world deflation and i believe thats the message the markets are sending whats the best stance in a deflationary situation lots of cash and safe solid investments two areas that fit that requirement us dollars and us treasury paper what happens to stocks during deflationary times theyre sold to raise cash what happens to business in deflationary times its crushed by ever lower prices what happens to the average citizen whos loaded with debt during deflationary times theyre battered unmercifully as income buys less and less and as debt crushes them what happens to assets during deflationary times theyre worth less and less and their sale brings in fewer and fewer dollars isnt the price of gold and oil already telling us that

5969034 everyone seems to be piling back into the resource stocks which are up about 3 7 per cent
5969035 it has gained a little bit more than it lost yesterday when it was down 2 7 per cent
5969036 theres an appetite out there to invest somewhere but no one is sure where to invest
5969037 local financial stocks were down in early trade but started to rally towards the end of the day
5969038 guys understand that for the betterment of the game weve got to keep our feelings intact but once you pull on the australian jumper and see the ball you just never know whats going to happen i guess
5969039 thats our game and not part of theirs selwood said
5969040 so its just a sense of obviously pull yourself back at times but when the balls there in your area as competitive as all of us guys are usually we just go 100 per cent and you just see what happens
5969041 none of us go out there to intentionally hurt an irish player its just a contrast in the sports being professional we are a lot stronger than what they are whereas they probably read the game a lot better
5969042 when you pull on that australian jumper its a weird sort of feeling you sort of get that sense of playing for your country and youve got the whole country looking at you so it is pretty fiery crowley said
5969043 i think in the last series the irish gave as good as they got but i suppose with all the press that came along with what happened with the last series we might have to tone it down a little bit
5969044 if you are going to step over the mark youve got to pay the consequences crowley said

5969047 so i thought it was beautiful the other day when obama went to
5969048 i made it i finally won a gold medal i cant stop smiling im so excited
5969049 but i go by everything happens for a reason and for some reason the judges were giving me scores im not used to but they had a reason
5969050 it did upset me a little but i thought about it and i decided i was at the olympic games i was having the time of my life and im winning medals
5969051 when you do get silver you feel different emotions but i looked back and appreciated that i had a medal
5969052 if it were gold it might feel differently i dont know how to explain it i definitely came to appreciate it i wouldnt trade my silver medals for anything in the world not even gold
5969053 the more mistakes you make in practice the more you worry

5969065 we have to stop people from taking the road to militancy the biggest flaw with musharrafs policy was that he had placed too much emphasis on the military strategy alone how can you win against your own people and that too when they are opposed to you so strongly
5969066 for pakistan the main risk is if casualties continue to rise in afghanistan you would have mounting pressure on the americans to retaliate in the border areas pakistan might as well take charge of the area even if thats difficult right now at least if your people feel you are trying to protect them they may not be so disillusioned
5969067 reorienting the war on terror was necessary for the army as well the army has fought in the border area for six years and they havent been able to curb the militants maybe it is time to win hearts and minds of local people and make them your allies

5969076 it was dreadful really dreadful one minute they were all laughing and squirting each other with water pistols it was a long straight stretch of road and the tractor had broken down at the side

5969116 we feel the deterrent effect plays a part in what we see athletes know that at this event the ioc which is the organisation running the doping programmes means business when it comes to not having those who cheat be part of this event
5969117 we will take a further appraisal once the games are completed its not over yet but thats really how we see things at this stage
5969118 we are not privy to that information in terms of those sample collections the medical authorities are doing some 300 or so samples a day up to 350 at their maximum limit

5969198 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5969199 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5969200 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
5969201 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralizes their potential benefits
5969202 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolizing enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs
5969203 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way

5969207 we are very clear if you engage in illegal activity on our site we absolutely will share information with law enforcement we provide testimony in court
5969208 and what this person was proposing was probably not so feasible unrealistic
5969209 i dont think it will happen more and more as the elections are approaching
5969210 its not anything thats widespread or cause for concern in any way
5969211 people are just looking for an audience they are really using that listing as an opportunity to put their opinion on there
5969212 we have had instances that would be similar in nature where we have sports fan who are really unhappy with the performance of their favorite team and they may try to list the coach for sale as a way to express their unhappiness with the performance of their team
5969213 the competition commission has provisionally found that there are competition problems at each of baas seven uk airports heathrow gatwick stansted and southampton in england and edinburgh glasgow and aberdeen in scotland with adverse consequences for passengers and airlines
5969214 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5969215 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold
5969216 the move will better protect the interests of the olympic gold medalists
5969217 were advised to give it to the medalist as a gift
5969218 everyone knows what happened a couple of weeks ago and our forms turned around since then
5969219 weve got a pretty young group and all the young kids have got a lot of confidence at the moment
5969220 so the coaches will try to bring that into the game and let the boys play the way they play and use their confidence and a bit of flair to hopefully get us over the line
5969221 weve just got to stick to our structures we do match up pretty well against sydney
5969222 hopefully we just keep doing the things weve been doing and things will hopefully fall our way
5969223 hes served his two weeks and he trained pretty strongly today
5969224 obviously hes a great runner hes one of those players that breaks the lines for us so im assuming hes available for selection
5969225 im very good mates with al so obviously i want him to stay id love him to play at collingwood for the rest of his career
5969226 going out to kids schools and the stuff he does off his own bat and helping out his mates kids and that sort of stuff you never hear about that
5969227 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production
5969228 this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5969229 i dont think any decision is going to be made but i wont be surprised at the rhetoric and traders are looking at it
5969230 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5969231 the government has always had confidence that our plan to secure the states future energy needs represents the best result for the economy taxpayers and the environment
5969232 the owen report the unsworth review and the rural community impact statement have all endorsed the governments strategy
5969233 its release will also set a test for barry ofarrell who has dithered and delayed and hinged his decision on the recommendations of the report
5969234 to be joining the dragons next year will be great for my career and to be playing for such a proud club with so much history and tradition is something to which im looking forward
5969235 darius will join the dragons at a very good stage of his career
5969236 this is an interesting discovery and a lot more important for us because he was dressed in full kit
5969237 we actually find out a lot more about the australians during the first world war by finding bodies such as this one
5969238 the most likely scenario from what we can tell at this stage is that he was part of the attack on messines ridge
5969239 then they were pushing on to further objectives when he was hit and fell and was then covered over by a shell blast or buried in some way and that is where he has lain for 91 years
5969240 we definitely know he wasnt buried by his mates because he was in full battle kit he was still holding his rifle when they uncovered him he had his backpack on he had hand grenades in his pockets and he had all his ammunition and his helmet
5969241 it is a very positive start to the id process
5969242 magic montys spicy spinners is slightly spicy and full of flavour
5969243 sie erlaubt die verwendung nicht nur bei straftaten sondern auch bei tatbest nden der sogenannten polizeilichen gefahrenabwehr beispielsweise im vorfeld von ereignissen wie dem g8 gipfel au erdem haben neben der polizei auch alle nachrichtendienste zugriff auf die gespeicherten verbindungsdaten
5969244 overall were confident that the full year growth will be faster than the first half even though weve tempered our overall expectations slightly due to the trading conditions in new zealand
5969245 our australian and new zealand businesses differ in the sense that in australia our business is more driven by revenue from support and maintenance contracts and in new zealand relatively more by new unit revenue
5969246 which is really reassuring when looking at the possible impacts of a slowdown on our australian business
5969247 refreshingly light in colour with a citrus fruity aroma and finish which combines the refreshing qualities of a lager with the artisan complexity of a fine ale
5969248 when do i buzz it all off the downside to all this hair is that there is so much more to fall out and get everywhere
5969249 the woman at the salon where i bought a wig last week said i would know the right time and im still not ready yet
5969250 its definitely not hurting these folks its a good means to express yourself
5969251 these folks will look back over the last few years and say look at what ive come through
5969252 theres a very empowering process that goes on when cancer becomes something you can write about its not just this thing thats invaded you
5969253 the danger to the individual i suppose is that some people could expose themselves more than they maybe want to
5969254 but i think the danger is more in the potential misinformation
5969255 it really causes you in the midst of having the rug pulled out from under you to think about what you want to say and what you want people to hear
5969256 the first version was probably my own cathartic dumping out of all my own feelings
5969257 and i remember realizing i could edit it a little bit and still get out some of those feelings without overwhelming people but also letting people know it was really tough
5969258 its been great for me because when youre sick its tough to reach out to your friends individually
5969259 with this you write one message and people respond with all these really beautiful things its really uplifting
5969260 when you get cancer youve descended into a foreign country where you dont know the language and you dont know how to get around
5969261 and one of the ways you learn to do that is being able to talk to people who are members of this world
5969262 after a while you become more interested in the experience of the cancer than in the science of the cancer
5969263 you start to move past what the disease is and you start to wonder what the disease will be like
5969264 in case there were others out there who wanted to know about the experience of cancer
5969265 i realized about four or five months into it that i had become part of this greater blogging community
5969266 its not that im stuck in the past and im not willing to move on
5969267 ive just come to accept that breast cancer in some way shape or form will always be a part of my everyday life
5969268 is it right for a rookie to room with such an old veteran
5969269 get left go fast and push everyone out of your way
5969270 i have never seen anyone have so many people around their cruiser night after night like you
5969271 moscow must honor its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory

5969275 odds are its not going to be as low as was forecasted back in february and that will certainly affect revenue
5969276 high gas and oil prices just drain peoples income away
5969277 i really do think that this budget cycle will be more difficult than the last
5969278 weve gotten to the point where there are no easy choices
5969279 you cant beat them at everything but you try to stay close if we didnt wed be out of business
5969280 our elements will put down their arms we believe libya can solve the rebellion problems of niger and mali
5969281 und als sarah dann angefangen hat war das f r mich total klar dass ich das auch unbedingt machen m chte
5969282 es ist etwas das sich anbietet aus sicht des j ngeren nach dem motto wenn die das geschafft hat schaffe ich das auch
5969283 auch rein technisch durch die lteren geschwister eher den zugang zu diesem bereich finden
5969284 ich w re gern wie britney vielleicht besser aber ich m chte sie auch nicht berragen
5969285 ich bin damit aufgewachsen lindsay zuzusehen ich will das machen was sie macht
5969286 f r gleichgeschlechtliche beziehungen mit einem geringen altersunterschied nach au en kommt die konkurrenz aber nicht zum vorschein da stehen die geschwister meist zusammen
5969287 ich m chte jetzt nicht irgendwie floppen das w re schon ziemlich schlimm
5969288 i took it home and learned how to play on one string when the saints go marching in the other strings didnt make a difference then i accidentally tuned it the way im tuning it now i say im playing it backwards i dont play like the average guitar player the cats who move their fingers all around like this i do it in chords and basically do almost the same thing
5969289 every public school needs effective methods of discipline but beating kids teaches violence and it doesnt stop bad behavior
5969290 corporal punishment discourages learning fails to deter future misbehavior and at times even provokes it
5969291 when you talk to local school officials they point to the fact that its quick and its effective and thats true
5969292 it doesnt take much time to administer corporal punishment and you dont have to hire someone to run a detention or an after school program
5969293 we need forms of discipline that makes children understand why what they did was wrong
5969294 teachers may have overcrowded classrooms and lack resources such as counselors to assist with particularly disruptive students or classroom dynamics
5969295 corporal punishment is not effective at the junior and senior high school levels and i do not recommend its application
5969296 it can be useful for elementary students especially with amateur clowns as opposed to hard core troublemakers for this reason i am opposed to abolishing spanking in elementary schools because we have systematically eliminated the tools with which teachers have traditionally backed up their word were now down to a precious few lets not go any further in that direction
5969297 most parents like this because it takes care of the punishment it gets the kids back in class it doesnt disrupt instruction its like the quick and dirty way of dealing with discipline problems
5969298 it works on some and it doesnt work on others
5969299 if youre one of the individuals that it does work on yes it will become a deterrent
5969300 i dont think its the schools place to make decisions like that
5969301 im not necessarily in favor of that kind of punishment in the house either but i feel like if somebody makes that decision it should be the parent
5969302 we just believe that its time for us to look at other options for our kids as opposed to corporal punishment
5969303 we think theres more effective ways most of our principals have chosen not to use it even though its been in the book were trying to create some consistency
5969304 i missed two balls tonight and thats unacceptable catching a routine fly ball should not be that much of a problem im baffled i flat out just dropped two balls
5969305 i think its two balls im going to say 999 times out of 1 000 maybe more he catches both of them
5969306 if this teams going to use me in center more then i need to be better thats very uncharacteristic of me and of most centerfielders
5969307 he made a great play barehanded and threw a strike to second
5969308 you have to make sure youre safe its a hell of a play by overbay and hes probably one of the better defenders but you have to make sure youre safe
5969309 when we unwrapped the baby to see her she realized it was moving i began screaming and ran with it toward the doctors
5969310 in medicine when we see something like this we call it a medical miracle but at this point we do not have an explanation

5969312 honey has anyone ever told you how handsome sexy and irresistible to women you are
5969313 then what the heck gave you that idea at the party tonight
5969314 i hope it gives people comfort that they can do security research without fear that theyre going to be dragged into federal court and gagged
5969315 we didnt do any proven attack on the charliecard but there are definitely issues present
5969316 the materials that weve gotten from the students so far dont show theyve been able to compromise the charliecard
5969317 my invitation to the students to sit down with us and discuss their findings a great opportunity now presents itself
5969318 it was not a flaw with the ticket or the system
5969319 someone has worked toward figuring out the combination to the padlock we are changing the combination and adding more security enhancements
5969320 it was not until just this morning that the mbta admitted what the students were doing isnt a prank
5969321 if theres ever been a shoot the messenger case i guess this is it
5969322 this is a public debate on a matter of public importance and they want to participate
5969323 weve always maintained that there are certain details that we didnt want to disclose because we dont want people defrauding the mbta
5969324 we have two options we can tax tourists or we can tax residents in your districts
5969325 if it has the impact of shutting down hotels which no one wants
5969326 by combining the complementary strengths and product offerings of ericsson and st in platforms and semiconductors the joint venture is well positioned to become a world leader
5969327 i am amazed at the level of arrogance by the prosecution and so is the kovacevic family that they condemn miladin before his guilt is proven
5969328 it proved miladin would not receive a fair trial in america and that he was right to have avoided facing the indictment there
5969329 you are not disabled mentally it happens you have to carry on she carried on where she left off
5969330 for me the olympics is a dream come true there were people who said it is not possible but you dont have to be the best to get gold
5969331 there is no difference now in the first races they would always let me lead and then swim past me in the end it is like the paralympics we are all good friends
5969332 it would be great if she would get a separate gold medal
5969333 an inspiration that you can do whatever you want to do and compatriot bronze medallist cassandra patten named her
5969334 i find it open water swimming hard as an able bodied athlete
5969335 i want to race against able bodied athletes i dont want anything free
5969336 i never worked out how much it the missing leg is a handicap i just get in the water and swim i get in the water and switch off i am completely free in the water
5969337 i will stay focused and try my best at the paralympics
5969338 my decision remains firm france is committed to continue the fight against terrorism for democracy and freedom the issue is just
5969339 it would be great if she would get a separate gold medal hopefully she will win one day
5969340 i want to race against able bodied athletes i dont want anything free
5969341 i find it very hard as an able bodies athlete she is an amazing role model i have utmost respect for her
5969342 an inspiration that you can do whatever you want to do
5969343 i am not a campaigner i am just realizing my personal dream
5969344 prevenir colectivamente las enfermedades y es m s eficiente efectivo y responsable que curar las afecciones de la poblaci n
5969345 make money they raise money they write books and do other kinds of things like volunteer their time
5969346 talk about their experience and use their position to tell the next president and the government how to make it a better world
5969347 we fully intend to comply with the process and make sure they get all the information they need
5969348 i sent money to a trust account to davids solicitor david mcleod in adelaide
5969349 i think it must have got up to about 50 000
5969350 it was to support family members to visit david and for other purposes
5969351 the money also funded geoffrey robertson the top international human rights lawyer to travel to washington
5969352 none of it went to david hicks not a cent
5969353 when david hicks finally came back to australia a cheque arrived from david mcleod for the money that hadnt been used i thought that was incredibly ethical
5969354 even if you are the worst rapist in the world you get a proper trial in this country
5969355 i was horrified that people would not allow that for david hicks
5969356 even former prime minister john howard who i respect and is a good friend of mine had made up his mind that david hicks was a bad person
5969357 i wanted to get david in front of a jury and i feel short changed because that never happened

5969362 we make every attempt to limit our techniques to those proved through generations of traditional winemaking
5969363 im on pins and needles at the moment this is the time of year when we are starting to see the color of the grapes begin to change that is an event which starts the countdown to harvest another critical time this is the last month of ripening and it is the time where the real character of the wine will be determined decisions made in the vineyard now will really affect the outcome and quality of the wine
5969364 i would usually see a 3 ton yield from one of my one acre blocks this harvest i will probably only get about a half ton

5969371 a principal cause is their common ownership by baa there are also competition problems arising from the planning system aspects of government policy and the system of regulation
5969372 the cc is now seeking views on which two of baas three london airports should be sold and similarly which of edinburgh or glasgow airports should be sold
5969373 five villages have been flooded and the residents have been evacuated
5969374 we think people may have been killed but we have not been able to verify the number
5969375 the government has always had confidence that our plan to secure the states future energy needs represents the best result for the economy taxpayers and the environment
5969376 the owen report the unsworth review and the rural community impact statement have all endorsed the governments strategy
5969377 its release will also set a test for barry ofarrell who has dithered and delayed and hinged his decision on the recommendations of the report
5969378 everyone knows what happened a couple of weeks ago and our forms turned around since then
5969379 weve got a pretty young group and all the young kids have got a lot of confidence at the moment
5969380 so the coaches will try to bring that into the game and let the boys play the way they play and use their confidence and a bit of flair to hopefully get us over the line

5969385 im very good mates with al so obviously i want him to stay id love him to play at collingwood for the rest of his career
5969386 going out to kids schools and the stuff he does off his own bat and helping out his mates kids and that sort of stuff you never hear about that
5969387 off the field hes such a character hes a ripping bloke he just made a couple of silly decisions and hes been crucified for it
5969388 to be joining the dragons next year will be great for my career and to be playing for such a proud club with so much history and tradition is something to which im looking forward
5969389 darius will join the dragons at a very good stage of his career
5969390 he was good enough to play state of origin this year and is a quality nrl player that we are excited about having at the dragons
5969391 the move will better protect the interests of the olympic gold medalists
5969392 were advised to give it to the medalist as a gift
5969393 over the years every time there is a major election we have had people attempt to put up a listing we catch them very quickly
5969394 when we see these listings we definitely take them down
5969395 its possible that someone would put a listing up its possible to be up for a couple of hours before we catch it its possible that for a brief period of time something might actually be visible on the site
5969396 we are very clear if you engage in illegal activity on our site we absolutely will share information with law enforcement we provide testimony in court
5969397 and what this person was proposing was probably not so feasible unrealistic
5969398 i dont think it will happen more and more as the elections are approaching
5969399 its not anything thats widespread or cause for concern in any way
5969400 people are just looking for an audience they are really using that listing as an opportunity to put their opinion on there
5969401 we have had instances that would be similar in nature where we have sports fan who are really unhappy with the performance of their favorite team and they may try to list the coach for sale as a way to express their unhappiness with the performance of their team
5969402 this is an interesting discovery and a lot more important for us because he was dressed in full kit
5969403 we actually find out a lot more about the australians during the first world war by finding bodies such as this one
5969404 the most likely scenario from what we can tell at this stage is that he was part of the attack on messines ridge
5969405 then they were pushing on to further objectives when he was hit and fell and was then covered over by a shell blast or buried in some way and that is where he has lain for 91 years
5969406 we definitely know he wasnt buried by his mates because he was in full battle kit he was still holding his rifle when they uncovered him he had his backpack on he had hand grenades in his pockets and he had all his ammunition and his helmet
5969407 it is a very positive start to the id process
5969408 the belgian war graves currently have custody of the body the australian army will then be in charge of the investigation to try and identify him
5969409 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production
5969410 this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5969411 i dont think any decision is going to be made but i wont be surprised at the rhetoric and traders are looking at it
5969412 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5969413 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
5969414 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
5969415 a key drug uptake transporter called oatp1a2 involved in shuttling drugs from the small intestine to the bloodstream
5969416 blocking this transporter reduces drug absorption and neutralizes their potential benefits
5969417 by contrast drugs whose levels are boosted in the presence of grapefruit juice appear to block an important drug metabolizing enzyme called cyp3a4 that normally breaks down drugs
5969418 im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
5969419 det bara finns en v g till gud genom jesus kristus
5969420 there is a reasonable chance that we will see something in the next congress

5969422 renters insurance is covering your contents since you dont own the building that youre staying in thats all youre going to cover is just what you own homeowners insurance you own the building and everything in it so a homeowners insurance will cover that structure as well as all of the contents in it
5969423 now youre excited about all the stuff thats going to lie ahead maybe thats the most fun
5969424 now there is a future as opposed to wondering whether its ever going to happen
5969425 when i found out he was going to be our offensive coordinator i was a little shocked
5969426 hes such a big name and theres a lot of hype around him
5969427 i guess the biggest noticeable influence is that every quarterback in the country calls us wanting to see if they can come theres a great allure to norm chow
5969428 as an entire defense i think were going to shock the country
5969429 theyre that elephant in the living room you cant be the head football coach at ucla and not find a way to compete successfully with usc

5969440 its been an emotional rollercoaster you try to shut out a lot of things and just try to focus on the sport
5969441 i give a lot credit to my partner cheryl shes put up with a lot of crap this year
5969442 its just good to get this out of the way now i can relax and live a normal life and stop making sacrifices
5969443 the stress was all about the uncontrollables there are random drivers in auckland who want to take you down
5969444 anything can happen and it can just destroy your career its been a stressful year worrying about all that sort of stuff
5969445 im just going to keep on going i want to get the full collection now
5969446 it would have been good to get the ultimate gold this time round but at least it keeps me hungry being a couple of steps behind again
5969447 on the circuit i get called mr consistency my coach and i have definitely got the right formula
5969448 for an old guy i can still hang in there and make a good living from the sport its all about achieving your goals
5969449 if i was the neighbor right next to that id want as much barrier as i could have
5969450 gt authenticity fueling chinese nationalism for china the big question in the post olympic decade will be if they can hold the gigantic country together while probably having to learn to deal with hyper growth at least one financial crisis and continuous democratization chinese style
5969451 its a hipocracy talking about the closed nature of a country like china and in the same breath complaining about the fact that intellectual properties are being violated in china
5969452 defensively we still have to improve but thats normal when you only have one day of preparation
5969453 not at all you have the organisation that was not good yet but we had one training session
5969454 we have 10 days to work before uzbekistan and thats what we have to improve definitely
5969455 the movement was excellent and overall some of the boys look really sharp
5969456 the way we try to play when weve got the ball means if we lose it were quite spread out and we have to get back into position as quickly as possible or we leave ourselves vulnerable
5969457 me and scotty do alright together i think with more time on the pitch together it will get even better
5969458 marks definitely a quality player i look up to him and can still learn a lot from him
5969459 i know what they can do and what they cant
5969460 i will wait until training camp when i have everyone in the group then i can make my mind up

5969473 were playing for everyone involved in the club the playing staff coaching staff and mainly our loyal supporters who continue to turn up each week
5969474 it doesnt matter where we play last week it was freezing out at penrith and our fans were still there so hopefully we can give them a win
5969475 for us weve just moved on from it a few weeks ago so we just want to train and do our thing and thats all well worry about
5969476 obviously the guys coming in theres some great signings there and weve got a lot of young kids coming in as well who are outstanding talents and weve seen a few of them in first grade this year
5969477 the futures looking good but for us the playing group and the coach we want to finish 2008 on a good note
5969478 certainly theres not many players available now and theres certainly no other sonny bill williams floating around
5969479 and that day will two monsters be parted one monster a female named leviathan in order to dwell in the abyss of the ocean over the fountains of water and the other a male called p emerson williams which holds his chest in an invisible desert whose name is dunfoamin east of the garden of eden
5969480 reading between the lines of the search warrant hes their primary suspect
5969481 sometimes circumstantial evidence can be more powerful than direct evidence
5969482 our society cries out for justice and unfortunately our society always wants everything now
5969483 it takes a lot of pieces if you will to be able to weave together a story that will convince a jury
5969484 everyday that goes by without an arrest is a day too long
5969485 but im not a detective theyre putting a puzzle together when the time is right an arrest will be made
5969486 at this point in time there is no discussion about a late move
5969487 as far as we are concerned the tournament continues in pakistan
5969488 we are probably at a position where it is not possible to have a world class event elsewhere the shorter time frame the less likely that is of happening
5969489 i think the time for switching to another host country has passed
5969490 its a complicated legal process its something i would not be able to tell you at this point
5969491 if not it will come down to a decision from the players
5969492 our position is that we cant recommend that our players should tour pakistan
5969493 inget resultat som du ser varje dag n r vi spelar
5969494 we were pretty ticked off to say the least the reason he got paddled was because he was untying his shoes and playing with the air conditioner thermostat
5969495 one of the things weve seen over and over again is that parents have difficulty getting redress if a child is paddled and severely injured or paddled in violation of parents wishes
5969496 international human rights law puts a pretty strong prohibition on corporal punishment
5969497 i didnt get any bruises but they still hurt and from that point on i told myself and my parents i wasnt going to take any more paddlings
5969498 just about everyone at the beginning of the year said if he or she gives you any trouble you can paddle them you can send them home and ill paddle them or you can have me come out to the school and we can both paddle them
5969499 its really just a part of the culture of the school environment there
5969500 the use of corporal punishment is associated almost overwhelmingly with negative effects and that it increases childrens problem behavior over time
5969501 we teach our children that violence is wrong yet corporal punishment teaches children that violence is a way to solve problems
5969502 it perpetuates a cycle of child abuse it teaches children to hit someone smaller and weaker when angry

5969507 this set was built exactly 20 minutes before i walked on to it to shoot
5969508 they were nailing the floorboards down and i came in and the beds themselves the inside was all stone theyd discussed slate which i thought they meant was a color it was not supposed to be a coffin and i freaked out
5969509 they are supposed to feel a little bit like coffins but when they were stone they felt like not just dracula but like louis jourdan

5969511 a completely organic experience from the lunch i had with eliza which is something ive done a few times with her to going home and my wife saying yeah it sounds like the next thing just because you can tell

5969513 we are kind of living in a fish bowl a little bit
5969514 sometimes i dont like people to see the man behind the curtain i dont like them to know that something wasnt awesome before they saw it
5969515 you know the things we had to tweak the things we had to cut that is inevitable
5969516 but now i dont think it is just us the whole world is so much about seeing behind the curtain and seeing how things are made and how they work and the extended cut and what we could have done and what we didnt do and the alternate ending and you just you kind of take it as part and parcel at the beginning

5969534 we did it so much at practice checking the ball down that its better than the deep ball sometimes
5969535 letting the backs break a few tackles get a first down or a big run isnt bad we kind of forced that in my head and im just kind of living by that right now
5969536 hes bought in and he understands why were doing it
5969537 when it was there he took it and when it wasnt he checked the ball down the more he does the more well be able to play like that
5969538 im here to do whatever it takes to help the team out whether it is to throw the ball five times a game with the backs we have and the way the offensive line has a good run blocking game
5969539 it doesnt mean anything to me unless i can go out there and help out to win the game im ok with that
5969540 the debt restructuring based on twice the market price will significantly improve our balance sheet increase our shareholders equity improve our position as a much stronger competitor in the industry and provide a strong base to build upon with the anticipated closing of the merger with jazz technologies israel corporation under the leadership of its chairman idan ofer continued to show its strong belief in tower as well as in our dedicated and professional employees and in the companys strategy and growth prospects through its additional investment in tower and in having been the catalyst for the bank debt restructure the resulting capital structure will serve as an excellent springboard into the future

5969545 over the past few years tower has substantially improved its revenue and operational results as evidenced by becoming the number one revenue growth foundry for 2007 over 2005 todays announcement of a memorandum of understanding signed with our banks and israel corporation provides a much stronger corporate capital structure from which we can continue this momentum we expect that these financial improvements combined with the expected closing of the jazz merger will maintain our growth trajectory while substantially improving ebitda and cash generation in the course of transitioning into the worldwide leading specialty foundry
5969546 the response from both the jazz and tower customers with regard to the combined product platform offerings and roadmaps has been overwhelmingly positive and we have begun to leverage the cross selling opportunities through joint meetings with customers of both companies integration efforts are well underway in anticipation of the completion of the transaction by the end of this quarter we have established an inter company cross functional team tasked with ensuring a seamless transition and we expect to realize approximately 40 million in annual cost savings from the jazz merger

5969566 the information you are prepared to validate through publication is years if not a decade out of date
5969567 if you visit our campus you can quickly see for yourself the report is false
5969568 a significant investment in campus security to ensure the safety of students faculty staff and visitors
5969569 spreading demonstrably false reports under the guise of calling it gossip is something we hope the daily news will not assist more than that radar is not a magazine deserving of the daily news attention
5969570 initially in 2000 we had one extra guitarist called bob we began learning our instruments together and playing for fun in matts cellar we played a few small gigs like this either organised by ourselves or at our high school in 2001 we became a three piece bob was more into heavy metal the following year we won a competition to play at newcastle city hall with yfriday which was massive for us
5969571 people started calling us the steels and it just stuck we learnt new songs and developed our sound we began doing bigger gigs especially supporting yfriday and titus a lot more obviously we were still at school so had a lot of time constraints we gradually started recording songs with dez and gav from yfriday in any free time we had dez took up a manager role with the band booking us gigs etc
5969572 we all began uni in september we all ended up going to leeds uni even though it was not all our first choice we launched the album at christmas the new album led to bigger gigs including travelling abroad to sweden we also started to headline more concerts rather than playing support we also began playing bigger festivals like greenbelt grapevine merseyfest etc in the summer of 2007 we recorded our second album your name in lights over two to three months we released the album at christmas with a launch tour around uk
5969573 we used live drums unlike on the first album which improved the overall sound massively
5969574 the band has got to the point where we have taken it as far as we can with other commitments it seems like the right time to make the change to full time and hopefully being able to put all our time into it will make it a success we feel our main aim as a band is to change the stereotypical image many non christians have of christianity and show them its cool and relevant in their lives for this reason we felt it was important to have a few songs on this album that everyone could relate to everyday issues to show we were normal basically once people get into these songs they will then start listening to the others and realise there is something far more important about our music waiting and masquerade were the two songs which did this job waiting is about being away from someone you care a lot about and missing them masquerade is about encouraging and supporting each other and being honest and open its amazing how a little encouragement can change someone and fill them with confidence also saying how you really feel before its too late
5969575 so many times we have felt things were going badly when actually we have been making a real impact in other ways maybe by just being there and talking to people with god we can achieve so much more so many times we have felt things were not possible but it is so easy to think within our own constraints and not gods for example last summer in hastings we had to organise an outdoor town centre gig in two days it seemed impossible but with gods help it just happened and hundreds of people emptied out the pubs and clubs to jump around to christian music it was unbelievable and completely god
5969576 im going to have cute boobs til im 90 so theres that
5969577 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5969578 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5969579 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
5969580 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really like you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes
5969581 and i think thats its all part of healing and anyone whos going through it out there its ok to cry its ok to fall on the ground and just scream if you want to
5969582 i love living and i really love my life and i knew that from this moment on it was only going to be good that was going to be coming
5969583 yeah ill face challenges but you cant get any darker than where ive been
5969584 this storm is going to be with us for a while thats obvious now it looks like it could be a boomerang storm
5969585 its very seldom were hoping for a hurricane but we are
5969586 i know people hate drought but when youre talking about a tropical cyclone relieving drought conditions be careful what you wish for
5969587 our biggest concern is complacency jacksonville has a history of being shielded from storm systems while we dont want anyone to panic we want everyone in the area to take this storm seriously
5969588 i just came in from the fields everything is burning up
5969589 if a storm is brewing down there just send it up i 26
5969590 it is not a problem related to ethnicity or religion
5969591 we can see from examples of closures of several mosques over the recent years very strict control over religion and also arrests of activists as well as people accused of violent offenses
5969592 usually if a uighur gets in trouble the police come and detain everyone in his family then they lose their jobs and have trouble getting new ones
5969593 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not at all respected by chinese officials inside tibet
5969594 there are restrictions on the circulation of information a very strong censorship and often civilians are arrested and tortured very violently to the point where they die
5969595 the chinese response is that if you put aside this nonsense we will make you wealthy
5969596 it is better to deal with the government than make it your enemy
5969597 sometimes the government calls me a rebel and sometimes the rebels say i am with the government
5969598 the more the rebels failed their people the more the tribal leaders will assert their authority

5969619 we actually find out a lot more about the australians during the first world war by finding bodies such as this one
5969620 the most likely scenario from what we can tell at this stage is that he was part of the attack on messines ridge
5969621 then they were pushing on to further objectives when he was hit and fell and was then covered over by a shell blast or buried in some way and that is where he has lain for 91 years
5969622 we definitely know he wasnt buried by his mates because he was in full battle kit he was still holding his rifle when they uncovered him he had his backpack on he had hand grenades in his pockets and he had all his ammunition and his helmet
5969623 it is a very positive start to the id process
5969624 talk of reconciliation might mean that some people still have unextinguishable anger at others in their minds but by recognizing that inner anger and objectifying it we are led to true reconciliation

5969631 thank god for the truth and for the blood of jesus christ which takes our sins away
5969632 in luke 15 11 27 jesus told the story of the prodigal son who had left his fathers home taking his inheritance with him
5969633 in other words the son foolishly wasted his money on wine women and song etc

5969635 to turn upon a thing to have a desire for
5969636 in the case of the prodigal son it was garbage instead of gravel
5969637 in proverb 20 17 is referring to a person being buried and dirt being thrown down into the grave
5969638 we are living in times of great apostasy when most churches are following the world and fewer lost sinners are truly finding salvation in christ jesus
5969639 a christian cannot be right with god and wrong with man i
5969640 many people need to come to themselves in this matter of justice and reconciliation for they are living in sin by refusing to right their wrongs against others
5969641 god does not require anything from us to be saved just that we believe upon jesus christ who justifies the ungodly with his shed blood 1st peter 1 18 19 therefore catholicism is a lie islam is a lie the

5969645 god has put each part just where he wants it
5969646 why do they need me theres plenty of people to help out
5969647 initially the head monk of one of the villages we visited was confused because of our name and the fact that his village was made up mostly of buddhists he became really overjoyed when i told him that we help all people that are in need regardless of faith he just had this great big smile and kept saying that he was overjoyed that people from a different faith were helping him and his people

5969656 so all participants of the 2008 transalpine run have to face a route which is 60 kilometres longer and has 500 metres of elevation gain more than the last years
5969657 both recommend transalpine run newbies to enter the race for the first time on the old route from oberstdorf to latsch due to this years rough profile in 2009 when the gore tex transalpine run turns five the old route will be set again
5969658 sex involving an adult and a young person under 16 would remain strictly illegal and would be prosecuted
5969659 the issue here is consensual sex involving two youngsters under 16
5969660 there might be some circumstances where you would want to mark that this was a gross breach by one child of another childs rights and safety
5969661 but mostly under age sex is between consenting young people who have probably not been properly guided and have not been given proper adult supervision and support who are in need of care and welfare rather than prosecution
5969662 often parents abdicate their responsibility and leave it up to schools health professionals and others
5969663 perhaps as a society we need to help parents more to have the tools to have these discussions with their children

5969666 this is a consultation and we welcome ideas about the proposals
5969667 we would welcome the general principle that more coursework be assessed as part of the overall examination system
5969668 the difficulty we have is that if the work that is done is a kind of project based work where much of it is being done outside of the school then there is a potential difficulty in verifying that the work is in fact that of the pupils themselves
5969669 we would prefer to see any internal assessment being done literally inside the school so that the work is being verified by teachers and they can attest to the fact it is the work of the pupils
5969670 there are a range of assessment techniques which can be used to make that happen
5969671 the consultation paper clearly states that external exams will be retained at all levels where they are currently used for certification
5969672 however we believe that there may be scope for making better use of different types of assessment alongside external exams depending upon the individual nature of each course
5969673 we do not believe it is right that any chances should be taken with the health and safety of these workers
5969674 police in foyle remain committed to tackling crime including that of a sectarian nature
5969675 we have a strategy in place to deal with incidents at interface areas and this has generally proved successful
5969676 police will continue to work with the community to address these issues and will actively follow up on any information passed to us by the public

5969701 its a great feeling knowing youre moving on in the little league world series its a dream come true
5969702 i was just ecstatic going on walk off at the little league world series its something ill remember the rest of my life
5969703 i was thinking i have to shorten up my swing because i have two strikes and i just wanted to pump the team up
5969704 but i was always skiing by myself and always felt a little scared
5969705 and once i thought for sure i saw bear tracks and i thought oh god i might get eaten alive out here and no ones going to know where i am
5969706 and because of how ugly the uglies got my family asked me not to do it i was bitter i was stressed out i was pushing myself so hard i was pushing to exhaustion
5969707 its been a whole new world and its been beautiful to learn about these skill sports
5969708 that was one of the paradigms i was trying to break with this goal can you learn a sport in less than 10 years
5969709 if you are an experienced athlete who trains four hours a day six days a week and focuses every minute on your technique does it still take you 10 years like coaches say it does i didnt know if i could do it even on friday im not sure im going to show that i accomplished that
5969710 it might take a couple of pulls to get me started
5969711 but once i get started im pretty good ill cut the grass as good as any mower out there
5969712 all of this was going on while i was trying to learn the techniques of fencing
5969713 i used to love to be around people but i found myself keeping to myself a lot more i didnt trust people much mostly i was upset with the way the case was handled by the police
5969714 they kept telling me they had to wait until they had a better case and i kept telling them lets not wait until its too good a case i just wondered why they couldnt do their job
5969715 i over analyze things i have too high expectations for myself its weird because i do believe we were put on this earth to enjoy our lives and there is this side of me that wants to get on with my life and just relax and enjoy
5969716 sams family is jewish lindsay has learned a lot about judaism from sam and admires its beliefs
5969717 i doubt it two years ago it was kabbalah last year it was aa she was into peace for a while whatever is of the moment thats lindsay but the one thing it does show is her commitment to sam she could be any religion and lindsay would be open to it
5969718 i look forward to returning to seattle after my surgery to cheer on the storm
5969719 im disappointed that i wont be able to finish out the regular season but i have confidence in my teammates im hopeful that i can rejoin them for the wnba finals
5969720 shes had some issues all through the season and sat out some games during the preliminary tournament
5969721 i remember seeing nastia have hers from the all around and it is so pretty silver is really pretty too
5969722 the thing i really am pleased with is she was a little under the weather and she still was able to do a wonderful routine
5969723 this was the right ending to conclude the olympic games
5969724 through history slovenia has come under the rule of the roman empire the byzantine empire the republic of venice the duchy of carantania the holy roman empire the habsburg monarchy the austrian empire the state of slovenes croats and serbs the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes germans and italians during world war ii and the socialist federal republic of yugoslavia
5969725 i had a mary lou retton leotard that i wore all the time
5969726 so when do we get the news that michael phelps has tested positive for outboard motor oil
5969727 thats like putting the entire u s gymnastics team up there
5969728 it was after a few weeks last year a big motivation to fight for the gold medal for her for friends for family
5969729 i left a very special situation at marquette when indiana offered me this opportunity
5969730 i wanted to make sure that if i left i would be going to a place that would be a destination for my family and allow me to build a program for the long haul with the same security
5969731 the united states is the land of opportunity its the best country in the world and im just glad to represent it
5969732 the frustration was let out the hard work and everything
5969733 i set my goal i trained hard i had a good staff around me i just put the pieces together and i really believed in myself
5969734 beating brazil is the best thing i missed many chances against netherlands in the earlier round and luckily for me i scored twice this time
5969735 i have always believed hes got great skill and talent i hope he plays the same in the final
5969736 it was the greatest game for everyone and fortunately we managed to win it
5969737 it doesnt happen very often that you beat brazil 3 nil so we want to enjoy the moment we havent achieved anything yet but beating brazil with a result like this is wonderful
5969738 i understand you have certain people who are supposed to be the favorites but on this particular day at this time you have to run your best race
5969739 im shocked and sad but im really happy for the girls who won

5969741 smart antenna technology can make a huge difference in the overall consumer experience allowing access to all local television signals without having to spend a lot of time aiming or re aiming antennas this technology could be a real game changer
5969742 after months and months of research we came up with a smart antenna that uses reconfigurable elements with performance on par with significantly more expensive antennas normally found in military applications
5969743 this effective and practical design also allows the antenna to be affordable we believe the antenna would not be marketable if the cost exceeded 150

5969746 gymnastics has meant so much to me im going to be busy but id love to keep going
5969747 my body feel pretty good i expected to be hurting more than this i can look forward to the world championships and its definitely possible theres no team competition next year only individual
5969748 if there is anything i can do to make you stay let me know
5969749 it is not a problem related to ethnicity or religion
5969750 we can see from examples of closures of several mosques over the recent years very strict control over religion and also arrests of activists as well as people accused of violent offenses
5969751 usually if a uighur gets in trouble the police come and detain everyone in his family then they lose their jobs and have trouble getting new ones
5969752 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not at all respected by chinese officials inside tibet
5969753 there are restrictions on the circulation of information a very strong censorship and often civilians are arrested and tortured very violently to the point where they die
5969754 the chinese response is that if you put aside this nonsense we will make you wealthy
5969755 its only because they dont have the experience in the gold medal game
5969756 no brazilians no americans theres an element of luck involved
5969757 all the athletes want to come here all the fans want to come here
5969758 i dont blame the basketball players for coming out and watching the women
5969759 not many sports where you can see women wearing bikinis diving around in the sand its a fun sport to watch
5969760 we were up 10 points theres no reason to waste energy

5969762 i like my teammates want to win games murphy said we would all love to win awards but our first priority is to win not pad our stats my goals are to be in atlanta for the southeastern conference championship and play for the national championship
5969763 the basis of the offense is to find advantages in matchups offensive coordinator dan mullen said the more diverse our playmakers are the more mismatches we can find
5969764 the move will better protect the interests of the olympic gold medalists
5969765 were advised to give it to the medalist as a gift
5969766 its only because they dont have the experience in the gold medal game
5969767 no brazilians no americans theres an element of luck involved
5969768 all the athletes want to come here all the fans want to come here
5969769 i dont blame the basketball players for coming out and watching the women
5969770 not many sports where you can see women wearing bikinis diving around in the sand its a fun sport to watch
5969771 we were up 10 points theres no reason to waste energy
5969772 cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who t like them
5969773 sometimes you win sometimes you lose thats the way it is in sports
5969774 unfortunately the olympic gold medal in football will have to wait again
5969775 its another generation that couldnt win the title now all we can do is try to win the bronze
5969776 we have to have the strength to stay motivated in a moment like this
5969777 its not easy but we have to keep working hard just as we had been doing before
5969778 we wouldnt have problems if we won all the time but thats not always possible
5969779 the demands will increase but we will continue our work as planned
5969780 but we have to finish the competition with our heads up and that means with the bronze
5969781 one can justifiably argue the league is the strongest deepest and most respected fcs conference in the nation
5969782 the decision to add north dakota state and south dakota state leaves no doubt
5969783 if it wasnt before it is undoubtedly now the best conference in our division
5969784 were playing ranked teams every week it feels like there is no bye week you have to bring it every week you come to isu and you come to this conference to play the best and beat the best and hopefully we can do that this year
5969785 i was looking at this year as a little bit of a rebuilding year but now its a redemption year we are going to go out there and exceed this years expectations
5969786 the system is basically you play against the defense if you cannot run the football you will not be able to throw it very long at the same time if you cannot throw it you wont be able to run it very long you have to be able to do both and be smart enough to take advantage of what the defense is giving you
5969787 if you go into the season and if youre the guy youre the guy
5969788 brockway is not an unknown quantity to us we have high expectations of him and we have great confidence in him
5969789 i think with blow fisher gordon and mendenhall we have four quality backs here they are a little bit different style of guys i feel like were blessed to have them that might be the best set of four that weve had
5969790 thats the number one goal for everybody on this team i think we are going to have a potent offense we have a lot of people
5969791 we have some veteran guys on offensive lines our offensive tackles are all sophomores and thats a concern our tight ends and backs are going to be a pretty strong force i think we have some quality receivers
5969792 anytime you go into an opener there is quite the sensation of the unknown
5969793 you dont ever really know what youre going to get until you get there
5969794 we had a lot of guys who did not have a lot of game experience this year our main focus is keeping our hands moving keeping our feet moving
5969795 get to the quarterback at all cost dont stop we saw it way too many times last year wed get a rush going and then after more than two seconds wed just put our hands up hoping to block the pass

5969800 i told you rex but you didnt believe me did you its just people that arent in the group who want people in their final five thats all it is its pretty obvious
5969801 when youve been here and been through some of the things weve been through it would be a better atmosphere without nicole she is quite negative about her experience in the big brother house
5969802 she hasnt been through all the stuff we went through to get here this is the end and this should be the fun times we all got the speech from rex that he wants to be here in the final with his girlfriend
5969803 at the deep root of nicoles personality i think she is quite selfish i think she likes everyone running about after her
5969804 sometimes you know i cry and sometimes i scream and i get really angry and i get really upset you know into wallowing in self pity sometimes and i think its all part of the healing
5969805 shes been sort of this quiet warrior in the back and has been a great support and just telling me that i was going to be ok and i knew i was going to be ok ive watched her

5969807 after the failure in athens we put all the critical media articles up on the walls of our gyms
5969808 our success this time can be attributed to our better understanding of the new rules and executing accordingly
5969809 theyre saying they improved the scoring system look at this that makes no sense
5969810 the code is in a permanent evolution various domains will be improved
5969811 so far my career at washburn has been okay this year will be my breakout season
5969812 i think drameagons career is about to take off we knew when he came here that hes talented
5969813 took him a little bit to get in the rotation because weve had good receivers ahead of him then last year he became one of the go to receiver in a number of games
5969814 and it looks like early in fall camp hes going to have an excellent season
5969815 personally football made me more disciplined made me more responsible
5969816 it allowed me to travel to the world of kansas
5969817 as a junior i was all district in my senior year i became all state and i was real good so i came here to washburn
5969818 washburn recruited me my coach sent them a tape one of the former washburn students that used to go here trent hearn we had the same high school football coach so it was just an easy transition from there
5969819 this is really the first time in arguably seven or eight years that the quarterback is a question mark
5969820 there hasnt been a quarterback worry for seven years so this is the first year that it is whoever plays better and whoever has the chops to get it done will get the job
5969821 right now we are evaluating between joe and chris for the one spot
5969822 chris came out of spring ball as our number one but we are still playing joe with the first team its a good opportunity for somebody to step forward and make an impression
5969823 he can do it all for you but he is just a little bit younger and needs to learn a little bit more
5969824 we are all just going out everyday and doing our own thing
5969825 its not up to us but it has brought all of our games to another level its been a grind but none of us are backing down
5969826 i dont think it is ever good to just anoint somebody because that is what athletics are you fight for your job everyday i think it will be interesting to watch this especially for the fans and see who pulls out with the job
5969827 the two offenders then ran back from the bank and towards their getaway car supt cotter said in parramatta today
5969828 en route one of the men ran towards the third security guard who was positioned across the road adjacent to the getaway car and raised his firearm at the guard and the guard in self defence fired one shot
5969829 we strongly believe the shot from that guards gun hit the person in the chest region and flowing from that the offender dropped his gun
5969830 an autopsy this morning has revealed that the cause of death for this man was a gunshot wound to the chest
5969831 all the preliminary advice to me would place the fact that self defence was certainly an option supt cotter said
5969832 significant rattled by the shooting but would not give any further details

5969840 the department of foreign affairs and trade very much regrets the circulation of the biography by the australian high commission in wellington of an outdated internal draft which was a mistake dfat said in a statement
5969841 commissioner john dauth has apologised to ms clark who has accepted the apology
5969842 ms clark has said publicly she regarded the incident as a pretty minor thing and she had had a bit of a laugh
5969843 newly formed governing arrangements with nz first and united future which happened soon after the 2005 new zealand election
5969844 i am a bit surprised that dfat would draw up something that was clearly written about the time of the last election there you go maybe they need to be more efficient miss clark said
5969845 i think it is a pretty minor thing i had a bit of a laugh
